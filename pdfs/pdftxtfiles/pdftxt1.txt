Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
(the Authority) as of and for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements, as listed in 
the table of contents. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We 
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.

Opinion 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the Authority as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the changes in its financial position 
and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America. 

Emphasis of Matter 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2018, the Authority changed its method of 
accounting for previously reported goodwill with the adoption of Governmental Accounting Standards 
Board Statement No. 85, Omnibus 2017.  Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 
discussion and analysis and pension information, as listed in the table of contents, be presented to 
supplement the basic financial statements.  Such information, although not a part of the basic financial 
statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an 
essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate 
operational, economic or historical context.   

We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of 
management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for 
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements and other 
knowledge we obtained during our audits of the basic financial statements.  We do not express an opinion 
or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with 
sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Combining Information 

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the Authority’s basic financial statements.  The accompanying combining 
information, as listed in the table of contents, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a 
required part of the financial statements.  The combining information is the responsibility of management 
and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the basic financial statements.  Such information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures 
applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or 
provide any assurance on it. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 10, 
2019, on our consideration of the Authority’s internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial

reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal 
control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Authority’s internal control over 
financial reporting and compliance.

The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
 

 4 

Introduction 

This management’s discussion and analysis of the financial performance of The Comanche County 
Hospital Authority (the Authority) provides an overview of the Authority’s financial activities for the 
years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial 
statements of the Authority.  Unless otherwise indicated, dollar amounts are in thousands. 

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Authority’s financial statements include the 
operations of Comanche County Memorial Hospital (CCMH), McMahon-Tomlinson Nursing Center 
(MTNC) and Lawton Community Health Center (LCHC), which are considered operating divisions of the 
Authority.  

Financial Highlights 

 Cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased in 2018 by $4,071 or 7% and increased in 2017 by 
$3,660 or 7%. 

 Capital assets, net decreased by $4,431 or 4% in 2018 and decreased by $4,398 or 4% in 2017. 

 Long-term debt decreased by $6,577 or 7% in 2018 and increased by $1,384 or 1% in 2017. 

 The Authority reported operating income of $2,751 and $2,791 in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

 The Authority’s net position increased by $1,422 or 2% in 2018 and increased by $2,379 or 3% in 
2017. 

Using This Annual Report 

The Authority’s financial statements consist of three statements—a balance sheet; a statement of 
revenues, expenses and changes in net position; and a statement of cash flows.  These statements provide 
information about the activities of the Authority, including resources held by the Authority but restricted 
for specific purposes by creditors, contributors, grantors or enabling legislation.  The Authority is 
accounted for as a business-type activity and presents its financial statements using the economic 
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. 

The Balance Sheet and Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position 

One of the most important questions asked about any health care organization’s finances is, “Is the 
organization as a whole better or worse off as a result of the year’s activities?”  The balance sheet and the 
statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position report information about the Authority’s 
resources and its activities in a way that helps answer this question.  These statements include all 
restricted and unrestricted assets and deferred outflows of resources and all liabilities and deferred inflows 
of resources using the accrual basis of accounting.  Using the accrual basis of accounting means that all of 
the current year’s revenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or 
paid. 



 

 5 

These two statements report the Authority’s net position and changes in it.  The Authority’s total net 
position—the difference between assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred 
inflows of resources—is one measure of the Authority’s financial health or financial position.  Over time, 
increases or decreases in the Authority’s net position are an indicator of whether its financial health is 
improving or deteriorating.  Other nonfinancial factors, such as changes in the Authority’s patient base, 
changes in legislation and regulations, measures of the quantity and quality of services provided to its 
patients and local economic factors, should also be considered to assess the overall financial health of the 
Authority.  

The Statement of Cash Flows 

The statement of cash flows reports cash receipts, cash payments and net changes in cash and cash 
equivalents resulting from four defined types of activities.  It provides answers to such questions as where 
did cash come from, what was cash used for and what was the change in cash and cash equivalents during 
the reporting period.  

The Authority’s Net Position 

The Authority’s net position is the difference between its assets and deferred outflows of resources and 
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources reported in the balance sheet.  The Authority’s net position 
increased by $1,422 or 2% in 2018 and increased by $2,379 or 3% in 2017 as shown in Table 1.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 by $4,071 or 7% as the 
Authority continued to see strong cash flows from operations coupled with a decline in cash flows from 
investing activities.  Capital assets, net decreased in 2018 by $4,431 or 4% due to depreciation in the 
current year exceeding capital asset additions.  Net pension liability decreased in 2018 compared to 2017 
by $835 or 4% due primarily to increased Authority contributions in 2018. 

Cash, cash equivalents and investments increased in 2017 compared to 2016 by $3,660 or 7% as the 
Authority continued to see strong cash flows from operations coupled with the incurrence of new debt to 
fund the completion of the emergency department renovation.  Capital assets, net decreased in 2017 by 
$4,398 or 4% due to depreciation in the current year exceeding capital asset additions.  Net pension 
liability increased in 2017 compared to 2016 by $1,964 or 10% due primarily to changes in actuarial 
assumptions in 2017.

Operating Income (Loss) 

The first component of the overall change in the Authority’s net position is its operating income or loss—
generally, the difference between net patient service and other operating revenues and the expenses 
incurred to perform those services. 

Operating results for 2018 decreased by $40 compared to the operating income in 2017 of $2,791.  The 
primary components of the change in operating results are: 

 An increase in net patient service revenue of $4,616 or 2% in conjunction with an increase in 
outpatient oncology services 



 

 8 

 An increase in operating expenses of $4,510 or 2%, the primary components of which are: 

o An increase in salaries and wages and employee benefits of $2,743 or 2% in connection with the 
Authority’s annual retention and recruitment efforts, particularly concerning registered nurses and 
physicians 

o An increase in purchased services and professional fees of $3,181 or 5% as a result of increases in 
patient volumes 

Operating results for 2017 increased by $4,307 compared to the operating loss in 2016 of $1,516.  The 
primary components of the change in operating results are: 

 An increase in net patient service revenue of $15,009 or 6% in conjunction with an increase of 10% 
in inpatient days 

 An increase in operating expenses of $8,729 or 3%, the primary components of which are: 

o An increase in salaries and wages and employee benefits of $6,849 or 5% in connection with the 
Authority’s annual retention and recruitment efforts, particularly concerning registered nurses and 
physicians 

o A decrease in purchased services and professional fees of $1,990 or 3% primarily related to 
reductions in contract labor for registered nurses and locum physicians in conjunction with the 
Authority’s retention and recruitment efforts 

o An increase in medical supplies and drugs of $3,228 or 9% as a result of increases in patient 
volumes in conjunction with increases in the costs of certain surgical supplies and implants 

Nonoperating Revenues (Expenses) 

Nonoperating revenues (expenses) consist primarily of investment income, gain on investments in joint 
ventures, noncapital grants and gifts and interest expense.  The Authority’s total debt in 2018 and 2017 
exceeded cash and investments and, as a result, interest expense exceeded investment income.   

The Authority’s Cash Flows 

Changes in the Authority’s cash flows are generally consistent with changes in operating income (loss) 
and nonoperating revenues (expenses), with the exception of changes in capital assets, net and long-term 
debt discussed above. 

Capital Asset and Debt Administration 

Capital Assets 

At the end of 2018, the Authority had $109,027 invested in capital assets, net of accumulated

acquired capital assets costing $7,712. 

At the end of 2017, the Authority had $113,458 invested in capital assets, net of accumulated

payable and capital lease obligations outstanding as detailed in Note 8 to the accompanying financial 
statements.  During 2018, the Authority incurred $837 for the purchase of real estate.  During 2017, the 
Authority incurred $1,008 for a new capital lease obligation, incurred $4,000 for a new note payable and 
drew an additional $3,233 on an existing note payable.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Authority’s debt 
rating was BB+.

Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations and Reporting Entity 

The Comanche County Hospital Authority (the Authority), a public trust, was created on 
January 13, 1971, by the Board of Commissioners of Comanche County, Oklahoma (the County), 
to operate, control and manage all matters concerning Comanche County Memorial Hospital 
(CCMH), McMahon-Tomlinson Nursing Center (MTNC) and the trust estate.  The Board of 
Commissioners of the County appoints the members of the Authority’s Board of Trustees. 

On January 13, 1971, an indenture of lease was entered into between the County (the Lessor) and 
the trustees of the Authority (the Lessee) leasing to the Authority all hospital and nursing center 
sites, equipment and facilities owned and subsequently constructed or acquired by the Lessor or 
under its custody, management or control.  The initial term of the lease was for a period of 30 years 
and so long thereafter as any indebtedness incurred by the Lessee and secured by the revenues of 
any of the leased property remains unpaid.  In addition, the lease agreement provided the Authority 
certain renewal options.  Consideration for the lease is the installation and construction of 
improvements to the leased property for the purpose of aiding the Lessor in the performance of its 
public functions.  In July 2000, the Authority exercised an option to renew the lease for an 
additional 30-year period ending in January 2031. 

CCMH primarily earns revenue by providing inpatient, outpatient and emergency care services to 
patients in southwestern Oklahoma.  CCMH also operates a rehabilitation unit, a psychiatric unit, 
outpatient clinics, a home health agency and an ambulance service in the same geographic area.   

MTNC earns revenues by providing intermediate nursing care services in a 146-bed nursing facility 
in Lawton, Oklahoma. 

On September 1, 2007, the Authority was awarded a grant by the Health Resources and Services 
Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to partially fund the 
operations and activities of the Lawton Community Health Center (LCHC), a federally qualified 
health center (FQHC).  LCHC is an operating division of the Authority and operates the FQHC 
under a co-applicant agreement with Lawton Community Health Center, Inc., a not-for-profit 
organization. 

Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the accompanying 
financial statements of the Authority are comprised of CCMH, MTNC and LCHC, which are 
considered operating divisions of the Authority.  All transactions and accounts between CCMH, 
MTNC and LCHC have been eliminated in the accompanying financial statements. 

Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The accompanying financial statements of the Authority have been prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting using the economic resources measurement focus.  Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, 
assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources from 
exchange and exchange-like transactions are recognized when the exchange transaction takes place, 
while those from government-mandated nonexchange transactions (principally, federal and state 



The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
 

 14 

grants) are recognized when all applicable eligibility requirements are met.  Operating revenues 
and expenses include exchange transactions and program-specific, government-mandated 
nonexchange transactions.  Investment income and interest on capital assets-related debt are 
included in nonoperating revenues and expenses.  The Authority first applies restricted net position 
when an expense or outlay is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net 
position are available. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and 
deferred inflows of resources and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash Equivalents 

The Authority considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be 
cash equivalents excluding investments in noncurrent cash and investments.  At June 30, 2018 and 
2017, cash equivalents consisted of money market mutual funds with brokers. 

Risk Management 

The Authority is exposed to various risks of loss from torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 
assets; business interruption; errors and omissions; employee injuries and illnesses; natural 
disasters; medical malpractice; and employee health, dental and accident benefits.  Commercial 
insurance coverage is purchased for claims arising from such matters other than unemployment; 
workers’ compensation; and employee health, dental and short-term disability.  Settled claims have 
not exceeded this commercial coverage in any of the three preceding years. 

The Authority is self-insured for a portion of its exposure to risk of loss from unemployment, 
employee health, dental, short-term disability and workers’ compensation claims.  Annual 
estimated provisions are accrued for the self-insured portion of these claims and include an 
estimate of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. 

Investments and Investment Income 

The investments in joint ventures are reported on the equity method of accounting.  All other 
investments are carried at fair value, which is determined using quoted market prices.  Investment 
income includes dividend and interest income, realized gains and losses on investments carried at 
other than fair value and the net change for the year in the fair value of investments carried at fair 
value.

Patient Accounts Receivable 

The Authority reports patient accounts receivable for services rendered at net realizable amounts 
from third-party payers, patients and others.  The Authority provides an allowance for uncollectible 
accounts based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information and 
existing economic conditions.  As a service to the patient, the Authority bills third-party payers 
directly and bills the patient when the patient’s liability is determined.  Patient accounts receivable 
are due in full when billed.  Accounts are considered delinquent and subsequently written off as 
uncollectible accounts based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the 
account. 

Supplies 

Supply inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out method, or 
market. 

Capital Assets 

Capital assets are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition or acquisition value at the date of 
donation if acquired by gift.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful life of each asset.  Assets under capital lease obligations are depreciated over the 
shorter of the lease term or their respective estimated useful lives.  The following estimated useful 
lives are being used by the Authority: 

Land improvements 5–20 years
Buildings and improvements 10–50 years
Equipment 3–20 years

 
 

The Authority capitalizes interest costs as a component of construction in progress based on the 
weighted-average rates paid for long-term borrowing.  Total interest incurred was: 

2018 2017

Interest costs capitalized 48,554$            696,117$          
Interest costs and other financing costs charged to expense 3,563,219         3,052,963         

Total interest incurred 3,611,773$       3,749,080$       

 
Compensated Absences 

Authority policies permit most employees to accumulate paid days off benefits that may be realized 
as paid time off or, in limited circumstances, as a cash payment.  Expense and the related liability 
are recognized as benefits are earned whether the employee is expected to realize the benefit as 
time off or in cash.  Compensated absence liabilities are computed using the regular pay rates in 



The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
 

 16 

effect at the balance sheet date plus an additional amount for compensation-related payments, such 
as Social Security and Medicare taxes, computed using rates in effect at that date.   

Defined Benefit Pension Plan  

The Authority has a single-employer defined benefit pension plan, the Comanche County Hospital 
Authority Employee Retirement Plan (the Plan).  For purposes of measuring the net pension 
liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and 
pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Plan and additions 
to/deductions from the Plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as 
they are reported by the Plan.  For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee 
contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.  
Investments are reported at fair value. 

Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources 

The Authority is required to account for certain transactions that do not qualify for treatment as 
either assets or liabilities as deferred outflows or inflows of resources.  Deferred outflows and 
inflows of resources are defined as a consumption (deferred outflows) or an acquisition (deferred 
inflows) of net position by the Authority that is applicable to a future reporting period. 

The Authority adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 85, 
Omnibus 2017, regarding the classification of goodwill.  Prior to the fiscal year 2015 
implementation of GASB Statement No. 69, Government Combinations and Disposals of 
Government Operations, entities reported goodwill, or excess consideration paid in an acquisition, 
as an asset.  For such amounts, GASB 85 clarifies that entities should reclassify goodwill as a 
deferred outflow of resources.  Based on these requirements, the Authority now reports goodwill as 
deferred outflows of resources.  This did not have a material impact on the accompanying financial 
statements. 

At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the deferred inflows and outflows of resources reported by the 
Authority on the accompanying balance sheets consisted of the following items: 

2018 2017

Deferred inflows related to pensions 15,367$            60,568$            

Loss on defeasance of long-term debt, net 955,676$          1,119,795$       
Excess consideration paid in an acquisition 4,376,636         4,867,473         
Deferred outflows related to pensions 3,511,524         4,918,167         

Total deferred outflows 8,843,836$       10,905,435$

Net Position 

Net position of the Authority is classified in three components.  Net investment in capital assets 
consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances 
of borrowings used to finance the purchase or construction of those assets.  Restricted expendable 
net position is made up of noncapital assets that must be used for a particular purpose, as specified 
by creditors, grantors or donors external to the Authority, including amounts deposited with 
trustees as required by bond indentures, reduced by the outstanding balances of any related 
borrowings.  Unrestricted net position is the remaining net position that does not meet the 
definition of net investment in capital assets or restricted net position. 

Net Patient Service Revenue 

The Authority has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments to the Authority at 
amounts different from its established rates.  Net patient service revenue is reported at the 
estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payers and others for services rendered 
and includes estimated retroactive revenue adjustments and a provision for uncollectible accounts.  
Retroactive adjustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the 
period the related services are rendered and such estimated amounts are revised in future periods as 
adjustments become known. 

Charity Care 

The Authority provides care without charge or at amounts less than its established rates to patients 
meeting certain criteria under its charity care policy.  Because the Authority does not pursue 
collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, the amounts are not reported as net 
patient service revenue. 

Income Taxes 

As an essential government function of the County, the Authority is exempt from federal and state 
income taxes under Section 115 of the Internal Revenue Code and a similar provision of state law.  
However, the Authority is subject to federal income tax on any unrelated business taxable income. 

Foundation 

The Authority is the beneficiary of Comanche County Memorial Hospital Foundation (the 
Foundation), a separate legal entity with its own board of directors.  The Foundation has legal title 
to all of the Foundation’s assets.  The Foundation is not a component unit of the Authority and, 
thus, is not reflected in the accompanying financial statements. 

Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program 

On January 17, 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved the State 
of Oklahoma’s Supplemental Hospital Offset Payment Program (SHOPP).  The SHOPP is 
currently scheduled to sunset on December 31, 2020.  The SHOPP is designed to assess Oklahoma 



The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
 

 18 

hospitals a supplemental hospital offset fee, which is placed in pools after receiving federal 
matching funds.  The total fees and matching funds are then allocated to hospitals as directed by 
legislation. 

SHOPP revenue is recorded as part of net patient service revenue and SHOPP assessment fees are 
recorded as part of other expenses on the accompanying statements of revenues, expenses and 
changes in net position.  The amounts noted in the table below for the years ended June 30, 2018 
and 2017, represent the approximate amounts received and paid by the Authority.  The annual 
amounts to be received and paid by the Authority over the term of the SHOPP are subject to 
change annually based on various factors involved in determining the amount of federal matching 
funds.  Based on the current information available, the annual net benefit to the Authority over the 
term of the SHOPP is not expected to be materially different from the net amounts received in 
2018. 

2018 2017

SHOPP funds received 15,153,660$     14,272,000$     
SHOPP assessment fees paid 6,103,000         6,023,000         

Net SHOPP benefit 9,050,660$       8,249,000$       

 
Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs  

The Electronic Health Records Incentive Programs, enacted as part of the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, provide for one-time incentive payments under both the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs to eligible hospitals and physicians that demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified electronic health records (EHR) technology.  Payments under the Medicare program are 
generally made for up to four years based on a statutory formula.  Payments under the Medicaid 
program are generally made for three years based on a statutory formula, as determined by the 
state, which is approved by CMS.  Payments under both programs are contingent on the hospital 
continuing to meet escalating meaningful use criteria and any other specific requirements that are 
applicable for the reporting period.  The final amount for any payment year is determined based on 
an audit by the administrative contractor.  Events could occur that would cause the final amounts to 
differ materially from the initial payments under the programs.  

The Authority recognizes revenue ratably over the reporting period starting at the point when 
management is reasonably assured it will meet all of the meaningful use objectives and any other 
specific grant requirements applicable for the reporting period.   

CCMH attested to meeting the fourth-year requirements under the Medicare program during the 
year ended June 30, 2017.  The revenue related to these programs for the years ended June 30, 
2018 and 2017, which is included in other revenue on the accompanying statements of revenues, 
expenses and changes in net position, were approximately $12,000 and $598,000, respectively.

Revisions  

Certain immaterial revisions have been made to the 2017 financial statements for amounts reported 
as estimated amounts due to third-party payers, patient accounts receivable, net of allowance and 
disclosures about investments in joint ventures in Note 13.  These revisions did not have a 
significant impact on the financial statement line items impacted. 

Note 2: Net Patient Service Revenue 

CCMH, MTNC and LCHC have agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments to 
them at amounts different from their established rates.  Those payment arrangements include: 

 Medicare – Substantially all inpatient acute care services and outpatient services rendered to 
Medicare program beneficiaries, including physician services, are paid at prospectively 
determined rates.  These rates vary according to patient classification systems that are based on 
clinical, diagnostic and other factors.  CCMH, MTNC and LCHC are reimbursed for certain 
services at tentative rates with final settlement determined after submission of annual cost 
reports by the Authority and audits thereof by the Medicare administrative contractor.   

 Medicaid – CCMH, MTNC and LCHC have also been reimbursed for services rendered to 
patients covered by the state Medicaid program.  CCMH is reimbursed on a prospective basis 
at prospectively determined rates per discharge and fee schedules with no retroactive 
adjustment.  MTNC is reimbursed for services to residents who are Medicaid beneficiaries at 
prospectively determined per diem rates with no retroactive adjustment.  LCHC is reimbursed 
for services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries at prospectively determined rates with no 
retroactive adjustment. 

Approximately 61% and 63% of net patient service revenue is from participation in the Medicare 
and state-sponsored Medicaid programs for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  
Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex and subject to 
interpretation and change.  As a result, it is reasonably possible that recorded estimates will change 
materially in the near term. 

The Authority has also entered into payment agreements with certain commercial insurance 
carriers, health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.  The basis for 
payment under these agreements includes prospectively determined rates per discharge, discounts 
from established charges and prospectively determined daily rates. 

Grant Revenue 

The Authority is the recipient of a Community Health Center (CHC) grant from the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services.  The general purpose of the grant is to provide 
expanded health care service delivery in Lawton, Oklahoma, and surrounding areas.  Terms of the 
grant generally provide for funding of LCHC’s operations based on an approved budget.  Grant 
revenue is recognized as qualifying expenditures are incurred over the grant period.  During the

years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Authority received approximately $3,001,000 and 
$2,024,000, respectively, in CHC grant funds. 

Note 3: Deposits, Investments and Investment Income 

Deposits 

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure a government’s deposits may not 
be returned to it.  The Authority’s deposit policy for custodial credit risk requires collateralization 
of all deposits with federal depository insurance and other acceptable collateral in specific amounts.   

At June 30, 2018 and 2017, approximately $162,000 and $0 of the Authority’s bank balances of 
approximately $10,409,000 and $15,153,000, respectively, were exposed to custodial credit risk as 
follows: 

2018 2017

Uninsured and uncollateralized 162,000$          -$                     
Uninsured and collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit from the
  Federal Home Loan Bank 10,247,000       15,153,000       

Total interest incurred 10,409,000$     15,153,000$     

 
Investments 

The Authority has an investment policy related to its investment portfolio.  This policy does not 
apply to investments held under trustee agreements related to bond indentures.

Maturities in Years

 
 Interest Rate Risk – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely 

affect the fair value of an investment.  As a means of limiting its exposure to fair value losses 
arising from rising interest rates, the Authority’s investment policy limits the sale of securities 
on the open market prior to maturity and directly investing in securities maturing more than 
five years from the date of purchase.  The Authority has also adopted weighted-average 
limitations not to exceed three years.  The money market mutual funds are presented as 
investments with maturities of less than one year because the average maturity of the funds is 
less than one year. 

 Credit Risk – Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to an investment will 
not fulfill its obligations.  It is the Authority’s policy to limit its investments to securities with a 
Standard & Poor’s (S & P) credit rating of AAA or Moody’s credit rating of Aaa.  U.S. 
Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, certificates of 
deposit and money market mutual funds are acceptable security types under the Authority’s 
investment policy.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Authority’s investments not directly 
guaranteed by the U.S. government were rated as follows: 

Type Moody’s S & P Moody’s S & P

Mortgage- and asset-backed 
  securities of U.S. agencies Aaa AA+ Aaa AA+
Money market mutual funds Aaa AAA Aaa AAA

2018 2017

 
 Custodial Credit Risk – For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of 

the failure of the counterparty the Authority will not be able to recover the value of its 
investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.  At June 30, 
2018 and 2017, the Authority’s investments in mortgage- and asset-backed securities are held 
by counterparties in other than the Authority’s name.  The Authority’s investment policy does 
not address how securities underlying repurchase agreements are to be held.

 22 

 Concentration of Credit Risk – The Authority limits the types of securities purchased to U.S. 
Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency and instrumentality obligations, money market 
mutual funds, equity securities and certificates of deposit fully covered by FDIC limits.  The 
Authority’s investment policy does not place a limit on the amount that may be invested in any 
one issuer.  

At June 30, 2018, the following investments exceeded 5% of the total fair value of all investments: 

Percentage

Federal National Mortgage Association 6,511,755$       15.1%

Note 6: Medical Malpractice Claims 

The Authority purchases medical malpractice insurance for services under a claims-made policy on 
a fixed premium basis.  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
require a health care provider to accrue the expense of its share of malpractice claim costs, if any, 
for any reported and unreported incidents of potential improper professional service occurring 
during the year by estimating the probable costs of such incidents.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the 
Authority accrued approximately $300,000 and $250,000, respectively, based on its claims 
experience for these claims.  It is reasonably possible that these estimates could change materially 
in the near term.  

Because the Authority was created by the County, management believes the limit of liability for 
any individual tort claim not covered by insurance would be limited to $125,000 under Oklahoma 
state law. 

Note 7: Self-Insured Claims 

The Authority sponsors short-term disability, health and dental care plans and a workers’ 
compensation plan for its employees.  These plans are self-insured to the extent of the deductible 
amounts under the excess risk insurance policies the Authority has obtained.  These self-insured 
amounts are currently as follows: 

 Workers’ compensation – first $450,000 per accident 

 Health and dental care – first $350,000 per person per year 



The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
 

 26 

A provision is accrued for self-insured workers’ compensation and health and dental care claim 
costs, including both claims reported and claims incurred but not yet reported.  The accrual is 
estimated based on consideration of prior claims experience, recently settled claims, frequency of 
claims and other economic and social factors.  It is reasonably possible the Authority’s estimate 
will change by a material amount in the near term.   

Activity in the Authority’s accrued liability for self-insured plans, included in accrued expenses 
and other long-term liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets, during the years ended June 30 
is summarized as follows:

In June 2018 and 2017, the Oklahoma Workers’ Compensation Court required the Authority to 
post collateral for self-insured claims in the form of letters of credit with a bank in the amount of 
$500,000 and $792,000, respectively, in the event the Authority was unable to pay its claims.  As 
of the date of the Independent Auditor’s Report, no amounts have been drawn on these letters of 
credit.

Revenue Bonds Payable 

The revenue bonds payable consist of the following: 

 Series 2012A Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds (Series 2012A Revenue Bonds), in the

payable semiannually.  Principal is payable in annual installments through July 2042.  The 
Authority is required to make monthly deposits to the debt service fund held by the trustee.  All 
of the bonds still outstanding may be redeemed at the Authority’s option on or after July 1, 
2022, at a redemption price of 100%.  The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the 
Authority and the assets restricted under the bond indenture agreement.  The principal of these 
bonds was split between CCMH and MTNC.  The allocation of the principal amounts and 
respective maturity dates related to CCMH and MTNC are as follows:

McMahon-Tomlinson Nursing Center 12,025,000       July 2042

36,790,000$     

 
When the Series 2012A Revenue Bonds were issued, the bonds were sold at a premium of 
approximately $2,162,000.  At June 30, the outstanding balance of the Series 2012A Revenue 
Bonds was as follows: 

2018 2017

Principal amount 32,445,000$     33,390,000$     
Plus unamortized premium 1,263,275         1,400,009         

Net amount outstanding 33,708,275$     34,790,009$     

 
 Series 2012B Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds (the Series 2012B Revenue Bonds), in the 

original amount of $9,830,000 dated December 14, 2012, bear interest at 3.43% to 5.90%, 
payable semiannually.  Principal is payable in annual installments through July 2027.  The 
Authority is required to make monthly deposits to the debt service fund held by the trustee.  All 
of the bonds still outstanding may be redeemed at the Authority’s option on or after July 1, 
2022, at a redemption price of 100%.  The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the 
Authority and the assets restricted under the bond indenture agreement. 

 Series 2015 Hospital Revenue Refunding Bonds (the Series 2015 Revenue Bonds), in the 
original amount of $41,575,000 dated April 7, 2015, bear interest at 3.13% to 5.00%, payable 
semiannually.  Principal is payable in annual installments through July 2029 and was used to 
refund the Series 2005 Revenue Bonds and a portion of one of the notes payable to bank.  The

Authority is required to make monthly deposits to the debt service fund held by the trustee.  All 
of the bonds still outstanding may be redeemed at the Authority’s option on or after July 1, 
2025, at a redemption price of 100%.  The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the 
Authority and the assets restricted under the bond indenture agreement. 

When the Series 2015 Revenue Bonds were issued, the bonds were sold at a premium of 
approximately $3,754,000.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the outstanding balance of the Series 
2015 Revenue Bonds was as follows: 

2018 2017

Principal amount 33,045,000$     35,900,000$     
Plus unamortized premium 2,224,588         2,665,952         

Net amount outstanding 35,269,588$     38,565,952$     

 
The revenue bonds’ indenture agreements require that certain funds be established with the trustee.  
Accordingly, these funds are included as assets held by trustee for debt service in the 
accompanying balance sheets.  The indentures also require the Authority to comply with certain 
restrictive covenants, including minimum insurance coverage, maintaining a debt service coverage 
ratio of at least 1.10 to 1.00, restrictions on incurrence of additional debt and maintaining a 
minimum days cash on hand.   

In prior years, the Authority had advance refunded four different revenue bond issues and each of 
these advance refunding transactions resulted in extinguishment of debt since the Authority was 
legally released from its obligation on those bond series.   

The prior advance refunding transactions resulted in an accounting loss on the extinguishment of 
the long-term debt.  This loss on refunding is shown as deferred outflows of resources on the 
accompanying balance sheets and is being amortized using the straight-line method over the life of 
the respective new bond issues.

Note Payable to Bank (A) 

The first note payable to bank was entered into by the Authority in October 2013 in the original 
amount of $27,000,000 with $18,000,000 being a variable rate note and $9,000,000 being a fixed 
rate note.  The proceeds of the note were used by CCMH and MTNC.   

In April 2015, the Authority amended the note payable to bank.  The amended debt combined the 
two separate notes into one note carrying a fixed interest rate of 3.25% annually.  The amended 
note matures on the earlier of April 7, 2025, or as the loan becomes due and payable pursuant to the 
repayment schedule.  The amended note allowed for draws on the note up to $16,835,000 through 
December 31, 2015.  Payments of principal and interest are due monthly in the amount of 
$164,892. 

In October 2016, the Authority further amended the note payable allowing for draws on the note 
through December 31, 2017.

Note 9: Charity Care and Other Community Benefits 

In support of its mission, the Authority voluntarily provides free care to patients who lack financial 
resources and are deemed to be medically indigent.  Because the Authority does not pursue 
collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported in net patient 
service revenue.   

The costs of charity care provided under the Authority’s charity care policy were approximately 
$1,881,000 and $1,087,000 for 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The cost of charity care is estimated 
by applying the ratio of costs to gross charges from the most recent Medicare cost report. 

In addition to uncompensated care, the Authority also commits significant time and resources to 
endeavors and critical services that meet otherwise unfilled community needs.  Many of these 
activities are sponsored with the knowledge that they will not be self-supporting or financially 
viable.  Such programs include health screenings and assessments, prenatal education and care, 
community educational services, ambulance services, rural clinics and various support groups. 

Note 10: Pension Plan 

Plan Description 

The Authority maintains the Comanche County Hospital Authority Employee Retirement Plan (the 
Plan), a single-employer defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees.  The 
Plan is administered by the Plan’s board of trustees whose members are appointed by the 
Authority’s governing body.  Benefit provisions are contained in the plan document and were 
established and can be amended by action of the Authority’s governing body.  The Plan does not 
issue a separate report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information 
for the Plan.   

Benefits Provided 

The Plan provides retirement, disability and death benefits to plan members and their beneficiaries.  
Retirement benefits for employees are calculated as 0.6% of the participant’s Final Average 
Compensation, as defined by the Plan, multiplied by the participant’s years of credited service at 
retirement or termination.  Death benefits are equal to the vested benefits and allow for qualifying 
surviving spouses to receive 50% of the amount the participant would have received.  The normal 
retirement age under the Plan is 65, with certain defined exceptions.

The employees covered by the Plan at June 30 are: 

2018 2017

Inactive employees or beneficiaries currently receiving benefits 322                   298                   
Inactive employees entitled to but not yet receiving benefits 287                   266                   
Active employees 959                   1,117                

1,568                1,681                

 
Contributions  

The Authority’s governing body has the authority to establish and amend the contribution 
requirements of the Authority and active employees.  The governing body establishes rates based 
on an actuarially determined rate recommended by an independent actuary.  The actuarially 
determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by 
employees during the year with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability.  
For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the Authority contributed approximately $4,065,000 
and $2,305,000, respectively, to the Plan.  Participants do not contribute to the Plan. 

Net Pension Liability 

The Authority’s net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the total 
pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by actuarial valuations 
as of those dates. 

The total pension liability in the June 30, 2018 and 2017, actuarial valuations was determined using 
the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement: 

2018 2017

Inflation 2.000% 2.000%
Salary increase (average, including inflation) 2.000% 3.000%
Investment rate of return (net of pension plan investment expense)  6.500% 6.625%

 
Mortality rates were based on the 2016 IRS Prescribed Mortality – Optional Combined Table for 
Small Plans – Male and Female for the 2017 valuation and on the Adjusted RP-2014 Blue Collar 
Mortality with Improvement Scale MP-2017 for the 2018 valuation.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a 
building-block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of 
pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.  These 
expected future real rates of return are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return 
by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and 
by adding expected inflation.  The target allocation and best estimates of rates of return for each 
major asset class are summarized in the following table:

Discount Rate 

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 6.500% and 6.625% for the years 
ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The projection of cash flows used to determine the 
discount rate assumed that the Authority’s contributions will be made at rates equal to the 
actuarially determined contribution rates.  Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary 
net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current 
plan members.  Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was 
applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

Total plan fiduciary net position 48,035,891$      44,380,978$      

 
Investment Policy – Investment policy decisions are established and maintained by the 
Administrative Committee charged with overseeing the pension plan, as authorized by the 
Authority’s Board of Trustees.  The Administrative Committee employs and selects investment 
managers. 

The primary goal of a pension fund is to help pay the cost of the pension plan while providing 
adequate security to meet the benefits promised under the pension plan.  As a consequence, two 
important dimensions of a pension plan’s investment program are expected return and expected 
risk. 

The pension plan trustees diversify pension plan investments among asset classes, recognizing that 
there is a relationship between the level of risk assumed in an investment program and the level of 
return that should be expected.  Appropriate diversification better enables balance of risk and 
return.   

Investment Rate of Return – The annual money-weighted rate of return on pension plan 
investments, net of expenses, which expresses net investment performance adjusted for changing 
amounts actually invested each month was approximately 7.1% for the 12 months ended June 30, 
2018. 

Credit Risk – Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not 
fulfill its obligations.  The Plan does not have a separate policy covering credit risk. 

Custodial Credit Risk – For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of the 
failure of the counterparty the Authority will not be able to recover the value of its investment or 
collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party.  The Plan’s investment policy 
does not address how investments are to be held. 

Concentration of Credit Risk – The Plan does not have a policy to limit its holdings in any one 
issuer.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, all of the Plan’s investments were held through the Plan’s 
investment manager, The Principal Group.

Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within 
Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.  If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are 
estimated by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset 
pricing services and pricing models, the inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced 
market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, 
prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows.  Such securities are classified in 
Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.  In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not 
available, securities are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy.  The Plan did not hold any 
Level 1 or Level 3 securities at June 30, 2018 or 2017.

Note 11: Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value measurements must maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There is a hierarchy of three levels 
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets; 
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can 
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the 
assets 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the 
fair value of the assets 

Recurring Measurements 

The following tables present the fair value measurements of assets recognized in the accompanying

Complete financial statements of the joint venture entities may be obtained by contacting the 
Authority’s management. 

Note 14: Contingencies 

Litigation 

In the normal course of business, the Authority is, from time to time, subject to allegations that may 
or do result in litigation.  Some of these allegations are in areas not covered by commercial 
insurance, for example, allegations regarding employment practices or performance of contracts.  
The Authority evaluates such allegations by conducting investigations to determine the validity of 
each potential claim.  Based upon the advice of legal counsel, management records an estimate of 
the amount of ultimate expected loss, if any, for each.  Events could occur that would cause the 
estimate of ultimate loss to differ materially in the near term.

Notes to Schedule 

1. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (Schedule) includes the federal 
award activity of The Comanche County Hospital Authority (Authority) under programs of the 
federal government for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The information in this Schedule is 
presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 
200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of 
the operations of the Authority, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, 
changes in net position or cash flows of the Authority. 

2. Expenditures reported on the Schedule are reported on the accrual basis of accounting.  Such 
expenditures are recognized following the cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance, 
wherein certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement.  
Negative amounts shown on the Schedule, if any, represent adjustments or credits made in the 
normal course of business to amounts reported as expenditures in prior years.  The Authority 
has elected not to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform 
Guidance. 

3.  The Comanche County Hospital Authority did not have any federal loan programs during the 
year ended June 30, 2018.



 

 

 
 
 

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and on 
Compliance and Other Matters Based on an 

Audit of Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards 

 
Independent Auditor’s Report 

 
 
 

Board of Trustees 
The Comanche County Hospital Authority 
Lawton, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of The Comanche County 
Hospital Authority (Authority), which comprise the balance sheet as of June 30, 2018, and the related 
statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net position and cash flows for the year then ended, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated January 10, 2019, 
which contained an Emphasis of Matter paragraph regarding a change in accounting principles. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Authority’s internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.  Accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or 
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement 
of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less 
severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Authority’s financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material 
effect on the determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on 
compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express 
such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that 
are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of This Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance.  
Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report on Compliance for the Major Federal Program; Report on  
Internal Control over Compliance; and Report on Schedule of  

Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance 
 

Independent Auditor’s Report

Report on Compliance for the Major Federal Program 

We have audited The Comanche County Hospital Authority’s (Authority) compliance with the types of 
compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and 
material effect on its major federal program for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The Authority’s major 
federal program is identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of 
findings and questioned costs. 

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the federal statutes, regulations and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for the Authority’s major federal program 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Authority’s 
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in 
the circumstances.   

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for the major federal 
program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Authority’s compliance.

Opinion on the Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the Authority complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program 
for the year ended June 30, 2018.   

Report on Internal Control over Compliance  

Management of the Authority is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control 
over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, we considered the Authority’s internal control over compliance with 
the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on compliance for the major federal program and to test and report on internal control over 
compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 
Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance 

We have audited the financial statements of the Authority as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
issued our report thereon dated January 10, 2019, which contained an unmodified opinion on those 
financial statements and an Emphasis of Matter paragraph regarding a change in accounting principles.  
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.  
The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional 
analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the financial statements.  Such 
information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements.  The information has 
been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements 
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America.  In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly 
stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.
