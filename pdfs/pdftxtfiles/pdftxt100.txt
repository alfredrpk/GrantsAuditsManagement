INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors
Rosebud Grove, Inc.
Hobart, Oklahoma

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Rosebud Grove, Inc. (a nonprofit
organization), HUD Project No.118-HD029, as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of activities
and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for
our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Rosebud Grove, Inc. as of June 30, 2018, and the changes in its net assets and its



Page 2

cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

Other Matters

Other Information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
The accompanying supplementary information shown on pages 10 to 18 is presented for purposes of
additional analysis as required by the Consolidated Audit Guide for Audits of HUD Programs issued by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of the Inspector General, and is not a
required part of the financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards,
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is presented for purposes of
additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the
responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and
other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including
comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used
to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In
our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements
as a whole.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards we have also issued our report dated September 8,
2018, on our consideration of the internal control over financial reporting of Rosebud Grove, Inc. and on
our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements
and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control
over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing and not to provide an opinion on the
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the internal control over
financial reporting and compliance of Rosebud Grove, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 30, 2018

NOTE 1- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION

Rosebud Grove, Inc. is a non-profit corporation organized to provide affordable, quality housing
to developmentally disabled adults in the Hobart, Oklahoma area. Rosebud Grove, Inc. operates a 14-unit
housing projects (group homes) for the developmentally disabled. The apartment complex (14 units) is
organized under Section 811 of the National Affordable Housing Act. Such projects are regulated by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as to construction costs, rent charges and
operating methods. The Section 811 Capital Advance is the only major HUD Program. The Organization
was incorporated January 5, 2004, but the houses were not occupied until January 2007.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Rosebud Grove, Inc. reports information
regarding its financial position and changes in net assets according to three classes of net assets, based on
the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions, as follows:

Unrestricted - expendable amounts available for use without restriction.

Temporarily Restricted - amounts which have been temporarily restricted by donors or grantors
for specific purposes or time periods.

Permanently Restricted - amounts restricted by donors or grantors to be maintained in perpetuity
with income generated by such amounts available for expenditure, if applicable.

ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statement. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is at least reasonably possible that the
significant estimates used will change within the next year.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Rosebud Grove, Inc. considers highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or
less to be cash equivalents.



Page 7

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Purchased assets are recorded at cost, and donated assets are recorded at market value at the time of
donation. Property and equipment with initial values of $1,000 or more are capitalized and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.

INCOME TAXES

Rosebud Grove, Inc. is an exempt organization under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code Section
501(c)(3) and is not classified as a private foundation within the meaning of IRS Code Section 509(a).
Therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements for income taxes. The Organization is
subject to review by tax authorities. It is not currently under review. The open years are 2015 through 2018.

CONTRIBUTIONS

Gifts of cash and other assets are reported as restricted support if they are received with donor
stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When a donor restriction expires, temporarily-
restricted net assets are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the statement of activities as
net assets released from restrictions. Rosebud Grove, Inc. reports gifts of land, buildings and equipment as
unrestricted support unless explicit donor stipulations specify how the donated assets must be used. Gifts
of long-lived assets with explicit restrictions that specify how the assets are to be used and gifts of cash or
other assets that must be used to acquire long-lived assets are reported as restricted support.

Contributed materials are recorded at market value at the time of donation, and contributed services
are recorded at the fair value of the services, provided they meet the following criteria:

 Create or enhance non-financial assets; or

 Require specialized skills, are provided by individuals possessing those skills and would typically
be purchased if not provided by donation.

NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT RISK

Rosebud Grove, Inc. receives a significant amount of its support from the federal and state
government. A significant reduction in the level of this support, if this were to occur, may have a
significant adverse effect on South Central Housing Inc.'s programs.

NOTE 3 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent events have been evaluated through September 8, 2018, which is the date the
financial statements were available to be issued.

NOTE 4 — HUD PROGRAM FOOTNOTES

The following footnote disclosures are related only to the HUD Project:

(A) DISTRIBUTIONS - The Project's regulatory agreement with HUD stipulates, among other things,
that the Project will not make distributions of assets or income to any of its officers or directors.



Page 8

(B) TENANT SECURITY DEPOSITS - Tenant security deposits are held in a separate account in the
name of the Project. At June 30, 2018, the cash set aside in the separate bank account equals the
security deposit liability account.

(C) REPLACEMENT RESERVE DEPOSITS - A monthly deposit of $268.75 is required to be paid
into a separate escrow fund for replacement of major items. Withdrawals from this escrow can be
made only with HUD approval. The balance in the account at year end 2018 was $20,536.

(D) RESIDUAL RECEIPTS ACCOUNT - Use of the residual receipts account is contingent upon
HUD's prior written approval. The balance in the account at year end 2018 was $-0-.

(E) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment at June 30, 2018 is summarized as
follows:

Land $ 14,000

Buildings & Improvements 927,132

Furniture & Fixtures 18,358

Office Equipment 935

Totals $ 960,425

All property and equipment are pledged as collateral for the capital advance (Note F).

(F) CAPITAL ADVANCE - HUD made capital advances of $929,600 to the Corporation during
2006 to purchase the land and construct the apartment building. This advance is secured by a
mortgage on all property and all funds received by the Project. The advance bears no interest
and requires no repayment so long as the housing remains available for no less than forty years
for very low-income individuals with disabilities.

(G) REGULATORY AGREEMENT - Certain agreements are in effect between the Corporation and
HUD which regulate the activities of the Project. HUD makes housing assistance payments on
behalf of qualified individuals and families; these rent supplement payments amounted to
$26,065 during the year ended June 30, 2018. To ensure the Project remains well maintained and
managed, HUD imposes certain restrictions upon the Corporation. These restrictions included
tenant rental charges, maintenance, marketing, accounting and record keeping. The regulatory
agreement stipulates that the Project will not make distributions of assets or income to any of its
officers or directors. Under the regulatory agreement, the Project may not increase rents charged
to tenants without prior HUD approval.

The Project's major HUD program is the Section 811 Capital Advance. The Project's nonmajor
HUD program is the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program.

(H) MANAGEMENT FEE — Gorman Management Company, Inc. manages the property and
charges a fee of 9.48% of receipts.

(I) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying
amounts of cash equals its fair value. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the long-
term debt because of the unique nature of the Project and its dependence on the HUD housing
assistance payments.



Page 9

(J) CURRENT VULNERABILITY DUE TO CERTAIN CONCENTRATIONS - The Project's
sole operating asset is a 14-unit apartment project. The Project's operations are concentrated in
the multifamily real estate market. In addition, the Project operates in a heavily regulated
environment. The operations of the Project are subject to the administrative directives, rules
and regulations of federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to,
HUD. Such administrative directives, rules and regulations are subject to acts of Congress and
administrative changes mandated by HUD. Such changes may occur with little notice or
inadequate funding to pay for the related costs, including the additional administrative burden,
to comply with changes.

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE
AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED

IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

Independent Auditor’s Report

To the Board of Directors
Rosebud Grove, Inc.
Hobart, Oklahoma

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Rosebud Grove, Inc.,
HUD Project No. 118-HD029, which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2018,
and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the
financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated September 8, 2018.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the internal control over
financial reporting (internal control) of Rosebud Grove, Inc., to determine the audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of the effectiveness of the internal control of Rosebud Grove,
Inc.. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of Rosebud
Grove, Inc..

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less
severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with
governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses
may exist that have not been identified.



Page 21

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of Rosebud Grove, Inc.
are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have direct and material
effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on
compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed instances of noncompliance or other matters that are
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

Purpose of this Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance.
Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM

GUIDANCE

To the Board of Directors
Rosebud Grove, Inc.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

We have audited the compliance of Rosebud Grove, Inc., HUD Project No. 118-HD029, with the types of
compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material
effect on each of the major federal programs of Rosebud Grove, Inc., for the year ended June 30, 2018.
Rosebud Grove, Inc.’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section
of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs

Management’s Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Rosebud Grove, Inc.’s major federal
programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted
our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued
by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect
on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about
Rosebud Grove, Inc.’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal
program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination on the compliance of Rosebud Grove,
Inc.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In our opinion, Rosebud Grove, Inc., complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of Rosebud Grove, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal
control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and
performing our audit of compliance, we considered Rosebud Grove, Inc.’s internal control over
compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major
federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not
express an opinion on the effectiveness of Rosebud Grove, Inc.’s internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency,
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance such that there is a reasonable possibility
that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be
prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over
compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type
of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal
control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance
that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal
control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may
exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT’S REPORT ON APPLYING AGREED-UPON PROCEDURE

We have performed the procedure described in the second paragraph of this report, which was agreed to

Housing-Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC), solely to assist them in determining whether the
electronic submission of certain information agrees with the related hard copy documents included within

completeness of the electronic submission. This agreed-upon procedure engagement was conducted in
accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and the standards applicable to attestation engagements contained in Government Auditing
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The sufficiency of the procedure is
solely the responsibility of those parties specified in this report. Consequently, we make no representation

We compared the electronic submission of the items listed in the “UFRS Rule Information” column with

This agreed-upon procedure engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the standards applicable to

of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively, on whether the electronic
submission of the items listed in the “UFRS Rule Information” column agrees with the related hard copy
documents within the audit reporting package. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or
conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that
would have been reported to you.

We were engaged to perform an audit in accordance with the OMB Uniform Administrative Requirements,
Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (OMB Uniform Guidance), by Rosebud
