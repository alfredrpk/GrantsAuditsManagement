INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Honorable Board of Education
Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2
Caddo County, Oklahoma

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, 
the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund 
information of the Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2, Caddo County, 
Oklahoma as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements 
as listed in the table of contents.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluation the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our audit opinions.



Opinions

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business type 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Caddo/Kiowa 
Technology Center School District No. 2, at June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in 
financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Other Matters-Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that 
management’s discussion and analysis, pension plan funding progress, and budgetary 
comparison information be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such 
information, although not a part of the basic financial statement, is required by the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of the 
financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, 
economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the 
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally 
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management 
about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for 
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, 
and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We 
do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the 
limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or 
provide any assurance.

Other Information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements 
that collectively comprise the District’s financial statements. The fund financial 
statements-statutory basis and schedules listed in the Table of Contents are presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial 
statements. Also, the accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is 
presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and is also not a required part of 
the financial statements.

The fund financial statements-statutory basis and schedules and the schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of management and were derived 
from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional 
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statement or 
to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. 
In our opinion, the fund financial statements-statutory basis and schedules and the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards are fairly stated, in all material respects, in 
relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.



In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated 
on December 5, 2018, our consideration of the Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center’s internal 
control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of 
laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that 
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal 
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit 
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards, and should be considered 
in assessing the results of our audit.

Management's Discussion and Analysis 

Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2018

Caddo Kiowa Technology Center provides this discussion and analysis of the District's financial activities 
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The intent of this narrative overview is to look at the District's 
financial performance as a whole, and readers are encouraged to consider the notes to the basic financial 
statements and the financial statements to enhance their understanding of Caddo Kiowa Technology 
Center’s financial performance.

FUND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

This annual report consists of a series of financial statements. The government-wide statements include 
the Statement of Net Assets and Statement of Activities, which provide information about the activities 
of the whole District, presenting both an aggregate view of the District's finances and a long-term view of 
those finances. The District uses three funds to account for its financial transactions. A fund is a grouping 
of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific 
activities or objectives. The District uses fund accounting to insure and demonstrate compliance with 
financial-related legal requirements. The fund financial statements focus on the individual parts of the 
District's operations in more detail than govemment-wide financial statements. Because the focus of 
District funds is narrower than that of the governmental-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare 
the information presented for District funds with similar information presented for District activities in 
the govemment-wide financial statements. Both the District's fund balance statement and the District's 
fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate 
this comparison between funds and activities of each.

Funds are classified into two categories: governmental and fiduciary, with each category divided into 
separate "fund types". Governmental funds include the General Fund and the Building Fund. Fiduciary 
funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, or on behalf of other funds within 
the District and include, but are not limited to, the school activity fund.

GENERAL FUND HIGHLIGHTS

The General Fund represents the District's major or significant fund. At the close of fiscal year 2018, the 
District is able to report positive cash balance in all funds, with the General Fund balance being 
$2,095,991. Because of some continual decline in the economic indicators in the State and nation, the 
District is making appropriate adjustments to reflect this decline and expects to maintain an adequate and 
appropriate fund balance at the end of the 2018 fiscal year.

FUTURE ECONOMIC FACTORS

Caddo Kiowa Technology Center remains in a very good financial condition. However, future finances are not 
without challenges, and they will be impacted significantly by both State and local economic conditions. On a 
positive side, the District’s local ad valorem assessed valuation should increase along with future residential 
and commercial growth.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

The Honorable Board of Education
Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2
Caddo County, Oklahoma

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the 
Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively 
comprise the District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon 
dated December 5, 2018.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit, we considered the District’s internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the 
financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control, over financial reporting.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not 
allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material 
weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by 
those charged with governance.



Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose 
described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all 
deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies 
in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial 
statements are free of material misstatement; we performed tests of its compliance with 
certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance 
with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions 
was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that 
are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

Purpose of This Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal 
control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Governmental Auditing Standards 
in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this 
communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE 
FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL 

CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY 
THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

The Honorable Board of Education
Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center, School District No. 2
Caddo County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

We have audited the Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2, Caddo 
County, Oklahoma’s, compliance with the types of compliance requirements described 
in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on 
each of the District's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results 
section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

Management’s Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grants applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major 
federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred 
to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America: the standards applicable to financial 
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General 
of the United States; and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (The Uniform Guidance.) Those standards and the 
Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the 
District’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as 
we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for 
each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination 
of the District’s compliance.



Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In our opinion, Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2 complied, in all 
material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that 
could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2 is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of 
compliance, we considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types 
of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal 
program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program 
and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 
Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a 
control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal 
course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely 
basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a 
timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by 
those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose 
described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the 
scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing 
based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not 
suitable for any other purpose.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The government-wide financial statements of the Caddo/Kiowa Technology 
Center School District No. 2 (the "District") have been prepared in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles. However, the other 
supplementary information has prepared in accordance with a statutory basis 
prescribed by the State Department of Education, which is a comprehensive 
basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles. The 
more significant of the District's accounting policies are described below.

Reporting Entity

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes and, accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and 
financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the public school system of 
Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of 
Education and is financially dependent on support from the State of Oklahoma. 
The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma 
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected 
members. The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

In evaluating how to define the district for financial reporting purposes, 
management has considered all potential component units. The decision to 
include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was made by applying 
the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB). The basic --but not the only --criterion for including a potential 
component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body's ability to 
exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this ability 
is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise 
oversight responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing 
authority, the designation of management, the ability to significantly influence 
operations and accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in 
evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. Application 
of this criterion involves considering whether the activity benefits the District 
and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted within the geographic 
boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. A third 
criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion 
from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships, 
regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities. 
Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component 
units included in the District's reporting entity.

B. Basic Financial Statements 

New Reporting Standard

In June 1999, the GASB issued Statement No.34 "Basic Financial Statements 
and Management's Discussion and Analysis for State and Local Government." 
This statement establishes new financial reporting requirements for state and 
local governments throughout the United States. It creates new information 
and restructures much of the information that governments have presented in the 
past. Comparability with reports issued in all prior years is affected. The District 
is required to implement this standard for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.

The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net assets and 
the statement of activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities 
of the primary government. For the most part, the effect of inter-fund activity has 
been removed from these statements. Governmental activities are normally 
supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues.

The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses 
of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses 
are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function. Program revenues 
include: (1) tuition or fees paid by student or citizens of the District, and (2) grants 
and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital 
requirements of a particular function. Taxes and other items, including state aid, 
that are not properly included among program revenues are reported as general 
revenues.

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary, and
fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided into separate "fund types."

Governmental Fund Types

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's 
general activities, including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies 
(special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets 
(capital projects funds) and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service 
funds).

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue 
sources include state and local property taxes and state funding under the 
Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures include all costs 
associated with the daily operations of the schools except construction and debt 
service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal 
and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018



Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - continued

B. Basic Financial Statements - continued

Special Revenue Funds - The special revenue funds include the District's 
Building Fund. The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property 
taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling or repairing buildings 
and for purchasing furniture and equipment.

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is normally the District's Sinking Fund 
and is used to account for the accumulation of financial resources for the 
payment of general long-term debt principal, interest and related costs. The 
primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt 
service and interest earnings from temporary investments.

Capital Projects Funds - The capital projects funds are normally the District's 
Bond Funds and are used to account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used 
exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school 
facilities, renovating existing facilities and acquiring transportation equipment.

Proprietary Fund Types

Proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in the 
private sector, where the determination of net income is necessary or useful to 
sound financial administration. Goods or services from such activities can be 
provided either to outside parties (enterprise funds) or to other departments or 
agencies primarily within the District (internal service funds). The District did not 
maintain any proprietary funds during the year under review.

Fiduciary Fund Types

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, 
including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. 
When these assets are held under the terms of a formal trust agreement, either a 
nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund is used. The terms 
"nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to whether or not the District is under an 
obligation to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to 
account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do 
not involve measurement of results of operations.

Trust and Aaencv Funds - The trust and agency funds group includes the School 
Activities Funds which are maintained at various sites throughout the District. 
The School Activities Funds are used to account for monies collected principally 
through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The 
administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, 
disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.

Account Groups

GASB Statement No. 34 eliminates the presentation of account groups, but 
provides for these records to be maintained and incorporates the information into 
the governmental column in the government-wide statement of net assets.

Memorandum Only - Total Column
The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned 
"memorandum only" to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial 
analysis. Data in this column does not present financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles. Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. Interfund 
eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data.

C. Basis of Accounting

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in 
the accounts and reported in the financial statements. Basis of accounting 
relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measurement 
focus applied.

In the other supplemental information section, all governmental and expendable 
trust funds are accounted for using the Statutory basis of accounting. Revenues 
are recognized when they are received rather than earned under this method of 
accounting. Also, under the Statutory basis of accounting, expenditures are 
generally recognized when encumbered or reserved rather than at the time the 
related fund liability is incurred.

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary 
budget must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the 
fiscal year beginning the following July 1. If the preliminary budget requires an 
additional levy, the District must hold an election on the first Tuesday in February 
to approve the levy. If the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, 
it becomes the legal budget. If an election is held and the taxes are approved, 
then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. If voters reject the 
additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting (continued)

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund and 
Special Revenue Funds that includes revenues and expenditures. The budget is 
prepared on the same basis of accounting as the financial statements. All 
appropriations lapse at the end of each fiscal year.

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for 
goods or services. Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders and 
other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the applicable 
fund, is utilized in all governmental funds of the District.

E. Assets. Liabilities and Fund Balance

Cash and Cash Eguivalents - For the purpose of the financial statements, the 
District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid 
investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to 
be cash and cash equivalents.

Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States 
Government and Agencies with maturities greater than three months when 
purchased. All investments are recorded at cost, which approximates market 
value.

Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property 
taxes which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the 
District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from 
the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to 
the county treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence 
tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes 
is due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1.

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable 
on January 2. The second half of the taxes becomes delinquent on April 1 of the 
year following the year of assessment. If not paid by the following October 1, the 
property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two 
years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end 
of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the 
property.

E. Assets. Liabilities and Fund Balance (continued)

Inventories - Supply inventories are not presented in the financial statements 
and are not included in determining the District's fund balances in accordance 
with the Statutory basis of accounting.

Fixed Assets and Property. Plant and Equipment The capital assets for the 
year ended June 30, 2018 are as follows:

Beginning Ending
Balance Increases Decreases Balance

Capital Assets $11,718,459 79,945 (39,213) 11,759,191

$ 3.517.979 ( 198.953) (39.213) 3.279.813

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental 
fund when due or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service 
fund for payment early in the following year. For other long-term obligations, 
only that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial 
resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining 
portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term debt account 
group. Long-term liabilities expected to be financed from proprietary fund 
operations are accounted for in those funds.

Fund Balance - Fund Balance represents the funds not encumbered by 
purchase order, legal contracts or outstanding warrants.

F. Revenue, Expenses and Expenditures

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are 
primarily governed by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, 
Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the 
allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated 
from the districts.

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State 
Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of 
money for prior years' errors disclosed by review. Normally, such adjustments 
are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the 
adjustment was made.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

F. Revenue. Expenses and Expenditures (continued)

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical 
educational programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue 
earmarked for these programs be expended only for the program for which the 
money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of 
the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the 
same categorical programs. The State Department of Education requires that 
categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund.

Inter-fund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as 
revenues, expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute 
reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that 
are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses 
in the fund that is reimbursed.

All other inter-fund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and 
reimbursements, are reported as transfers. Nonrecurring or non-routine 
permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. All other 
inter-fund transfers are reported as operating transfers. There were no 
operating transfers or residual equity transfers during fiscal year 2018.

2. Deposits and Investment Risks

Custodial Credit Risk - The District’s policy as it relates to custodial credit risk 
is to secure its uninsured deposits with collateral, valued at no more than 
market value, at least at a level of 100 percent of the uninsured deposits and 
accrued interest thereon. The investment policy and state law also limits 
acceptable collateral to U.S. Treasury and agency securities and direct debt 
obligations of the state, municipalities, counties, and school districts in the 
state of Oklahoma, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As required by Federal 
12 U.S.C.A., Section 1823(e), all financial institutions pledging collateral to the 
District must have a written collateral agreement approved by the board of 
directors or loan committee.

At June 30, 2018, the District was not exposed to custodial credit risk as defined 
above.

Investment Credit Risk -  The District’s investment policy limits investments to 
those allowed in state law applicable to school districts as follows:

a. Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities 
to which the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government is pledged, or 
obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the State is 
pledged.



CADDO/KIOWA TECHNOLOGY CENTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

2. Deposits and Investment Risks (continued)

b. Certificates of deposit or savings accounts that are either insured or secured 
with acceptable collateral with in-state financial institutions, and fully insured 
certificates of deposit or savings accounts in out-of-state financial institutions.

Investment Credit Risk (continued) - Investment credit risk is the risk that an 
issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The 
District has no formal policy limiting investments based on credit rating, but 
discloses any such credit risk associated with their investments. Unless there is 
information to the contrary, obligations of the U.S. government or obligations 
explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government are not considered to have credit 
risk and do not require disclosure of credit quality.

Investment Interest Rate Risk -  Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in 
interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The District’s 
investment policy limits investments to those with a short-term maturities, as a 
means of managing exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest 
rates. The District discloses it exposure to interest rate risk by disclosing the 
maturity dates of its various investments.

Concentration of Investment Credit R isk- Exposure to concentration of credit 
risk is considered to exist when investments in any one issuer represent a 
significant percent of total investments of the District (any over 5 percent are 
disclosed). Investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government 
and investments in mutual funds, external investment pools, and other pooled 
investments are excluded from this consideration. The District’s investment 
policy requires diversification of investments.

At June 30, 2018, the District had no concentration of credit risk as defined 
above.

3. General Long-Term Debt

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount 
exceeding the revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the 
District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by the voters and issued by 
the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be 
fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue.

General long-term debt of the District normally consists of bonds payable and 
related interest. The District had no other long-term debt for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, other than obligations which existed under lease purchase 
contracts. In accordance with Oklahoma law, lease purchase agreements and 
other contracts must be affirmed in each subsequent fiscal year in order to 
emain in effect.

Retirement Plan -  Oklahoma Teacher's Retirement System (OTRS) 

Plan Description

The District as the employer, participates in the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement Plan— 
a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the 
Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). Title 70 O.S. Sec. 17-105 defines all 
retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with 
the State Legislature. OTRS issues a publicly available financial report that can be 
obtained at www.ok.gov/OTRS.

Benefits Provided:

OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to members of the plan.

Benefit provisions include:

■ Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after 
five years of credited Oklahoma service. Members who joined the System 
on June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire at maximum benefits when 
age and years of creditable service total 80. Members joining the System 
after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their age and 
years of creditable service total 90. Members whose age and service do 
not equal the eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as early as age 
55, and at age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on their years of 
service. The maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2% of final 
compensation for each year of credited service.

■ Final compensation for members who joined the System prior to July 1, 
1992 is defined as the average salary for the three highest years of 
compensation. Final compensation for members joining the System after 
June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive 
years of annual compensation in which contributions have been made. 
The final average compensation is limited for service credit accumulated 
prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, depending on the member’s 
election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits 
accumulated after June 30, 1995 are calculated based on each member’s 
final average compensation. Upon the death of a member who has not yet 
retired, the designated beneficiary shall receive the member’s total 
contributions plus 100% of interest earned through the end of the fiscal 
year, with interest rates varying based on time of service. A surviving 
spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, in lieu of the 
aforementioned benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled 
to at the time of death as provided under the Joint Survivor Benefit Option.

Oklahoma Statute, as amended by the Oklahoma Legislature, and are not based on 
actuarial calculations. Employees are required to contribute 7% percent of their annual 
pay. Participating employers are required to contribute 9.5% of the employees’ annual 
pay and an additional 7.7% for any employees’ salaries covered by federal funds. 
Contributions to the pension plan from the District were $389,279.

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, Deferred Outflows of Resources, and 
Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions

At June 30, 2018, the District reported a liability of $7,712,119 for its proportionate 
share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 
2017, and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017. The District’s proportion of 
the net pension liability was based on the District’s contributions received by the 
pension plan relative to the total contributions received by pension plan for all 
participating employers as of June 30, 2017. Based upon this information, the District’s 
proportion was 0.11647411%.

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District recognized pension expense of 
$315,783. At June 30, 2018, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and 
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

30, 2017. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on 
pension plan investments of 7.5%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection 
of cash flows, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were 
projected to be available to finance all projected future benefit payments of current plan 
members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the 
total pension liability. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single 
discount rate assumed that plan member and employer contributions will be made at 
the current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of payrolls. The projection of 
cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the matching contributions 
will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five years 
of actual contributions.

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate

The following presents the net pension liability of the employers calculated using the 
discount rate of 7.5%, as well as what the Plan’s net pension liability would be if it were 
calculated using a discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower (6.5%) or 1 percentage 
point higher (8.5%) than the current rate:

1% Decrease Current Discount 1% Increase
6.5% Rate 7.5%__________ 8.5%

Employers’ net pension liability $ 10,971,734 $7,712,119 $ 5,276,208

Pension plan fiduciary net position

Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the 
separately issued financial report of the OTRS; which can be located at 
www.ok.gov/OTRS.

CADDO/KIOWA TECHNOLOGY CENTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 2
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

5. Risk Management and Litigation

The District is exposed to various risks of losses related to torts; theft of, 
damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to 
employees; and natural disasters. Therefore, insurance coverage is obtained 
from various insurance carriers.

Management estimates that the amount of actual or potential claims against the 
District as of June 30, 2018, will not materially affect the financial condition of the 
District. Therefore, none of the Districts funds contain any provisions for these 
types of losses.

6. Contingencies

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and 
adjustment by grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts 
already collected, may constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, 
if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be 
determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be 
immaterial.

7. Subsequent Events

Subsequent events have been evaluated through December 5, 2018, which is 
the date the financial statements were issued.

The Honorable Board of Education
Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School District No. 2
Caddo County, Oklahoma

We have audited the financial statements of Caddo/Kiowa Technology Center School 
District No. 2, Caddo County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, as 
listed in the table of contents, and have issued our report thereon dated December 5, 
2018. As a part of our audit, we made a study and evaluation of the District's system of 
internal accounting control to the extent we considered necessary solely to determine the 
nature, timing and extent of our auditing procedures. Our study and evaluation was more 
limited than would be necessary to express an opinion on the system of internal 
accounting control taken as a whole, and we do not express such an opinion.

However, during our audit we became aware of some matters that, while not involving 
material weaknesses in internal accounting control, are opportunities for strengthening 
internal controls and operating efficiency. The memorandum that accompanies this letter 
summarizes our comments and suggestions regarding those matters. This letter does not 
affect our report dated December 5, 2018, on the financial statements of Caddo/Kiowa 
Technology Center School District No. 2.

We will review the status of these comments during our next audit engagement. We would 
be pleased to discuss these comments in further detail at your convenience, to perform 
any additional study of these matters or to assist you in implementing the 
recommendations.

We also wish to express our appreciation of the courteous attention and cooperation which 
we received from staff members during our engagement.

Sincerely,

PUTNAM & COMPANY, PLLC
