The Honorable Board of Education 
Noble School District No. 1-40 
Cleveland County, Oklahoma 

Report on Financial Statements 

Independent Auditor's Report 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements - regulatory 
basis of the Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with financial reporting provisions prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted 
my audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amount and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
qualified audit opinion. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note 1 (C) to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by the Noble 
School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1 (C) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, 
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse Opinion on 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraphs, the financial statements referred to in the first 
paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, the financial position of Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma as 
of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in financial position for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not include the general fixed asset account 
group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset 
account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on 
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, 
Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for 
the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in the Note 1 (C). 

Other Matters 
Other Information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial 
statements within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-regulatory basis, 
and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under supplementary information, are presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined financial statements of the 
District. The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis 
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards and/or the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The combining financial statements-regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, 
under supplementary information and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting 
records used to prepare the combined financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the 
combined financial statements, and other additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the combined financial 
statements, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America. In my opinion, the supplementary information including the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined 
financial statements taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 (C). 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated February 13, 
2019, on my consideration of Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma's internal control 
over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not 
to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be 
considered in assessing the results of my audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



NOBLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-40 
CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS
 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying financial statements of the Noble School District N
o. 1-40 (the "District") conform to the 

regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive bas
is of accounting prescribed by the 

Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the syste
m of accounting authorized by the 

State of Oklahoma. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statem
ents are not intended to present 

financial position and results of operations in conformity with account
ing principles generally accepted in 

the United States of America. The District's accounting policies are d
escribed in the following notes that 

are an integral part of the District's financial statements. 

A Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Titl
e 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and, 

accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting p
urposes. The District is part of the 

public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and con
trol of the State Board of Education 

and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma. The genera
l operating authority for the public 

school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Okla
homa Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education com
posed of elected members. The 

appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purpose
s, management has considered all 

potential component units. The decision to include a potential compo
nent unit in the reporting entity was 

made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accoun
ting Standards Board (GASB). The 

basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component 
unit within the reporting entity is the 

governing body's ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The m
ost significant manifestation of this 

ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability
 to exercise oversight responsibility 

include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, th
e designation of management, the 

ability to significantly influence operations, and accountability for fiscal 
matters. A second criterion used in 

evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. 
Application of this criterion involves 

considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, 
or whether the activity is conducted 

within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally avail
able to its patrons. A third criterion 

used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusi
on from the reporting entity is the 

existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether the 
District is able to exercise oversight 

responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there 
are no potential component units 

included in the District's reporting entity. These statements present onl
y the activities of the District. 

B. Measurement Focus 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its finan
cial position and the results of its 

operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal 
compliance and to aid financial 

management by segregating transactions related to certain district func
tions or activities. 

A fund is an independent accounting entity with a self-balancing set of
 accounts. The account groups are 

financial reporting devices designed to provide accountability for certa
in assets and liabilities that are not 

recorded directly in the funds. 

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary a
nd fiduciary. Each category, in turn, 

is divided into separate "fund types." The District has the following fund
 types and account groups: 

Governmental Funds 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a governme
nt's general activities, including the 

collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue fu
nds), the acquisition or construction 

of general fixed assets (capital project funds), and the servicing of g
eneral long-term debt (debt service 

funds). Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measu
rements made, regardless of the 

measurement focus applied. All governmental type funds are ac
counted for using the Regulatory 

(Statutory) basis of accounting. All revenues from all sources, incl
uding property taxes, entitlements, 

grants, and shared revenues are recognized when they are received,
 rather than earned. Expenditures 

are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved, rather than
 at the time the related liability is 

incurred. Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when
 due and certain compensated 

absences and claims and judgments are recognized when the obligatio
ns are expected to be liquidated

CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

with expendable, available financial resources. Fiduciary type funds are accou
nted for using the cash 

basis of accounting. These practices differ from accounting principles generally
 accepted in the United 

States of America. 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions 
except those required to 

be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include local propert
y taxes and federal and 

state funding. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations 
of the schools, except for 

programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and de
bt service on bonds and 

other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricte
d monies that must be 

expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are used for proceeds of spec
ific revenue sources that 

are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property
 taxes levied for the 

purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings a
nd for purchasing 

furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for technology 
center property, for 

paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, 
for paying fire and 

casualty insurance premiums for center facilities, for purchasing security system
s, and for paying 

salaries of security personnel. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's sinking fund and is 
used to account for the 

accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt pr
incipal and interest. The 

primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt servi
ce and interest earnings 

from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's bond fund and i
s used to account for the 

proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constru
cting and equipping new 

school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipme
nt. 

Fiduciary Funds 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside 
parties, including other 

governments or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are
 held under the terms of 

a trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and reporting. Age
ncy funds generally are 

used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their a
gent and do not involve 

measurement of results of operations. 

Agency Funds - The agency fund is the school activities fund, which is used to 
account for monies, 

collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-spon
sored groups. The 

administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collectin
g, disbursing, and 

accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts
 used only to establish 

accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established
 to account for all 

long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt s
ervice fund and the 

amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal. 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for 
property, plant, and 

equipment of the school district. The District does not have the information neces
sary to include this 

group in its combined financial statements.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is pres
cribed by the Oklahoma 

State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accept
ed form of presentation 

used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statemen
t No. 34, Basic Financial 

Statements-Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Gove
rnments. This format 

significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash rec
eipts and disbursements 

modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department o
f Education (OSDE) as 

follows: 
• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitm

ents for 

the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure when the obligation is

 paid. 

• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group. Fixed
 assets are not 

depreciated. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally
 accepted in the United 

States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become a
vailable and measurable, 

or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when 
the related liabilities are 

incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

Prior to July 1 each year, the governing board of the school district prepares a ver
ified application showing 

the needs of the school district and submits the application to the County Ex
cise Board, who makes 

temporary appropriations for lawful current expenses of the school district. The t
emporary appropriations 

are merged with the annual appropriations when the annual budget for the 
school district is finally 

approved. 

Prior to October 1 each year, the school Board of Education must make a financia
l statement, showing the 

true fiscal condition of the school as of the close of the previous fiscal year ended
 June 30, along with an 

itemized statement of estimated needs and probable income from all sources for th
e fiscal year. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the general fund and s
pecial revenue fund(s) of 

the school district. 

Encumbrances represent commitments to unperformed contracts for goods or 
services. Encumbrance 

accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of reso
urces are recorded as 

expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the D
istrict. Under Oklahoma 

Law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of the year. 

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memo
randum only" to indicate 

that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column do
es not present financial 

position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepte
d accounting principles. 

Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund eliminations have
 not been made on the 

aggregation of this data. 

Cash - Cash consists of cash on hand, demand deposit accounts, and interest bea
ring checking accounts.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Investments - State statutes govern the District's investment policy. Permis
sible investments include 

direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates 
of deposit of savings and 

loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savi
ngs certificates of savings 

and loan associations, and trust companies. Collateral is required for demand d
eposits and certificates of 

deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit insurance. Investments ar
e stated at cost. 

Inventories - Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies h
eld for consumption. The 

value of consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District's financ
ial statements. The costs 

of inventories are recorded as expenditures when encumbered and purch
ased, rather than when 

consumed. 

Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expe
cted to be liquidated with 

expendable, available financial resources is reported as expenditure and
 a fund liability of the 

governmental fund that will pay it. There are no amounts of vested or accumula
ted vacation leave that are 

not expected to be liquidated with expendable, available financial resources.
 Vested or accumulated 

vacation leave of proprietary funds is recorded as an expense and liability of th
ose funds as the benefits 

accrue to employees. 

No liability is recorded for non-vesting accumulating rights to receive suc
h pay benefits. Vested 

accumulated rights to receive sick pay benefits have been reported in the gene
ral long-term debt account 

group since none of the vested sick leave is expected to be liquidated with expe
ndable, available financial 

resources. 

Fixed Assets - The District has not maintained a record of its general fixed a
ssets, and, accordingly, a 

General Fixed Asset Account Group is not included in the financial statemen
ts. General fixed assets 

purchased are recorded as expenditures in the various funds at the time of purch
ase. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmenta
l fund when due or when 

resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early 
in the following year. For 

other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expe
ndable, available financial 

resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining 
portion of such obligations 

is reported in the general long-term debt account group. 

Cash Fund Balance - Cash fund balance represents the funds not encumbered
 by purchase order, legal 

contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

F. Revenues, Expenses and Expenditures 

Local Revenues - Revenue from local sources is revenue produced within 
the school district, which 

includes ad valorem taxes. It is available for current educational expenses
 and for other purposes 

authorized by the school board. 

The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad 
valorem taxes on real and 

personal property within the District. The county assessor, upon receipt of the
 certification of tax levies 

from the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submiss
ion to the county treasurer 

prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fif
teen days of receipt of the 

tax rolls. The first half of the tax is due prior to January 1. The second half is du
e prior to April 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable o
n January 2. Second half 

taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessmen
t. If taxes are delinquent 

and unpaid for a period of three years or more the real estate may be sold for suc
h taxes. 

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is revenue fro
m funds collected by an 

intermediate administrative unit or political sub-division, such as a county or mun
icipality, and redistributed 

to the school district.

CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

State Revenues - Revenue from state sources for current operations are prim
arily governed by the state 

aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Stat
utes. The State Board of 

Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school distr
icts based on information 

accumulated from the districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the Sta
te Department of Education 

may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year e
rrors disclosed by review. 

Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of reve
nue of the year when the 

adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical e
ducational programs. State 

Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these program
s be expended only for the 

program for which the money is provided. These rules also require that the mo
ney not expended, as of the 

close of the fiscal year, be carried forward into the following year to be expend
ed for the same categorical 

programs. The State Department of Education requires that categorical educa
tional program revenues be 

accounted for in the general fund. 

Federal Revenues - Revenue from Federal sources is money originating from 
the Federal government and 

made available to the school district either as direct grants or under various pr
ograms passed-through the 

State Department of Education. 

The Federal government also makes payments to school districts whose reve
nues are adversely affected 

by the presence of Federal activities. Although these payments are made in c
onsideration of lost property 

tax revenue, the Oklahoma State Department of Education advocates cla
ssifying such amounts as 

revenue from Federal sources. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing
 directly with the interaction 

between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a s
chool classroom, in another 

location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning situations, such as 
those involving co curricular 

activities. It may also be provided through some other approved medium
, such as television, radio, 

telephone and correspondence. Examples of expenditures that might be inclu
ded here are the activities of 

teacher assistant of any type (clerks, graders, teaching machines, etc.), whic
h assist in the instructional 

process. The activities of tutors, translators, and interpreters would be re
corded here. Department 

chairpersons who teach for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/tran
sfer fees paid to other LEAs 

would be included here. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide admin
istrative, technical (such as 

guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance instructio
n. These services exist as 

adjuncts for fulfilling the objective of instruction, community services and enter
prise programs, rather than 

as entitles within them. 

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures - Activities conce
rned with providing non-

instructional services to students, staff, and the community. 

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures - Consist of 
activities involved with the 

acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of
 buildings and additions to 

buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in e
quipment; and improvement 

to sites. 

Other Outlays Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds ar
e not properly classified as 

expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These are c
lassified as Other Outlays. 

These include debt service payments (principal and interest). 

Other Uses Expenditures - This includes scholarships provided by private gift
s and endowments; student 

aid and staff awards supported by outside revenue sources (i.e., foundations). 
Also, expenditures for self-

funded employee benefit programs administered either by the District or a third 
party administrator. 

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/w
arrants issued to outside 

agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for ov
erpayments, non-qualified 

expenditures, and other refunds to be repaid from District funds.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

lnterfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as rev
enues, expenditures or 

expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures
/expenses initially made 

from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/e
xpenses in the fund that 

is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimburs
ements, are reported as 

transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are repo
rted as residual equity 

transfers. 

Budgetary Information 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal Estimate of Needs (Budget) is require
d for all funds except for 

trust and agency funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the origi
nally approved budgeted 

appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adju
sted for supplemental 

appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. The annual E
stimate of Needs, when 

approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approv
ed by the County Excise 

Board, becomes the legal budget. Supplemental appropriations, if required, wer
e made during the year 

and are reflected on the budget vs. actual presentations shown included in support
ing schedules. 

2. Deposit Categories of Credit Risk 

Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amoun
ts not covered by federal 

deposit insurance. The District's investment policies are governed by stat
e statute. Permissible 

investments include: 

1. Direct obligations of the United States Government to the payment of which t
he full faith and credit 

of the government is pledged. 

2. Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the state is pledg
ed. 

3. Certificates of deposits of banks when such certificates of deposits are se
cured by acceptable 

collateral as in the deposit of other public monies. 

4. Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations to
 the extent that such 

accounts or certificates are fully insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insuranc
e Corporation. 

5. Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral consisting of thos
e items specified in 

paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section including obligations of the United States, 
its agencies and 

instrumentalities, and where collateral has been deposited with a trustee of cust
odian bank in an 

irrevocable trust or escrow account established for such purposes. 

6. County, municipal or school district direct debt obligations for which an ad 
valorem tax may be 

levied or bond and revenue anticipation notes, money judgments against such co
unty, municipality 

or school district ordered by a court of record or bonds or bond and revenue 
anticipation notes 

issued by a public trust for which such county, municipality or school district is a b
eneficiary thereof. 

All collateral pledged to secure public funds shall be valued at no more than marke
t value. 

7. Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Co
mmission and which 

investments consist of obligations of the United States, its agencies and instr
umentalities, and 

investments in those items listed above. 

8. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district.

Deposit Categories of Credit Risk (continued) 

9. Qualified pooled investment programs, the investments of which consist of those item
s specified 

above, as well as obligations of the United States agencies and instrumentalities, regardless
 of the 

size of the district's budget. To be qualified, a pooled investment program for school funds m
ust be 

governed through an lnterlocal cooperative agreement formed pursuant to Title 70 Section 5
-117b, 

and the program must competitively select its investment advisors and other professionals
. Any 

pooled investment program must be approved by the Board of Education. 

The District's investment policy instructs the treasurer to place primary emphasis on safety a
nd liquidity in 

the investment of funds. All investments shall be designed to maximize yield with the class
 of investment 

instrument, consistent with the safety of the funds invested. 

Custodial Credit Risk: 

Deposits and Investments - The District's demand deposits are required by law to be collate
ralized by the 

amount that is not federally insured. 

Securities pledged as collateral are held by a third party or Federal Reserve Bank. 
Joint custody 

safekeeping receipts are held in the name of the depositing institution, but are pledged to the
 District. The 

security cannot be released, substituted, or sold without the School Treasurer's approval a
nd release of 

the security. 

Certificates of deposit are collateralized at least by the amount not federally insured. As of J
une 30, 2018, 

the District had no deposits exposed to custodial credit risk. 

Interest Rate Risk: 

Investments are made based upon prevailing market conditions at the time of the transa
ction with the 

intent to hold the instrument until maturity. However, the District has no formal written poli
cy addressing 

interest rate risk. 

Credit Risk: 

The District has no formal written policy addressing credit risk. 

At June 30, 2018, the District has no investments that are not guaranteed by the full faith an
d credit of the 

United States Government. 

3. General long-Term Debt 

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the r
evenue to be 

received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been
 approved by 

the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are r
equired to be 

fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. 

General long-term debt of the District includes bonds payable and capital leases payable. 
Debt service 

requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and future revenues of the deb
t service fund. 

Capital leases are paid from the District's capital projects fund.

General Long-Term Debt (continued) 

Bond/Lease-Purchase Financing 

The Constitution of the State of Oklahoma, Article 10, Section 26, prohibits a school district from incurring 

indebtedness exceeding 10% of the valuation of the taxable property within the school district, including 

existing indebtedness. 

The Oklahoma Attorney General has opined that it is possible for the voters of a school district to vote to 

authorize indebtedness in amounts which exceeds the constitutional limits of bonded indebtedness, and 

subsequently issue bonds in separate amounts such that each issuance is in compliance with· limits 

allowed by law. The limitation, according to the Attorney General, is stated in terms of incurring 

indebtedness without specifically limiting the amount of debt which the voters may approve. 

Once the voters have approved the issuance of the bonds, the school district then sells and issues the 

bonds in series (a portion of the overall bonds authorized by the voters). As one series of bonds are 

retired, the district's constitutional indebtedness allows more bonds to be issued and another series of 

bonds can be sold. 

On the 241h day of August, 2010, the voters of Noble School District authorized the issuance of 

$22, 710,000.00 of building bonds for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, and equipping school facilities. 

The bonds were to be issued in series over a period of years so that at no time the total bonds outstanding 

would exceed the amount allowed under the Constitution of Oklahoma. 

In order for Noble School District to complete all projects to be financed by the 2010 building bonds in the 

shortest time possible and possibly save money by avoiding rising construction costs, the district entered 

into lease financing with a third-party, Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. for the express purpose of 

providing capital financing to the school district. The third-party financer (Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, 

Inc. a not for profit corporation, organized under Oklahoma Law) issues conduit debt obligations (limited-

obligation revenue bonds or similar debt instruments) to provide funds for the school district. The not-for-

pr0fit corporation has no obligation for such debt beyond the resources provided by a lease or lease 

purchase with the school district, on whose behalf the debt is issued. 

The district entered into lease-purchase agreements with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. on April 1, 

2011 in the amounts of $18,375,000.00 amortized with principal and interest amounts designed to coincide 

with periodic issuance of series of the $22,710,000.00 of building bonds authorized by Noble School 

District voters on August 24, 2010. The district planned to use the proceeds of these general obligation 

bonds to finance the installments of the lease financing obligations. The proceeds provided by the lease 

financing would be used to complete the projects approved by the voters when the bonds were authorized. 

The lease-purchase agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc., was structured so that as the 

lease-purchase principal and interest payments become due, the district would be able to sell series of the 

August 201 O bonds in amounts that would coincide with the lease-purchase obligations, however the sale 

of those bonds, including existing indebtedness must not exceed the district's constitutional debt limit. The 

district had principal and interest obligations of $4,499, 105.00 due August 15, 2017 under the lease-

purchase agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc., however, the district's constitutional debt 

limit prohibited issuing another series of bonds in amounts sufficient to cover the principal and interest 

payments. 

On March 7, 2017, the district held another election and voters approved the authorization of 

$30,010,000.00 of additional building bonds and $1,000,000.00 of transportation equipment bonds. 

On August 1, 2017, the district entered into additional bond/lease financing with Cleveland County 

Educational Facilities Authority, a public trust organized under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. This 

bond/lease financing in the total amount of $28,605,000.00 was to be used to 1) Payoff the remaining 

balance of the 2011 lease financing with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. ($12,520,307.67) and 2) The 

remainder to be used for additional construction of improvements to school district building facilities.

The District participates in the state-administrated Teacher's Retirement System of Oklahoma (the 

"system"), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system. The supervising 

authority for the management and operation of the System is a 13-member Board of Trustees, which acts 

as a fiduciary for investment of the funds and the application of plan interpretations. The System provides 

retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments, death. benefits and other benefits to 

plan members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statutes establish benefit provisions and may be 

amended only through legislative action. The District has no responsibility or authority for the operation 

and administration of the system nor has it any liability, except for contribution requirements. The 

Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial 

statements and required supplementary information for the System. The report may be obtained by writing 

to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73152. 

Basis of Accounting 

The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of. 

interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are 

made. Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized 

disclosed measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the 

present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee 

services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no 

actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an under-funded pension 

benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Employee Retirement System (continued) 

Funding Policy 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. The contribution 

rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes. 

The rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee's earnings plus employer-

paid fringe benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation. 

Additionally, OTRS receives "federal matching contributions" for positions whose funding comes from 

federal sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable 

compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its 

revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. The District 

contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% 

during this year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System to make the 

required contributions on behalf of the participating members. The school is required to pay 16.5% for any 

compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits. 

Annual Pension Cost 

The District's total contributions for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $1,064,531.63, $1,079,603.31 and 

$1,261,806.68 respectively. The District's total payroll for fiscal year 2017-18 amounted to $11,715,540.83. 

5. Litigation 

The District is contingently liable for lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of its operations. The 

settlement of such contingencies under the budgetary process would require appropriation of revenues yet 

to be realized, and would not materially affect the financial position of the District at June 30, 2018. 

6. Related Entities 

The following entities are separately constituted and, accordingly, their financial position and results of 

operations have not been presented in the accompanying financial statements. Officers are not appointed 

by the school board. The school board is not responsible for approving budgets, contracts, key personnel, 

fiscal matters or day-to-day operations of the booster club. 

Noble Ag Boosters 

7. Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 

assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial 

insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials 

liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in 

any of the past three fiscal years. 

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is transfer 

or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASS No. 10, the School 

reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the 

Oklahoma School Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' 

compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. In that capacity, OSAG is 

responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract 

arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for 

any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is required 

to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the 

District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses 

based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund, 

so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use 

their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest.

NOBLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-40 
CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. For all federal programs, the District uses the fund types prescribed by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 
Oklahoma. The General Fund is used to account for resources restricted, or designated for, 
specific purposes by a granter. Federal and state financial assistance generally is accounted for 
in the General Fund. 

2. The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund· is determined by its 
measurement focus. The Governmental Fund types are accounted for using a current financial 
measurement focus. All federal grant funds were accounted for in the General Fund, which is a 
Governmental Fund type. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current 
liabilities and the fund balance are included on the balance sheet. Operating statements of this 
is fund present increases and decreases in net current assets. 

The Regulatory Basis of Accounting is used for the Governmental Fund types and Agency 
Funds. This basis of accounting recognizes revenue from all sources when they are received. 
Federal grant funds are considered to be recognized when encumbered or reserved to the 
extent of expenditures made under the provisions of the grant. 

3. I Positive amounts listed in the either "Balance at July 1, 2017" or "Balance at June 30, 2018" 
column represent funds received by the school and not yet expended or coded to the program. 
Negative amounts represent expenditures which have been claimed, but the revenue not yet 
collected. 

4. The District received donated foods through the Federal Food Distribution Program (10.555). At 
June 30, 2018, the school maintained an immaterial amount of food commodities inventory. Per 
the Regulatory Basis of Accounting, the commodities received and used are not recognized as 
revenue or expenditures in the school's Financial Statements. 

5. The District transferred $83,000.00, from Title II, Part A to Title I, this amount was expended as 
Title I funds, this is shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards in the Transfer In/ 

(Out) column. 

6. Reconciliation of the revenue shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards to 
Statement of Revenue, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is as follows: 

Total revenue per "Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards" $ 2,076,373.96

REPORTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON 
COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Noble School District No. 1-40 
Cleveland County, Oklahoma 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-
regulatory basis within the combined financial statements of Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, 
Oklahoma (District), as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and 
have issued my report thereon dated February 13, 2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of 
the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and 
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, 
my report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account group with respect to the 
presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State 
Board of Education. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing my opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section 
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal 
control that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been 
identified. 

32 



Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and 
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 
financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 
objective of my audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 
Standards. I noted certain immaterial instances of noncompliance that I have reported to management in the 
"Schedule of Comments" on page 36 of this report. 

Purpose of this Report 

This report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering the entity's inter I control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 
other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL 
PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE 

OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Noble School District No. 1-40 
Cleveland County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the compliance of Noble School District No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma (District's) 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each Of the District's major federal 
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary 
of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 
applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs based 
on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those 
standards and Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 
and material effect on a major program occurred. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence about 
the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as I consider 
necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, Noble School District, No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material respects, 
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each 

·of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

34 



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of Noble School District ·No. 1-40, Cleveland County, Oklahoma (District), is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District's 
internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on 
each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program, on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that 
material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or 
detected and corrected on, a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over 
compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that I considered to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have

NOBLE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-40 
CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

SCHEDULE OF COMMENTS 
JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018 

The following conditions, while not representing material weaknesses in the system of internal accounting 
control, represent areas noted during my review of the school's accounting system in which I feel improvements 
in the internal control and/or operational efficiency may be attained. I have also noted, as required, any 
noncompliance with State Department of Education Regulations. · 

I. Condition: Approximately 40% of Activity Fund source receipts tested had not been deposited with the 
Activity Fund Custodian in a timely manner. All untimely deposits were over $100.00. 

Recommendation: State law requires activity fund monies to be deposited daily if amounts are at least 
$100 or weekly if amounts are less than $100.00. When sponsors (normally teachers) hold funds. 
overnight or longer, it increases the opportunity for lost or stolen funds. We recommend that all activity 
funds collected each day should be turned into the Activity Fund Custodian for immediate deposit. 

II. Condition: The district entered into lease-purchase agreements with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma; 
Inc. on April 1, 2011 in the amounts of $18,375,000.00 amortized with principal and interestamounts 
designed to coincide with issuance of the series of the $22,710,000.00 of building bonds authorized by 
Noble School District voters on August 24, 2010. The district planned to use the proceeds of these 
general obligation bonds to finance the installments of the lease financing obligations. The proceeds 
provided by the lease financing would be used to complete the projects approved by the voters when the 
bonds were authorized. · 

The lease-purchase agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc., was structured so that as the 
lease-purchase principal and interest payments become due, the district should be able to sell series of 
the August 2010 authorized bonds in amounts that would coincide with the lease-purchase obligations, 
however the sale of those bonds, including existing indebtedness must not exceed the district's 
constitutional debt limit. The district had principal and interest obligations of $4,499, 105.00 due August 
15, 2017 under the lease-purchase agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. for which they 
intended to issue a portion of the authorized but unsold bonds of 2010, however, the district's 
constitutional debt limit prohibited issuing another series of bonds in amounts sufficient to cover the 
principal and interest payments due. 

In order to pay the amounts owed to Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. due on August 15, 2017, the 
Noble School Board entered into another ground lease and sub-lease purchase agreement with 
Cleveland County Educational Facilities Authority dated August 1, 2017, in the amount of 

. $41,424, 772.50. This financing was needed to pay off the remaining balance due on the 2011 lease-
purchase agreement of $12,520,909.62 and to provide for additional monies for acquisition, construction, 
equipping, renovating, and remodeling school buildings and acquiring school equipment. 

The "re-financing" of the 2011 sublease agreementtotaling $12,520,909.62 in effect was paying lease-
purchase payments with monies financed by additional lease-purchase financing. This appears to violate 
Oklahoma State Law, Title 62, Section 430.1 sub-section (E) which states: 

"The payment for the lease or rental of real or personal property shall be made only from annual or 
supplemental appropriations specifically designated for such purpose, and no appropriation for the 
purpose of paying rental on real or personal property shall be transferred or diverted to any other 
purpose, except as may be authorized by the terms of the agreement or by law." 

Because the school district utilized proceeds from another lease-purchase agreement, rather than 
"annual and supplemental appropriations designated for such purpose" to pay the remainder of the 
2011 sub-lease agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc., it appears the April, 2017 lease-
purchase agreement proceeds should not have been used for the purpose.

Condition (continued)

CLEVELAND COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

SCHEDULE OF COMMENTS 
JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018 

Furthermore, the school district incurred additional bond costs of issuance and interest expense to pay off 
the 2011 sub-lease agreement with Rural Enterprises of Oklahoma, Inc. above the original amounts set 
forth in the sub-lease agreement dated in 2011. 

Recommendation: We recommend the school district comply with Oklahoma state statutes relating to 
payments of lease-purchase agreements.
