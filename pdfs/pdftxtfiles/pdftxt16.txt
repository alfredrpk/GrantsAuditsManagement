Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Norman Independent School District No. 29 
Norman, Oklahoma  
 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund 
and the aggregate remaining fund information of Norman Independent School District No. 29 (the 
District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018 and the related notes to the financial statements, 
which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. 
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions. 
 
Opinions 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the Norman Independent School District No. 29, as of June 30, 2018, and the 
respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.

Emphasis of Matter 
 

Implementation of GASB No. 75 

As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements, the District has adopted the provisions of 
GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions, which had no net impact on beginning net position. Our opinion is not modified with respect to 
this matter. 
 
Other Matters 

 

Required Supplementary Information 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 
discussion and analysis, budgetary comparison schedule – General Fund, the schedule of District’s 
proportionate share of the net pension liability, the schedule of District’s contributions - pension, the 
schedule of District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB liability (asset), and the schedule of District’s 
contributions - OPEB on pages 4 through 11 and 34 through 39 be presented to supplement the basic 
financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by 
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial 
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical 
context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted 
of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the 
information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, 
and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an 
opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us 
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 
 
Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the District’s basic financial statements.  The combining nonmajor fund financial statements; 
the budgetary comparison schedule – Building Fund; the budgetary comparison schedule – Child 
Nutrition Fund; the combining schedule of changes in assets and liabilities – all activity funds; the 
schedule of statutory, fidelity, and honesty bonds; and the schedule of accountants’ professional liability 
insurance affidavit are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the 
basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and 
is also not a required part of the financial statements. 
 
The combining nonmajor fund financial statements, the combining schedule of changes in assets and 
liabilities – all activity funds, and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records 
used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America. In our opinion, the combining nonmajor fund financial statements, the combining schedule of 
changes in assets and liabilities – all activity funds, and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. 
 



 

 3 

The budgetary comparison schedule – Building Fund; budgetary comparison schedule – Child Nutrition 
Fund; the schedule of statutory, fidelity and honesty bonds; and the schedule of accountants’ professional 
liability insurance affidavit have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 
basic financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on 
them. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 11, 
2019 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other 
matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over 
financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the 
District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2018 

 
This section of Norman Independent School District’s (NISD or the District) annual financial report presents our 
discussion and analysis of the District’s financial performance during the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2018.  
Please read it in conjunction with the District’s financial statements, which immediately follow this section. 
 
These statements reflect the implementation of GASB statements 68 and 71 all addressing the accounting and 
presentation of pension plans which impacts the district-wide financial statements but not the fund financial 
statements for both years presented.  For the District, this includes the District’s portion of the unfunded liability 
of the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) to the district-wide financial statements.  While the 
implementation of these standards have had a significant impact on the statements by decreasing net position, 
management does not believe that it indicates a true negative impact on the financial condition of the institution. 
 
The District adopted GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits 
Other Than Pensions (GASB 75).   GASB 75 was issued in June 2015 and replaces the requirements of 
Statements No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions, and No. 57, OPEB Measurements by Agent Employers and Agent Multiple-Employer Plans, for OPEB. 
The Statement establishes standards for recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, 
deferred inflows of resources, and expense/expenditures. The provisions of GASB No. 75 are effective for fiscal 
years beginning after June 15, 2017. The adoption of GASB No. 75 resulted in no change to net position as of 
July 1, 2017. 
 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 

• The District’s financial status increased by approximately $3.9 million from last year.  Total net position 
increased approximately 12 percent over the course of the year.  

 

− Overall revenues were $146.7 million and overall expenses were $142.8 million.  

− The District’s portion of the net pension liability decreased by $24.3 million due to a smaller overall 
pension liability for Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System.   

 
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 
This annual report consists of three parts -- management’s discussion and analysis (this section), the basic 
financial statements, and supplementary information (required and other).  The basic financial statements include 
two kinds of statements that present different views of the District: 
 

• The first two statements are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and long-term 
information about the District’s overall financial status. 

 

• The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District, reporting 
the District’s operation in more detail than the district-wide statements. 

 

• The governmental funds statements tell how basic services like regular and special education were financed in 
the short term as well as what remains for future spending. 

 
The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and provide 
more detailed data.  The statements are followed by a section of supplementary information (required and 
other) that further explains and supports the financial statements with a comparison of the District’s budget 
for the year.

Figure A-1 summarizes the major features of the District’s financial statements.  The remainder of this overview 
section of management’s discussion and analysis highlights the structure and contents of each of the statements. 
 
District-wide Statements 

 
The district-wide statements report information about the District as a whole using accounting methods similar to 
those used by private-sector companies.  The statement of net position includes all of the District’s assets and 
liabilities.  All of the current year’s revenues and expenses are accounted for in the statement of activities 
regardless of when cash is received or paid.  As stated above, the district-wide statements were significantly 
impacted by the implementation of new standards related to recording the District’s portion of the net pension 
liability.   
 
The two district-wide statements report the District’s net position and how they have changed.  Net position – the 
difference between the District’s assets plus deferred outflows of resources and liabilities plus deferred inflows of 
resources – is one way to measure the District’s financial health or position. 
 

• Over time, increases or decreases in the District’s net position are an indicator of whether its financial 
position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 
 

• To assess the overall health of the District, you need to consider additional non-financial factors such as 
changes in the District’s property tax base and the condition of school buildings and other facilities.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2018 

 
 
In the district-wide financial statements, the District’s activities are categorized as governmental activities. 
 

• Governmental activities – The District’s basic services are included here, such as regular and special 
education, transportation, and administration.  Property taxes and state aid formula finance most of these 
activities. 

 

Fund Financial Statements 

 
The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District’s funds, focusing on its most 
significant or “major” funds – not the District as a whole.  Funds are accounting devices the District uses to keep 
track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs: 
 

• Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants. 
 

• The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like repaying its 
long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues. 

 
The District’s basic services are included in governmental funds, which generally focus on 1) how cash and other 
financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in and out and 2) the balances left at year-end that are 
available for spending.  Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide a detailed short-term view that 
helps you determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to 
finance the District’s programs.  Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of 
the district-wide statements, we provide additional information with the governmental funds statements that 
explain the relationship (or differences) between them.

Net Position.   

 

As a result of the pension standards reflected in both fiscal years presented, the District’s unrestricted net position 
is in a deficit position, increasing by $1.1 million in FY18.  (See Table A-1).  Again, management does not 
believe that this indicates a true negative impact on the financial condition of the institution.

The District’s change in financial position is the product of many factors.  A growth during the year in taxes had a 
favorable impact on net position.  Other notable factors were the slight decrease in Federal and state grants and 
State entitlement payments to school districts increased.

Changes in net position.  The District’s total revenues increased $4.2 million to $146.7 million.  (See Table A-2) 
Property taxes and state entitlement funds accounted for most of the District’s revenue, with each contributing 
about 75 cents of every dollar raised.  Another 11.2 percent came from state and federal aid for specific programs, 
and the remainder from fees charged for services and miscellaneous sources. Total revenues surpassed expenses, 
increasing net position by $3.9 million. 
 
The total cost of all programs and services decreased by $4.2 million between the two years.  The District’s 
expenses are predominantly related to educating and caring for students (80-90 percent). The purely 
administrative activities of the District accounted for less than 1 percent of total costs.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Unaudited) 
June 30, 2018 

 
 
The most significant contributors to the fluctuation in net position were the funds used to purchase or build capital 
assets, and also the funds necessary for repayment of principal on long-term debt issues.  Repayments on long-
term debt this year were larger than debt issued in FY18.  The net pension liability and the related deferred 
inflows and outflows of resources also created significant fluctuations largely due to actuarial factors related to 
the liability.   

 
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT’S FUNDS 
 
As the District completed the year, its governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $44.1 million, 
compared to last year’s ending fund balances of $46.2 million.  In comparison to FY17’s net increase in fund 
balance of $0.5 million, this year’s decrease was $2.1 million largely due to the variance in bond proceeds in 
FY18 in comparison to FY17.     
  
General Fund Budgetary Highlights 
 
At the beginning of the 2018 fiscal year, the District’s State Entitlement funds (the State Aid Formula funds) were 
increased by approximately $640,000 from the previous fiscal year.  This was due to legislation enacted to 
generate additional revenue enhancements such as cigarette fees, tax on vehicle purchases, and elimination of 
some gross production tax breaks and rebates.  
 
This initial allocation in State Aid was increased by $1,065,000 in January, when the mid-term adjustments were 
made by the State Department of Education.  Our District’s first nine weeks student enrollment increased by 191 
students from the prior year.  Also, our District reported higher student counts in the weighted categories, thus 
providing a 528 overall student growth in the State Aid funding formula for the District. 
 

• Due to the Supreme Court striking down the cigarette fee passed as unconstitutional, a $215 million budget 
hole was created in the State budget.  As a result, our district State Aid was reduced $361,000 in March. 

   

• After failing to approve several comprehensive revenue proposals, lawmakers used some $170 million in one-
time revenues to help fill the budget hole while also cutting some state agency budgets by 2 percent for the 
four remaining months of 2018. 
 

• Actual revenues were higher than expected at mid-year, due largely to a high collection rate of property tax 
revenues.  Also, County 4-mill ad valorem revenue, school land earnings, and motor vehicle collections 
revenue increased. 

 

• The actual expenditures were below budget, due primarily to the shifting of expenses to other funds and by 
expenditure budgets that remained unspent at June 30, 2018.

CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 

 

Capital Assets 

 

By the end of 2018, the District had invested nearly $8 million in a broad range of capital assets, including new 
classroom additions, athletic facilities, computer and audiovisual equipment, and building improvements.   
 
The District anticipates spending approximately $4 million for capital projects in 2019, with some of the major 
projects as follows: 
 

 

• $500,000 to finalize renovations at the two high schools 

 

• $2,500,000 for various elementary and middle school site improvements 

 
See additional information regarding Capital Assets in Note 3 to the Notes to the Financial Statements.   

 
Long-term Debt 

 
At year-end the District had $143.6 million in total long-term debt outstanding (including compensated absences).  
This is a decrease from last year’s amount of $154.3 million.   
 

• The District continued to pay down its debt, retiring $22 million of outstanding bonds.  
 

• $29,480,000 in new debt was issued during the year. 
 
In February 2014, the District patrons voted on and approved five-year bond issue.  This issue, for $126 million, 
is funded with lease revenue bonds.  General obligation bonds will be sold for five years, to make the annual lease 
revenue payments required. The bonds will be issued in a timely manner over five years to match current millage 
rates to assure citizens will not face any additional taxes. 
 
See additional information regarding Long-term Debt in Note 4 to the Notes to the Financial Statements.

At the time these financial statements were prepared and audited, the District was aware of the following existing 
circumstances that could significantly affect its financial health in the future:  
 

• Even though the legislature provided a slight increase to State funding for education going into 2018, state aid 
funding for public schools remained $179 million below 2008 levels, while enrollment increased by over 
50,000 students. 

 

• Education funding hasn’t kept pace with skyrocketing healthcare costs, increasing enrollment or the growth in 
student needs. 

 

• Oklahoma’s neighboring states invest substantially more in common education on a per-student basis. Other 
states in our region reached Oklahoma’s current level of per student education investment a decade ago. 

 

• Oklahoma educators reached a breaking point in April 2018, and held a walkout at the Capitol, demanding 
increased pay for salaries and for operational expenditures.  After two weeks, lawmakers passed legislation 
that promised to increase certified and support salaries beginning in 2019. 

 

• The funding approved by lawmakers for education is just a start and doesn’t come close to fully funding 
education.  There is widespread agreement that lawmakers must do more to fund our schools and provide 
teachers and other employees a fair and competitive salary. 

 

• Oklahoma’s historic teacher shortage will continue to grow without a long-term vision and funding plan for 
education that’s focused on providing a high-quality education for every child.

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of net position are different because:
Capital assets used in governmental activities are not financial resources and therefore are not reported as assets 
in governmental funds. The cost of the assets is $337,662,883 and the accumulated depreciation is $109,550,190. 228,112,693    

Property taxes receivable will be collected next year, but are not available soon enough to pay for the current
period's expenditures, and therefore are not reported in the funds. 5,153,091        

Deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to the net pension liability are not are not current financial resources
and are not recorded in the fund financial statements but are recorded in the governmental activities.

Deferred inflows of resources (14,244,858)     10,383,417      

Long-term liabilities are not due and payable in the current period and, therefore, are not reported

(235,835)           

Change in net position of governmental activities 3,892,531$       

Bond premiums are shown as a liability on the statement of net position and as revenue in the governmental fund. The bond premium is 

amortized against interest expense using the effective interest method.

Interest on long-term debt in the statement of activities differs from the amount reported in the governmental funds because interest is 

recorded as an expenditure in the funds when it is due, and thus requires the use of current financial resources when paid. In the 

statement of activities, however, interest expense is recognized as the interest accrued, regardless of when it is due.

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in governmental funds as expenditures. However, for governmental 

activities those costs are shown in the statement allocated over their estimated useful lives as annual depreciation expenses in the 

statement of activities. This is the amount by which depreciation exceeds capital outlays during the period.

Because some property taxes will not be collected for several months after the District's fiscal year ends, they are not considered as 

"available" revenues in the governmental funds and are, instead counted as unavailable revenues. They are, however, recorded as 

revenues in the statement of activities.

In the statement of activities, compensated absences are measured by the amounts earned during the year. In the governmental funds, 

however, expenditures for these items are measured by the amount of financial resources used (essentially the amounts actually paid). 

This year, vacation and sick leave used exceeded amounts earned.

Long term debt, such as bond proceeds, are reported as financing sources in governmental funds and thus contribute to the change in 

fund balance. In the statement of net position, however issuing debt increases long-term liabilities and does not affect the statement of 

activities. Similarly, repayment of principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds but reduces the liability in the statement of net 

position.

Changes in deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to the net pension liability are not current financial resources and are not 

recorded in the fund financial statements but are recorded in the governmental activities.

Norman Independent School District No. 29 
Cleveland County, Oklahoma 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 

 
 

Note 1 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The Norman Independent School District No. 29 (the District) is a corporate body for public purposes created 
under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting 
purposes. The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of 
the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma for support.  The general 
operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The District’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). 
 
The Reporting Entity - The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected 
members. The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  There are no component units 
included within the reporting entity. 
 
Basic Financial Statements – Government-Wide Statements - The District’s basic financial statements include 
both government-wide (reporting the District as a whole) and fund financial statements (reporting the District’s 
major funds). Both the government-wide and fund financial statements categorize primary activities as either 
governmental.  Governmental Activities include programs primarily supported by taxes, State aid, grants and 
other intergovernmental revenue.  
 
In the government-wide Statement of Net Position, the District’s governmental activities are reported on a full 
accrual, economic resource basis, which recognizes all long-term assets and receivables as well as long-term debt 
and obligations.  These statements also recognize deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources.  The District’s net position are reported in three parts – net investment in capital assets; restricted net 
position; and unrestricted net position.  
 
The government-wide Statement of Activities reports both the gross and net cost of each of the District’s 
programs and functions. The functions are also supported by general government revenues. The Statement of 
Activities reduces gross expenses (including depreciation) by related program revenues, operating and capital 
grants. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function.  Program revenues must be 
directly associated with the function.  Charges for services include charges and fees to students, or customers who 
purchase, use or directly benefit from the goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function. Operating 
grants include operating-specific and discretionary (either operating or capital) grants while the capital grants 
column reflects capital-specific grants.  
 
All interfund transactions are eliminated in the district-wide statements. 
 
The net costs are normally covered by general revenue (property taxes, State and Federal aid, other taxes etc.). 
 
The government-wide focus is more on the sustainability of the District as an entity and the change in the 
District’s net position resulting from the current year’s activities. Major individual governmental funds are 
reported in separate columns in the fund financial statements.

Basic Financial Statements – Fund Financial Statements - Governmental fund financial statements are 
reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. 
With this measurement focus, only current assets, current liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, and fund 
balances are included on the balance sheet. The fund financial statements provide reports on the financial 
condition and results of operations of governmental fund categories.  
  
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 
 

• General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial resources 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 

 

• Debt Service Fund is used to account for the accumulation of funds for the periodic payment of principal and 
interest on general long-term debt. 

 

• 2018 Bond Fund is used to account for the financial resources to be used for the acquisition or construction 
of major capital facilities as approved by the voters for the 2018 bond issue. 

 
Additionally, the District reports the following fund types included in the Other Governmental Funds column: 
  
Governmental Funds: 

1. Special Revenue Funds – The District accounts for resources restricted for specific purposes by the 
District or a grantor in a special revenue fund.  

2. Capital Project Funds – The proceeds from long-term financing and revenues and expenditures related to 
authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions are accounted for in a capital projects fund. 

 
Basis of Accounting - Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the 
accounts and reported in the financial statements. It relates to the timing of the measurements made regardless of 
the measurement focus applied. 
 
Accrual: The government-wide financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues 
are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when a liability is incurred. Property taxes are 
recognized as revenue in the year in which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as 
soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. 
 
Modified Accrual: The funds’ financial statements are presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. 
Under modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual; i.e. both 
measurable and available. “Available” means collectible within the current period or within 60 days after year 
end. Expenditures are generally recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related 
liability is incurred. The exception to this general rule is that principal and interest on general obligation long-
term debt, if any, is recognized when due.

Inventories - Inventories in the general fund consist of expendable supplies held for the District’s use and are 
carried at cost using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are accounted for using the consumption method 
where materials and supplies are recorded as an expenditure when used rather than when purchased. 
 
On the government-wide financial statements, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food 
commodities are recorded as revenue at fair value at the date of receipt and as an expense when used. USDA food 
commodities are not reported in the governmental funds.  
 
Capital Assets - Capital assets purchased with an original cost of $2,500 or more are reported at historical cost or 
acquisition value on the date of donation if acquired by gift. Additions, improvements and other capital outlays 
that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and 
maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation on all assets is provided on the straight-line basis over the 
following estimated useful lives: 
 
 School Buildings   50 years 
 Site Improvements   20 years 
 Portable Classrooms   25 years 
 Kitchen Equipment   15 years 
 Business Machines and Computers   5 years 
 Licensed Vehicles     8 years 
 Audio Visual Equipment,  

Musical Instruments  10 years 
 
Compensated Absences - Certified District employees earn sick leave starting the first day of the school year, as 
defined for each individual. Support personnel are eligible for paid sick leave benefits after 90 days. Sick leave is 
accrued at different rates depending on number of contract days worked. Unused sick leave is cumulative up to 
185 days. Upon termination, resignation, retirement or death, unused sick leave is reimbursable up to a maximum 
of 120 days at rates varying from $5 per day for the first 30 days to $25 per day for the last 20 days.  Vacation 
days accrue by month only after the completion of the full month. The rate of accrual is based on the number of 
contract days an employee works. Vacation may be accumulated up to 80 days. Reimbursement for unused 
vacation is paid at 100% of the employee's current rate of pay. 
 
Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources – Deferred outflows represent a consumption of net position that 
applies to a future period(s) and so they will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense) until then.  
The District’s deferred outflows of resources were comprised of statutorily required pension contributions, 
changes in actuarial assumptions, and changes in proportion that are applicable to future reporting periods. 
 
Deferred inflows are the acquisition of net position by the District that is applicable to a future reporting period.  
The District’s deferred inflows of resources were comprised of amounts recognized as receivables but not 
revenues in the governmental funds because the revenue recognition criteria (availability) has not been met and, at 
the government-wide level, changes in net pension liability and the net OPEB asset related to experience that are 
applicable to future reporting periods.

Budgets and Budgetary Accounting - The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. The 
District by resolution of the Board of Education has adopted the School District Budget Act. This act requires that 
within the thirty-day period preceding the beginning of each fiscal year, a budget shall be approved by the 
governing body. The original budget is to be amended after the June financial activity has been recorded, the 
annual allocations have been released, and the property tax valuations have been certified for all affected counties 
within the district. 
 
A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund and Special Revenue Funds that 
includes revenues and expenditures.  
 
Deposits - The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits, money market checking and certificates of 
deposit, held at an individual bank which are subject to early withdrawal penalties no matter what the maturity 
period, to be cash.  All short-term cash surpluses are maintained in a cash pool, the earnings from which are 
allocated to each fund based on month-end deposit balances. State statues require collateral for deposits in excess 
of insured amounts. The collateral’s market value must exceed the insured deposit. 
 
Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which consist of 
advalorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the 
certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the 
county treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of 
receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1. 
 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 1. Second half taxes 
become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If not paid by the following October 
1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem the property by 
paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a 
deed to the property. 
 
Property taxes receivable by the District include uncollected taxes assessed in prior years. Delinquent property tax 
receivable is recognized as revenue in the government-wide financial statements. Only the portion of the property 
taxes receivable that meets the revenue recognition criteria is reported as revenue in the fund financial statements. 
No provision has been made for uncollectible amounts because uncollectible amounts are considered 
insignificant. 
 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid 
formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education 
administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the 
districts. Approximately 40% of the District’s revenue comes from state sources. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may 
adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally, such 
adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State Board of 
Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the programs for which 
the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried 
forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of 
Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund.

Interfund Transfers - During the course of normal operations, the District has transactions between funds 
including expenditures and transfers of resources to provide services, purchase assets and service debt. 
Transactions that are normal and recurring between funds are recorded as transfers. 
 
Bond Premium - Bond premiums are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using the effective 
interest method. 
 
Pensions - For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred 
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the 
Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position 
have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments 
(including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the 
benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. 
 
OPEB - For purposes of measuring the net OPEB asset, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Oklahoma 
Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position have been 
determined on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including 
refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. 
Investments are reported at fair value. 
 
Net Position and Fund Balance - District-Wide Financial Statements – When the District incurs an expense for 
which it may use either restricted or unrestricted net position, it uses restricted net position first unless 
unrestricted net position will have to be returned because they were not used.  
  
Net position on the Statement of Net Position include the following: 
 

Net investment in Capital Assets - The component of net position that reports the difference between 
capital assets less both the accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balance of debt, including 
premiums and discounts, excluding unspent proceeds, that is directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or improvement of these capital assets. 
 
Restricted for Debt Service - The component of net position that reports the amount of funds restricted for 
payment of principal and interest on debt. This amount is restricted by enabling legislation and debt 
covenants. 
 
Restricted for Buildings - The component of net position that reports the excess of property taxes and 
other revenue collected in excess of expenses for operation of the District’s buildings. This amount is 
restricted by enabling legislation. 
 
Restricted for School Organizations - The component of net position that reports the assets restricted for 
use by student organizations and extracurricular activities. This amount is restricted by regulations of the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
 
Restricted for Child Nutrition - The component of net position that reports the assets restricted for use by 
Child Nutrition program.

Restricted for OPEB – The component of net position that reports the net OPEB asset restricted for other 
post-employment benefits and deferred outflows of resources, netted against its related deferred inflows 
of resources. 
 
Unrestricted – The difference between the sum of assets and deferred outflows of resources and the sum 
of liabilities and deferred inflows of resources that is not reported as restricted for any particular purpose. 

 
Governmental Fund Financial Statements – The District follows Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Types, which defines how fund balances of 
the governmental funds are presented in the financial statements. The governmental fund financial statements 
present fund balances based on classifications that comprise a hierarchy that is based primarily on the extent to 
which the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in the respective 
governmental funds can be spent. The classifications used in the governmental fund financial statements are as 
follows: 

Nonspendable: This classification includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in 
spendable form or (b) are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. The District has classified 
inventory as being nonspendable as these items are not expected to be converted to cash or are not expected to 
be converted to cash within the next year. 

Restricted: This classification includes amounts for which constraints have been placed on the use of the 
resources either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through a debt covenant), grantors, contributors, 
or laws or regulations of other governments, or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or 
enabling legislation. The District has classified school construction and building maintenance expenditures as 
being restricted because their use is restricted by state statute or legislation regarding use of expenditures. 
Debt service resources are to be used for future servicing of the debt and are restricted through debt 
covenants. Food service resources are to be used for the District’s child nutrition program and are restricted 
through federal and state regulations.  The District has classified school program activities, miscellaneous site 
grants and grant carryover as being restricted because their use is imposed by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education or other authority regarding use of expenditures.  Other purposes are restricted for insurance 
purposes and scholarship purposes from contributors. 

Committed: This classification includes amounts that can be used only for specific purposes pursuant to 
constraints imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. These amounts cannot be used for any other 
purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of action 
(resolution) that was employed when the funds were initially committed. This classification also includes 
contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources have been specifically committed for use in 
satisfying those contractual requirements. There were no committed balances as of June 30, 2018. 
 
Assigned: This classification includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be used for a 
specific purpose but are neither restricted nor committed. This intent can be expressed by the Board of 
Education or through the Board of Education delegating this responsibility to management through the 
budgetary process. The District has no assigned funds as of June 30, 2018.

Unassigned: This classification includes the residual fund balance for the General Fund. The unassigned 
classification would also include any negative residual fund balance of any other governmental fund that cannot 
be eliminated by offsetting of assigned fund balance amounts. The District has not established a formal 
stabilization arrangement regarding minimum funding requirements. The Board of Education, however, has made 
it a goal to achieve and maintain a minimum fund balance of 5% in the general fund of the current year total 
revenue collections as well as a minimum fund balance in the building fund of 35% of the current year total 
revenue collections.  
 
As of June 30, 2018, fund balances are comprised of the following:

The District would typically use restricted fund balances first, followed by committed resources, and then 
assigned resources, as appropriate opportunities arise, but reserves the right to selectively spend unassigned 
resources first to defer the use of these other classified funds. 
 
New Accounting Pronouncement - The District adopted GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial 
Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (GASB 75).   GASB 75 was issued in June 2015 
and replaces the requirements of Statements No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for 
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, and No. 57, OPEB Measurements by Agent Employers and Agent 
Multiple-Employer Plans, for OPEB. The Statement establishes standards for recognizing and measuring 
liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources, and expense/expenditures. The 
provisions of GASB No. 75 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2017. The adoption of GASB 
No. 75 resulted in no change to net position as of July 1, 2017.

Note 2 -  Cash  
 
Deposits - At June 30, 2018, the bank balance of deposits and cash pools was $55,609,188. Custodial credit risk 
is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned to it. State statutes require 
collateral for amounts in excess of federally insured amounts. The deposit policy for custodial credit risk requires 
compliance with the provisions of state law. The bank balance was completely covered by federal depository 
insurance and by collateral held by the District’s third-party agent in the District’s name. 
 
Interest Rate Risk – The District does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a means of 
managing its exposure to fair value losses from increasing interest rates.

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be received for 
any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by the voters and issued 
by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years 
from the date of issue. General obligation bonded debt of the District is limited by state law to 10% of the 
assessed valuation of the District. The legal debt limit for general obligation bonds at June 30, 2018 is 
approximately $96.1 million.  
 
Proceeds of general obligation bond issues are recorded in the capital project funds and at least 85% of the 
proceeds are restricted to the use for which they were approved in the bond elections.   
 
See additional discussion of lease revenue payable at Note 11.   
 
 

Note 5 -  Employee Retirement System 
 

Plan Description - The District contributes to the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System 
("the System" or “OTRS”), a cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement plan (the Plan). The 
System is administered by a board of trustees. OTRS provides retirement, disability and death benefits to plan 
members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statute 70, Article 17 assigns the authority to establish and amend 
benefit provisions to the OTRS Board of Trustees. Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net 
position is available in the separately issued financial report of the System; which can be located at 
www.ok.gov/OTRS. 
 
Policy - Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating 
employees. Participation is required for all teachers and other certified employees and is optional for all other 
regular employees of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. 
 
Contributions - The contribution rates for the District and its employees, which are not actuarially determined, 
are established by statute and applied to the employee's earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits. The District 
was required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable compensation for the year ended June 30, 2018. Plan 
members are required to contribute 7% of their annual covered salary. The District pays full-time employees’ 
contribution as allowed by statute. A portion of the contributions received by OTRS are allocated to the 
Supplemental Health Insurance program; see Note 6.  Contributions to the pension plan from the District were 
$6,883,569 for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The State of Oklahoma also made on-behalf contributions to 
OTRS, of which $4,489,362 was recognized by the District; these on-behalf payments did not meet the criteria of 
a special funding situation.

Benefits - Benefit provisions include: 

 
• Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years of credited Oklahoma 

service. Members who joined the System on June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire at maximum 
benefits when age and years of creditable service total 80. Members joining the System after June 30, 
1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their age and years of creditable service total 90. Members 
whose age and service do not equal the eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as early as age 55, and 
at age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on their years of service. The maximum retirement benefit is 
equal to 2% of final compensation for each year of credited service. 

 
• Final compensation for members who joined the System prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as the average 

salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for members joining the System 
after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive years of annual compensation 
in which contributions have been made. The final average compensation is limited for service credit 
accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, depending on the member’s election. Monthly 
benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits accumulated after June 30, 1995 are calculated based on 
each member’s final average compensation, except for certain employees of the two comprehensive 
universities.  
 

• Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired, the designated beneficiary shall receive the 
member’s total contributions plus 100% of interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with interest 
rates varying based on time of service. A surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, in 
lieu of the aforementioned benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled to at the time of death 
as provided under the Joint Survivor Benefit Option. 

 
• Upon the death of a retired member, the System will pay $5,000 to the designated beneficiary, in addition 

to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the member.  
 
• A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. The disability 

benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable years of credited service. 
 

• Upon separation from OTRS, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based on certain 
restrictions provided in the plan, or by the IRC. 

 
• Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program up to the 

exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b). 
 

 
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 

Resources Related to Pensions - At June 30, 2018, the District reported a liability of $106,571,969 for its 
proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and 
the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
June 30, 2017. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s contributions 
received by the pension plan relative to the total contributions received by pension plan for all participating 
employers as of June 30, 2017.  Based upon this information, the District’s proportion was 1.6095%, an increase 
of 0.0418% from the proportion at June 30, 2016.

valuation prepared as of June 30, 2017 using the following actuarial assumptions:  
 

• Actuarial Cost Method - Entry Age Normal 

• Inflation – 2.50% 

• Future Ad Hoc Cost-of-living increases – None 

• Salary Increases - Composed of 3.25% wage inflation, including 2.50% price inflation, plus a service-
related component ranging from 0.00% to 8.00% based on years of service. 

• Investment Rate of Return – 7.50% 
• Retirement Age - Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted by the Board 

in May 2015 in conjunction with the five-year experience study for the period ending June 30, 2014. 

• Mortality Rates after Retirement- Males: RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table for males with White 
Collar Adjustments. Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale  BB from the table’s 
base year of 2000. Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, scaled 105%. Generational 
mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table’s base year of 2012. 

• Mortality Rates for Active Members - RP-2000 Employee Mortality tables, with male rates multiplied by 
60% and female rates multiplied by 50%. 

 
The actuarial assumptions used in the July 01, 2017, valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience

Discount Rate - A single discount rate of 7.5% was used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 
2017. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position 
and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future benefit payments of current 
plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all 
periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The projection of cash flows used to 
determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member and employer contributions will be made at the 
current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that 
the State’s contribution plus the matching contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member 
payroll based on the past five years of actual contributions. 
 
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate - The following presents the net 
pension liability of the employers calculated using the discount rate of 7.5%, as well as what the Plan's net 
pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower (6.5%) or 1-
percentage-point higher (8.5%) than the current rate:

Note 6 -  Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) 
 
Plan description - The District as the employer, participates in the Supplemental Health Insurance Program—a 
cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement 
System (OTRS). Title 74 O. S. Sec. 1316.3 defines the health insurance benefits. The authority to establish and 
amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a publicly available financial report that 
can be obtained at www.ok.gov/OTRS. 

 
Benefits provided - OTRS pays a medical insurance supplement to eligible members who elect to continue their 
employer provided health insurance. The supplement payment is between $100 and $105 per month, remitted to 
the Oklahoma Management Enterprise Services Employees Group Insurance Division, provided the member has 
ten (10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement.

Contributions - Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions contained 
in Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do not specify or identify any particular contribution source to pay 
the health insurance subsidy. Based on the contribution requirements of Title 70 employers and employees 
contribute a single amount based on a single contribution rate as described in Note 5; from this amount OTRS 
allocates a portion of the contributions to the supplemental health insurance program.  The cost of the 
supplemental health insurance program averages 1.5% of normal cost, as determined by an actuarial valuation. 
Contributions allocated to the OPEB plan from the District were $109,299. 
 
OPEB Liabilities (Assets), OPEB Expense (Benefit), and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred 

Inflows of Resources Related to OPEB – At June 30, 2018, the District reported an asset of $717,757 for its 
proportionate share of the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total 
OPEB asset used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017. 
The District’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on the District’s contributions received by the OPEB 
plan relative to the total contributions received by the OPEB plan for all participating employers as of June 30, 
2017.  Based upon this information, the District’s proportion was 1.6095% percent.

Note 11 -  Contingencies and Commitments 
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies.

The District is a defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the

the District’s sinking fund over a three-year period pursuant to state law.

Year Ended June 30, 2018 

 

 
Note A – Basis of Presentation 

 

The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards includes the federal grant activity of the Norman 
Independent School District No. 29 (the District), and is presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. 
The information in this schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. The 
District received federal awards both directly from federal agencies and indirectly through pass-through entities. 
No federal financial assistance has been provided to a subrecipient.   
 
 
Note B – Significant Accounting Policies

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on 

Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements 
Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards 

 
 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Norman Independent School District No. 29 
Norman, Oklahoma  
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Norman Independent School 
District No. 29 (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise Norman Independent School District No. 29’s basic 
financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated January 11, 2019.   
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District's internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we 
do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement 
of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less 
severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance.  
 
Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the 
first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
financial reporting that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, 
during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material 
weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The 
results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be 
reported under Government Auditing Standards.  
 
Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
and Report on Internal Control Over Compliance Required by the Uniform 

Guidance 

 
 
To the Board of Education 
Norman Independent School District No. 29 
Norman, Oklahoma: 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Norman Independent School District No. 29’s compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect 
on each of Norman Independent School District No. 29’s major federal programs for the year ended June 
30, 2018. Norman Independent School District No. 29’s major federal programs are identified in the 
summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility  

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the compliance for each of Norman Independent School 
District No. 29’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally 
accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those 
standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above that could 
have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence about Norman Independent School District No. 29’s compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.   
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Norman Independent 
School District No. 29’s compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, Norman Independent School District No. 29 complied, in all material respects, with the 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect of each of its major 
Federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
Management of Norman Independent School District No. 29  is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the compliance requirements referred to 
above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Norman Independent School 
District No. 29’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct 
and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 
Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal 
control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Norman 
Independent School District No. 29’s internal control over compliance.  
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a compliance requirement will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance 
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal 
control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist 
that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings 

 

 
Financial Statements 

 

Finding 2017-A 

 

Finding Summary: Eide Bailly LLP prepared our government-wide financial statements and accompanying notes 

to the financial statements.   

 

Status:  Not repeated in FY2018.    

 

 

 

 

Finding 2017-B 

 

Finding Summary:  Eide Bailly LLP proposed material audit adjustments that were the result of the District not 

recording the adjustments for the pension standard (GASB 68).   

 

Status:  Not repeated in FY2018.   

 

 

Single Audit  

 

Finding 2017-001 

Federal Agency Name: Department of Education 

Program Name:  Title I, Grants to Local Education Agencies 

CFDA #84.010 
 

 

Finding Summary:   Non-Federal entities must implement proper internal controls to ensure compliance with 

documentation of employee time and effort regulations including 2 CFR section 200.430(i)(1)(vii).  The current 

control structure requires a semi-annual certification form by both the employee and their supervisor if they work 

on any federal programs.      

 
The District did appear to have a control in place to obtain these certification forms from District employees.  

However, some of the employees in the sample had variances in the certification percentages on the forms and the 

actual amounts charged to the federal program.     

 

 

Status:  Corrected in FY2018 and not a repeat finding.
