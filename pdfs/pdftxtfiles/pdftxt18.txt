INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 
To the Board of Education 
Lawton Independent School District No. 8,  
Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Lawton, Oklahoma 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying regulatory basis financial statements of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Lawton Independent 
School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma  as of  and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial 
statements as listed in the table of contents.  
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma State Department of Education 
described in Note 1; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions. 
Summary of Opinions 

Opinion Unit   Type of Opinion  
All Adverse on US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
Governmental Activities  Qualified Regulatory Basis  
General Fund Unmodified Regulatory Basis  
2014 Bond Fund 32 Unmodified Regulatory Basis  
2017 Bond Fund 33 Unmodified Regulatory Basis  
Lease Revenue 2017 Fund 34  Unmodified Regulatory Basis  
Aggregate Remaining  Unmodified Regulatory Basis  

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
As described in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by Lawton Independent School District 
No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma 
State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, to meet the requirements of the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education. 
The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, 
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion 
on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to 
above do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, the financial position of Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche 
County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position, and, where 
applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended. 
Basis for Qualified Opinion on Governmental Activities  
As discussed in Note 16 to the financial statements, management has not recorded capital assets in the 
governmental statement of net position – regulatory basis, in governmental activities opinion unit, 
which should be included to conform to the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma State 
Department of Education. The amount by which this departure would affect the assets, net position and 
expenses of the governmental activities has not been determined.   
Qualified Opinion 
In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Qualified 
Opinion on Governmental Activities” paragraph, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, regulatory basis financial position of the Governmental Activities of 
Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018 and the 
respective changes in regulatory basis financial position  thereof for the year then ended in accordance 
with financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma State Department of Education.   
Unmodified Opinions on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
respective regulatory basis financial position of each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund

information  of the Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma, as of 
June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in regulatory basis financial position and where applicable, 
cash flows thereof for the year then ended, in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of 
Oklahoma State Department of Education as described in Note 1. 
Other Matters 
Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s 
basic financial statements. The budgetary comparison schedules, combining nonmajor fund financial 
statements, and statement of changes in activity fund subaccounts, are presented for purposes of 
additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 
U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, 
and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic financial 
statements. 
The combining nonmajor fund financial statements, statement of changes in activity fund subaccounts 
and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of management and were 
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in 
the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. 
In our opinion, the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial 
statements as a whole. 
The Oklahoma Department of Education requires management discussion and analysis, budgetary 
information and the statement of statutory fidelity and honesty bonds be presented to supplement the 
financial statements. Such information, although not considered part of the basic financial statements, 
is required by the Oklahoma Department of Education, who considers it an essential part of the 
financial reporting.  . We have applied certain limited procedures to this supplemental information 
which consisted of inquires of management about the methods of preparing the information and 
comparing the information for consistency with management’s response to our inquiries, the basic 
financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial 
statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the 
limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any 
assurance.  Management has omitted the management discussion and analysis that Oklahoma 
Department of Education requires to be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such 
missing information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Oklahoma 
Department of Education who considers it to be an essential part of the financial reporting for placing 
the basic financial statements in appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.  Our opinion 
on the basic financial statements is not affected by the missing information 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 29, 
2019, on our consideration of the Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County,

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of net position are different because:
Federal commodities are distributed to the District to be used by the child nutrition program. Governmental funds are concerned about 

the flow of financial resources and, therefore, the receipt and usage of commodities are not reported in the governmental funds 7,792

Internal service funds are used by management to charge costs of certain activities, such as insurance to individual funds 

of the Distrrict. These assets and liabilities of the internal service funds, which are reported as proprietary funds rather than

governmental funds, are included in governmental activities in the statement of net assets 31,687

Long-term liabilities are not due and payable in the current period and therefore are not

reported as liabilties in the funds. Long-term liabilities at year-end consist of :
Bonds Payable 14,695,000

Lease Purchase 55,000,000
Compensated Absences 1,522,745 (71,217,745)       

Net assets of governmental activities. 19,252,567$

Amounts reported for governmental activities

 in the statement of activities are different because:

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds 54,171,705$   

In the statement of activities, compensated absences are measured by the amounts
earned and unused during the year. In governmental funds, expenditures  is the 
amount of financial resources used (essentially the amounts actually paid).
This year, compensated absences earned were more than the amounts used. (59,918)          

Proceeds of general obligation debt provide current financial resources for governmental funds
but issuing debt increases long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets. (6,835,000)     

Repayment of debt is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but
repayment of debt reduced long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets Bonds payable 1,695,000$

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The Reporting Entity - The Lawton Independent School District No. 8 (the District) is a corporate body 
for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity 
for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the public school system of 
Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially 
dependent on the State of Oklahoma for support. The general operating authority for the public school 
system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. There are no component units included 
within the reporting entity. 
 
Financial Statement Presentation – The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format 
that is, in substance, the format established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 
Statement 34, Basic Financial Statement – Management Discussion and Analysis for State and Local 
Governments. 
 
GASB Statement 34 established a financial reporting model for state and local governments that included 
the addition of management’s discussion and analysis, government-wide financial statements and the use 
elimination of the effects of internal service activities and the use of account groups to the already required 
fund financial statements and notes. 
 
Basic Financial Statements – Government-Wide Statements 
 
The District’s basic financial statements include both government-wide (reporting the District as a 
whole) and fund financial statements (reporting the District’s major funds). Both the government-wide 
and fund financial statements categorize primary activities as either governmental or business type. 
Governmental activities include programs primarily supported by taxes, State aid, grants and other 
intergovernmental revenue. The District does not have any activities classified as business-type 
activities. 
 
In the government-wide Statement of Net Position, the District’s governmental activities are reported on 
cash receipts and disbursement basis modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma 
Department of Education to include property and equipment, depreciation and long-term debt and 
obligations.  The District’s Net Position are reported in three parts – net investment in capital assets; 
restricted net position; and unrestricted net position. 
 

 
The government-wide Statement of Activities reports both the gross and net cost of each of the District’s 
programs and functions reported on the cash receipts and disbursement basis modified for depreciation.  
The functions are also supported by general government revenues. The Statement of Activities reduces 
gross expenses (including depreciation) by related program revenues, operating and capital grants. Direct 
expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function.  Program revenues must be 
directly associated with the function.  Charges for services include charges and fees to students, or

Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 
 

17 

customers who purchase, use or directly benefit from the goods, services, or privileges provided by a 
given function. Operating grants include operating-specific and discretionary (either operating or capital) 
grants while the capital grants column reflects capital-specific grants. 
 
All interfund transactions between governmental funds and internal service funds are eliminated in the 
district- wide statements. 
 
The net costs are normally covered by general revenue (property taxes, State and Federal aid, other taxes 
etc.).  
 
The government-wide focus is more on the sustainability of the District as an entity and the change in 
the District’s net position resulting from the current year’s activities. Separate financial statements are 
provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter is 
excluded from the district- wide financial statements. Major individual governmental funds are reported 
in separate columns in the fund financial statements. 
 
Basic Financial Statements – Fund Financial Statements 
 
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the cash receipts and disbursement basis of 
accounting modified as required by the Oklahoma Department of Education to include investments, 
inventories on hand, encumbrances issued and warrants outstanding. The fund financial statements 
provide reports on the financial condition and results of operations of governmental, proprietary, and 
fiduciary fund categories. Since resources in the fiduciary funds cannot be used for District operations, 
they are not included in the district-wide statements. 
 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from nonoperating items. Operating 
revenues and expenses result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection 
with the proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. All other revenues and expenses are 
nonoperating. 
 
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 

 General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial 
resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 

 2014 Bond Fund32 is used to account for proceeds from long-term financing and revenues and 
expenditures related to voter authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions. 

 2017 Bond Fund 33 is used to account for proceeds from long-term financing and revenues and 
expenditures related to voter authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions. 

 Lease Revenue 2017 Fund 34 is used to account for proceeds from long-term financing and 
revenues and expenditures related to voter authorized construction and other capital asset 
acquisitions. 

 
Additionally, the District reports the following fund types that are included in other governmental funds:  

 Building Fund is used to account for monies derived from the building fund levy and rental of 
facilities to be used for erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings, paying

Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 
 

18 

energy and utility costs; paying fire and casualty insurance premiums for school facilities, 
security systems and personnel. 

 Municipal Tax Funds are used to account for financial resources to be used for the acquisition or 
construction of major capital facilities and equipment as approved by voters for a special sales 
tax. 

 Sinking Fund is used to account for the accumulation of funds for the periodic payment of 
principal and interest on general long-term debt. 

 2004 Bond Fund 31 are used to account for proceeds from long-term financing and revenues and 
expenditures related to voter authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions. 

 Special Revenue Funds – The District accounts for resources restricted to, or designated for, 
specific purposes by the District or a grantor in a special revenue fund. 

 Activity Fund is special revenue fund the district accounts for resources and expenditures 
incurred by the student activity groups.  

 Proprietary Funds- Internal Service Funds – Revenues and expenses related to services provided 
to organizations within the District on a cost reimbursement basis are accounted for in the 
internal service fund. The District’s Internal Service Funds are the Workers’ Compensation Fund 
(which is used only to fund remaining claims after self-insurance was discontinued in 2000)  

 Fiduciary Funds- Private purpose trust fund - The District accounts for resources held in a trust or 
custodial capacity for individuals or private organizations. These funds are primarily used for 
scholarships. 

 
Basis of Accounting - Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in 
the accounts and reported in the financial statements. It relates to the timing of the measurements made 
regardless of the measurement focus applied. 
 
As to basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts 
and disbursements, modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma Department of Education as 
follows: 
 

 Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the 
expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

 Vendor obligations due and payable for goods and services received are recorded as a 
reduction of the encumbrance when received and a payable until paid. 

 Warrants/Checks payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
 Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased and reduced when used or 

sold.  
 Capital assets in the government-wide statements are recorded when acquired and depreciated 

over their useful lives. 
 Long-term debt reported in the government-wide statements is recorded when incurred. 
 Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 

obligation is incurred. 
 
This basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which would have required the government-wide financial statements as well as the fiduciary 
fund financial statements to be presented on the accrual basis of accounting.  The fund financial statement 



Lawton Independent School District No. 8 
Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 
 

19 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America would have been presented 
on the modified accrual basis of accounting.  
 
Inventories - Inventories in the general fund consist of expendable supplies held for the District’s use 
and are carried at cost using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are accounted for using the 
consumption method where materials and supplies are recorded as an expenditure when used rather than 
when purchased. 
 
On the government-wide financial statements, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food 
commodities are recorded as revenue when received at fair value at the date of receipt and as an expense 
when used. USDA food commodities are not reported in the governmental funds. The inventory expense 
related to fixed assets available for sale will be recorded when the assets are sold.  
 
Capital Assets - Capital assets purchased or acquired with an original cost of $5,000 or more are reported 
at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Additions, improvements and other capital outlays that 
significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and 
maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation on all assets is provided on the straight-line basis 
over the following estimated useful lives: 
 

 School Buildings                                                                50 years  
 Improvements                                                                    25 years  
 Band Instruments                                                                7 years  
 Computers and Related Equipment                                     5 years 
  Furniture and Equipment                                                   10 years  
 Vehicles                                                                             12 years 

 
As of June 30, 2018, the District has not reported Capital Assets in the statement of Net Position-
regulatory basis. See Note 16. 
 
Compensated Absences – Sick leave is provided to all personnel who work more than 172 contract days 
per year. Employees on 9 or 10-month contracts earn 10 days per year. Employees on 12-month 
contracts earn 12 days per year. The District has a sick leave accumulation incentive program to 
encourage accumulation of sick leave by offering a stipend at time of termination or retirement. The 
stipend is based on a tier system, which pays a different rate per day for each tier, from $5 per day to $20 
per day. The maximum amount of the stipend is $3,000. 
 
Personnel in a full-time position, six or more hours per day, earn vacation time based on years of service. 
Those with less than 4 years of service earn 1 day per month of employment up to a maximum of 10 
days per year and accumulated maximum of 20 days. Those with 4 or more years of service earn 1.5 
days per month of employment up to a maximum of 15 days per year and an accumulated maximum of 
30 days. Upon retirement or termination, the accumulated days are reimbursed at the employee’s 
effective rate of pay. 
 
Budgets and Budgetary Accounting - The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A 



Lawton Independent School District No. 8 
Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Notes to Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 
 

20 

preliminary budget must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year 
beginning the following July 1.  Because a majority of voters of the District approved a permanent levy 
in 2001 for the emergency levy and local support levy, an election to approve the levy is no longer held. 
 
No later than October 1, each board of education shall prepare a financial statement and estimate of 
needs to be filed with the applicable county clerk and the State Department of Education.   Once the 
county excise board has approved the estimate of needs, the board shall adopt a final budget within 45 
days or the second regularly scheduled board meeting.  No later than 15 days prior to adoption of a final 
budget, the board must conduct a public hearing for purposes of taking public comments. The final 
budget may be revised upon approval of the Board of Education in open meeting. 
 
A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Building Fund and the Debt 
Service Fund that includes revenues and expenditures. 
 
Budgets generally assume the expenditure of all available resources. Therefore, when the legal budget is 
prepared, it is assumed these funds will not have a carryover balance to a subsequent year. Program 
revenue received but not spent is restricted and deferred to the subsequent fiscal year. 
 
Encumbrances - Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or 
services. Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 
the expenditures of resources are recorded as expenditures of the applicable funds, is used. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents - The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits, money market 
checking and certificates of deposit, held at an individual bank which are subject to early withdrawal 
penalties no matter what the maturity period, to be cash.  All short-term cash surpluses are maintained in 
a cash pool, the earnings from which are allocated to each fund based on month-end deposit balances. 
State statutes require collateral for deposits in excess of insured amounts. The collateral’s market value 
must exceed the insured deposit. 
 
Investments - The District's investment policies are governed by state statutes. Permissible investments 
include: 

 
1. Direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies 
2. Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the State of Oklahoma is pledged 
3. Certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations and bank and trust companies secured by 
acceptable collateral 
4. Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations that are fully insured 
5. County, municipal and school district direct debt obligations 
6. Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
7. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district 
8. Qualified pooled investment programs

Notes to Financial Statements

Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of 
ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of 
the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for 
submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax 
collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1. 
The second half is due prior to April 1. 
 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 1. Second 
half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If not paid for a 
period of three years or more as of the date such taxes first become due, the property is offered for 
sale. 
 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state 
aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of 
Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information 
accumulated from the districts. Approximately 56% of the District’s revenue comes from state sources. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of 
Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by 
review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when 
the adjustment is made. 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
programs for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the 
fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. 
The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted 
for in the general fund. 
 
Interfund Transfers - During the course of normal operations, the District has transactions between funds 
including expenditures and transfers of resources to provide services, purchase assets and service debt. 
Transactions that are normal and recurring between funds are recorded as transfers. 
 
Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Note 2 -Net Position and Fund Balance 
 
District-Wide Financial Statements – When the District incurs an expense for which it may use either 
restricted or unrestricted Net Position, it uses restricted Net Position first unless unrestricted Net Position 
will have to be returned because they were not used. Net Position on the Statement of Net Position 
include the following:

Net Investment in Capital Assets – The component of net position that reports the difference 
between capital assets less both the accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balance of 
debt, excluding unspent proceeds, that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
improvement of these capital assets. As of June 30, 2018, the balance of Net Investment in 
Capital Assets is the debt related to  capital assets, since the prior year amount of capital assets 
was removed since they did not have records to support balances.  See Note 17 for further 
discussion.  
 
Restricted for Debt Service – The component of net position that reports the amount of funds 
restricted for payment of principal and interest on debt. This amount is restricted by enabling 
legislation and debt covenants. 
 
Restricted for Buildings – The component of net position that reports the excess of property taxes 
and other revenue collected in excess of expenses for operation of the District’s buildings. This 
amount is restricted by enabling legislation. 
 
Restricted for School Organizations – The component of net position that report the assets 
restricted for use by student organizations and extracurricular activities. This amount is restricted 
by regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
 
Restricted for Scholarships – the component of net position that report the assets restricted for 
scholarships. 
 
Restricted for Other – The component of net position that reports the assets restricted for 
payment of sick leave incentive program, outstanding workers’ compensation claims, and 
unemployment claims for employees paid with federal salaries. 
 
Unrestricted – The difference between assets and liabilities that is not reported as restricted for 
any particular purpose. 

 
The government-wide statement of net position reports $7,512,960 of restricted net position. 
 
Governmental Fund Financial Statements – The governmental fund financial statements present fund 
balances based on classifications that comprise a hierarchy that is based primarily on the extent to which 
the District is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in the respective 
governmental funds can be spent. The classifications used in the governmental fund financial statements 
are as follows: 
 

Nonspendable: This classification includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either 
(a) not in spendable form or (b) are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. The 
District has classified inventory as being nonspendable as these items are not expected to be 
converted to cash or are not expected to be converted to cash within the next year. 
 
Restricted: This classification includes amounts for which constraints have been placed on the 
use of the resources either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through a debt covenant),

grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or (b) imposed by law 
through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The District has classified school 
construction expenditures as being restricted because their use is restricted by state statute or 
legislation regarding use of expenditures. Debt service resources are to be used for future 
servicing of the revenue note and are restricted through debt covenants. Other purposes are 
restricted for scholarship purposes from contributors. 
 
Committed: This classification includes amounts that can be used only for specific purposes 
pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. These amounts 
cannot be used for any other purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the 
specified use by taking the same type of action (resolution) that was employed when the funds 
were initially committed. This classification also includes contractual obligations to the extent 
that existing resources have been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual 
requirements. The District has classified school program activities as being committed because 
their use is imposed by the Board of Education regarding use of expenditures. 
 
Assigned: This classification includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be 
used for a specific purpose but are neither restricted nor committed. This intent can be expressed 
by the Board of Education or through the Board of Education delegating this responsibility to 
management through the budgetary process. As of June 30, 2018, the District does not have 
assigned fund balances.  
 
Unassigned: This classification includes the residual fund balance for the General Fund. The 
unassigned classification would also include any negative residual fund balance of any other 
governmental fund that cannot be eliminated by offsetting of assigned fund balance amounts. The 
District has not established a formal stabilization arrangement regarding minimum funding 
requirements. 
 

As of June 30, 2018, fund balances are comprised of the following:

The District would typically use restricted fund balances first, followed by committed resources, and 
then assigned resources, as appropriate opportunities arise, but reserves the right to selectively spend 
unassigned resources first to defer the use of these other classified funds.

Note 3 - Cash and Investments 
 
Deposits – At June 30, 2018, the bank balance of deposits and cash pools was $7,828,043. Custodial 
credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned to it. 
The District’s policy requires collateral for all deposits not covered by Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation insurance. At June 30, 2018, the District was not exposed to custodial credit risk. 
 
Investments - The District participates in an external investment pool, Oklahoma Public School Liquid 
Asset Pool (OLAP).  The plan is sponsored by the Oklahoma State School Boards Association, 
Cooperative Council of Oklahoma School Administration, Organization of Rural Oklahoma Schools and  
the Oklahoma Association of School Business Officials. OLAP is governed through an inter local 
cooperative agreement and the investment advisors and other professionals are competitively selected. 
OLAP reported value and fair market value are equal at June 30, 2018. To receive a copy of the 
Oklahoma Public School Liquid Asset Pool annual audit report, call toll free 1-866-472-6527 or visit 
www.OLAPonline.org. OLAP’s portfolio consists of cash and short-term investments valued at 
amortized cost which approximates fair value. OLAP invest in obligations of the U.S Government, its 
agencies and instrumentalities and repurchase agreements, provided that the underlying collateral 
consists of obligations of the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities and the OLAP 
custodian takes delivery of the collateral. . Total external pool investments at June 30, 2018 are 
$43,748,428  which are shown on the statement of net position as unrestricted $43,700,650 and on the 
statement of fiduciary net position at $47,778.

Investment Maturities (in Years)

 
Credit Risk - Investments – Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to an investment 
will not fulfill its obligations. The District does not have a formal policy limiting its exposure arising 
from concentration of investments. Investments held by the District in investment pools (sweep accounts 
and external investment pools) are considered unclassified as to custodial credit risk because they are not 
evidenced by securities that exist in physical or book entry form. OLAP held securities of $43,748,428 
have Standard & Poor’s ratings of 8.9 percent AA+, 2.0 percent AA-, and 89.1 percent NR. Securities 
with NR rating are bank deposit accounts.  Investments held in the endowment fund  in money market 
mutual funds and federal agencies are rated Aaa by Moody’s.  Investments within the mutual funds are 
rated based on individual holdings of each fund.  The mutual funds as a whole are not rated. 
 
Investment Interest Rate Risk – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely 
affect the fair market value of an investment.  Due to the nature of the District’s external investment

pool and mutual funds, there are no defined maturity dates.  The risk related to investments in the 
endowment fund are shown in the table above. The District does not have a formal policy that limits 
investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses from increasing interest 
rates.

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be 
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by 
the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be 
fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. General obligation bonded debt of the District 
is limited by state law to 10% of the assessed valuation of the District. The legal debt limit at June 30, 
2018 is $43,129,111. 
 
Proceeds of general obligation bond issues are recorded in the bond fund and at least 85% of the 
proceeds are restricted to the use for which they were approved in the bond elections. 
 
The District has entered financing arrangements with Comanche County Educational Facilities 
Authority (see Note 13). These financing arrangements are accounted for as capital leases, since for 
accounting purposes the title transfers at the end of lease term. The leases contain a clause which gives 
the District the ability to terminate the lease agreements at the end of each fiscal year.  
 
The schedule of future minimum lease payments under the capital leases and the present value of the 
net minimum lease payments for years ending June 30, are as follows:

Pledged Revenues  
 
The District has pledged $65,208,647 of future issuances of general obligation bonds to repay 
$55,000,000 plus interest leave revenues bonds with Comanche County Educational Facilities Authority 
(CCEFA). Proceeds from the lease revenues bonds are to be for the construction and placement of 
improvements on real property.  The general obligation bonds of the District will be issued prior to the 
payment due to of lease purchase payments to CCEFA.  One hundred percent of the general obligation 
bonds will be used to pay the lease revenue bond payments and bond issuance costs.  The annual 
payments will start June 1, 2019 and will continue with final payment due to CCEFA on June 1, 2028.  
 
Property tax revenues collected by the District are pledged to repay the District’s General Obligation 
Bonds. As of June 30, 2018, $14,695,000 general obligations were outstanding and $106,845,000 of 
general obligations bonds were authorized but not issued as of June 30, 2018.  Current year had

Note 5 - Employee Retirement System 
 
Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma 
 
Plan Description – The System provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living 
adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries.  The ability to establish and amend 
benefit provisions is the responsibility of the state legislature.  The System issues a publicly available 
financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for the 
employees of the District. The System issues a publically available financial report that can be obtained 
at http://www.ok.gov/trs/. 
 
Benefits Provided – The System provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final 
compensation, age, and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon 
disability and to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O.S. Sec. 17-105 defines all 
retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State 
Legislature. 
 
Contributions – In accordance with Oklahoma Statutes, System members are required to contribute 
7.00% of applicable compensation.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, qualifying employee 
contributions were reduced by a retirement credit of $704,025 provided by Enrolled House Bill 1873 
and paid by the State of Oklahoma as on-behalf payments.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, the 
District had a statutory contribution rate of 9.5% plus 7.80% as a match for salaries funded by federal 
programs.  The contribution requirements of System members and the District are established and may 
be amended by the state legislature.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District contributions to the 
System for were $5,949,341. 
 
The State of Oklahoma, a non-employer contributing entity, provides funds through 5% of the State’s 
sales, use, corporate and individual income taxes collected. The System receives 1% of the cigarette 
taxes collected by the State and 5% of net lottery proceeds collected by the State.  The District’s 
estimated share of these contributions based on their covered payroll for the measurement period was 
$4,093,947. 
 
Pension Liability and Pension Expense  
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability was 
$93,709,621. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total pension liability 
used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date. The 
District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the District’s long-term 
share of the contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating 
school districts, actuarially determined. At June 30, 2017, the District’s proportion was 1.41226594%, 
which decreased 0.00548722 % from the proportion measured as of June 30, 2016.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building 
block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net 
of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges 
are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real 
rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expecting inflation. 
 
The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return for each major 
asset class as of June 30, 2017, are summarized in the following table: 

Asset Class
Target 

Allocation

Long-Term 
Expected Real 
Rate of Return

Fixed Income 23.50% 2.50%
Domestic Equity 38.50% 7.50%
International Equity 19.00% 8.50%
Real Estate 9.00% 4.50%
Alternative Assets 10.00% 6.10%

100.00%  
 
Discount rate –A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability as of June 
30, 2017. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the pension 
plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all 
projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of 
return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine 
the total pension liability. 
 
Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate 
– The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using 
the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability 
would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-
percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

Note 6 - Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) 
 
In addition to the retirement plan described in Note 5, the District participates in the state-administered  
Supplemental Health Insurance Program (OPEB Plan) within Teachers’ Retirement System of 
Oklahoma (the OPEB System), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan 
administered by the Teacher Retirement System (TRS). 



Lawton Independent School District No. 8

Plan Description – The OPEB System pays a monthly health insurance premium supplement for each 
retired member who is enrolled in the health insurance plan provided by the State and Education 
Employees Group Health and Dental Insurance plan or in an insurance program provided by a 
participating education employer who provides health insurance coverage to former employees, 
provided the retired member had at least ten (10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement.  

 
Benefits Provided – All retirees are eligible except for special retirees (as defined) and spouses and 
beneficiaries as long as they have at least 10 years of service.  Retirees who elect such coverage receive 
the smaller of (i) a Medicare supplement benefit, if eligible, or (ii) an amount between $100 and $105 
per month, depending on service and final average compensation. Payments made on the retirees’ behalf 
to the Employees Group Insurance Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, if the 
member continues health coverage under that Plan, or (ii) to the member’s former employer, if the 
member retains health coverage under a plan maintained by the former employer. 
 
Contributions – Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 
contained in State Statute Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do not specify or identify any 
particular contribution source to pay the health insurance subsidy. The cost of the subsidy averages 
0.15% of normal cost, as determined by an actuarial valuation. 
 
Since the District prepares the financials under regulatory basis as required by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, the net OPEB liability (asset) is disclosure only. At June 30, 2018, the 
District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset was $629,789. The net OPEB asset was measured 
as of June 30, 2017, and the total OPEB asset used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by 
an actuarial valuation as of that date. The District’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on a 
projection of the District’s long-term share of the contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the 
projected contributions of all participating school districts, actuarially determined.  
 
At June 30, 2017, the District’s proportion was 1.41226594%, as compared to its proportion share of 
1.41775316% measured as of June 30, 2016. 
 
Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset to changes in the discount rate – 
The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset calculated using the 
discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset would 
be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-
point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

Due to the structure of the OPEB plan, healthcare cost trend rate sensitivity analysis is not meaningful.

Note 7 - Commitments and Contingencies 
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor 
agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the 
applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be 
determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 
The District is a defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect 
on the financial condition of the District. Should a judgment be awarded against the District, it would be 
levied through the District’s sinking fund over a three-year period pursuant to state law.  
  
In exchange for $50, the District entered into a lease with the City of Lawton for use of the original 
Lawton High School building. The lease has a 50 year term commencing fiscal year 2010. The property 
will become the City of Lawton’s at the end of the lease. 
 
The District has outstanding construction and purchase commitments of approximately $4,025,000 to be 
financed from bond funds and $1,524,000 to be financed from sales tax fund. 
 
Note 8 - Risk Management 
 
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions and natural disasters for which the District carries commercial insurance. 
There have been no significant reductions in coverage from the prior year and settlements have not 
exceeded coverage in the past three years. 
 
 
Note 9 - Interfund transactions

Note 15 – New GASB Standards   
 
GASB Statement No.75, Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions establishes standards for

specified criteria and for employers whose employees are provided with defined contribution OPEB.

Note 16 – Restatement of Beginning Balances  
 
Due the lack of adequate records for capital assets for the year ended June 30, 2018, the capital assets 
have been removed from the financial statements. This has resulted in a restatement of capital assets, net 
position on the statement of net position regulatory basis and beginning net position on the government 
activities statement of activities.  The restatement has resulted in a decrease of capital assets, and net 
position of $110,874,793. The remaining balance of $3,944,764 of invested in capital assets, was the 
portion related to debt as of June 30, 2017.   The portion of debt related to capital assets in fiscal year

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT 
AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
To the Board of Education 
Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Lawton, Oklahoma 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States the financial statements of the governmental 
activities,  each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Lawton Independent 
School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise, Lawton Independent School 
District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report 
thereon dated April 29, 2019. Our report included an adverse opinion on U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles because the District prepares its financial statements on a prescribed regulatory 
basis of accounting. Our report included a qualified regulatory basis opinion on governmental activities 
and unmodified regulatory basis opinion on major funds and aggregate remaining funds.   
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Lawton Independent 
School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s  internal control over financial reporting 
(internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, 
Oklahoma’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 
Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s internal control. 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention 
by those charged with governance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM 

AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVERCOMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM 
GUIDANCE 

 
 
To the Board of Education 
Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma 
Lawton, Oklahoma 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement 
that could have a direct and material effect on each of Lawton Independent School District No. 8, 
Comanche County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Lawton 
Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs are 
identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and 
questioned costs. 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the federal statutes, regulations and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Lawton Independent School 
District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the 
United States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  
Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred 
to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Lawton Independent School District No. 8, 
Comanche County, Oklahoma’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our qualified and unmodified opinions on 
compliance for each major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination 
of Lawton Independent School District No. 8, Comanche County, Oklahoma’s compliance.

Section II – Financial Statement Findings 
 
2018-001  Financial Reporting 
Condition:  Material adjustments related to debt and long term liabilities were 

necessary to prepare the financial statements.  In addition, the District 
was not able to provide supporting documentation to report capital assets 
as required by the State Department of Education guidelines.  

Criteria:   Generally accepted auditing standards require  the financial statements to 
be a product of the financial reporting system of the entity being audited. 
The government should be able to provide evidence that a sound 
financial reporting system is in place to provide reasonable assurance 
that management is able to prepare the financial statements in conformity 
with the financial reporting framework.   

Cause: Management has transitioned and a new financial process has not been 
implemented.   

Effect:  Potential that a material misstatement of the government’s financial 
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The 
District was not able to demonstrate that a financial reporting system was 
in place at a sufficient level to assess the adequacy. An audit scope 
limitation was necessary due to a material financial asset that could not 
be audited.   

Recommendation: We recommend that the District evaluate its financial reporting system. 
The system needs to provide documentation to evaluate its adequacy and 
minimize the likelihood of material audit adjustments.  

Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: The District’s financial reporting system was put in place by the previous 

finance director. The system that was setup in the past was not conducive 
to use by the current staff. Changes in the processes in the finance 
department have been implemented.  The software vendor has conducted 
training and is reevaluating the processes and procedures used. Ongoing 
changes should address efficiency and effectiveness of the finance 
department and minimize control issues. 

 
2018-002  Negative Fund Balance  
Condition:  Gifts Fund 81 has negative fund balance of $5,500 
Criteria:   Oklahoma Statutes Title 70-5-157 B.1states: It shall be unlawful for any 

officer or employee of the school district in any budget year, to create or 
authorize creation of a deficit in any fund.   

Cause: Checks issued exceed available resources.

Effect:  Risk of overspending funds. 
Recommendation: We recommend that the District evaluate monitoring procedures of funds 

to ensure they have adequate resources before issuing checks.   
Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: Reporting issues were encountered when uploading data to the State 

Department of Education. District records indicated that the fund had a 
positive balance. The Finance department is structured to ensure 
monitoring procedures of all accounts are adhered to so that the 
possibility of a negative balance is avoided. 

Section III – Federal Award Findings and Questioned Costs 
 
2018-003     Preparation of Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA)  
 
Condition:  The schedule of expenditures of federal awards was not prepared by the auditee. 

Controls were not operating to ensure federal expenditures were properly 
reconciled to federal revenues.  

  
Criteria:  2 CFR 200.510b Schedule of expenditures of federal awards: the auditee must 

prepare a schedule of expenditures of federal awards for the period covered by 
the auditee’s financial statements which must include the total federal awards 
expended as determined in accordance with §200.502.    

 
Context: During review of federal expenditures, material adjustments were required to 

properly report expenditures on the schedule of expenditures of federal awards 
when reconciled with federal revenues received and requested.    

 
Cause:  Due to change in management at year end, final reconciliation of federal 

expenditures to federal revenues was not completed.  The financial reporting 
process was unable to demonstrate that the auditee could prepare the SEFA.   

 
Effect:   Risk of material misstatements of federal expenditures    
 
Recommendation:  We recommend that the District evaluates its financial reporting system to 

include adequate controls over the accumulation of federal awards expended for 
the preparation of the SEFA.   

 
Views of Responsible  
Officials And Planned  
Corrective Action: The District’s financial reporting system has been modified to ensure that the 

reports needed to reconcile expenditures to that of all Federal grants can be 
prepared to remove any risk of material misstatement. Personnel responsible for
