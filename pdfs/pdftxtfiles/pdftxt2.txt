REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
AND SUPPLEMENTARY SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL AWARDS 

 
 
Board of Trustees 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University 
 
We have audited the accompanying statement of financial position of Oklahoma Wesleyan 
University (a nonprofit organization) which comprise the statement of financial position as of 
June 30, 2018, and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the year then ended, 
and the related notes to the financial statements. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; 
this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers the internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion. 



 

 

Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of Oklahoma Wesleyan University as of June 30, 2018, and the changes 
in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole.  The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 
U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is presented for purposes of additional 
analysis, and is not a required part of the basic financial statements.  Such information is the 
responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements.  The information has been 
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the 
financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, the information is 
fairly stated, in all material respects in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated 
October 3, 2018, on our consideration of Oklahoma Wesleyan University’s internal control 
over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to 
describe the scope of our testing of internal controls over financial reporting and compliance and 
the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial 
reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance 
with Government Auditing Standards in considering Oklahoma Wesleyan University’s internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance.

POLICIES 
 
Organization - Oklahoma Wesleyan University (the University) is an educational 
institution for The Wesleyan Church of the United States and Canada (the Church) and is 
administered by the Church through a Board of Trustees nominated by representatives of 
the Church and elected by the General Board of Administration of the Church. 
 
A predecessor college, Miltonvale Wesleyan College (Miltonvale), maintains its 
corporate identity with very limited activity.  The activity of Miltonvale is included in 
financial statements of the University since its sole purpose is to support the University, 
and the University Board of Trustees controls its activities. 
 
The donor base of the University consists primarily of citizens of the United States of 
America.  Students attending the University are primarily from the states of Oklahoma 
and Kansas. 
 
Accounts Receivable – Accounts receivable consists primarily of student accounts.  
However, included in the accounts receivable are amounts due from faculty and staff for 
transition and education allowances.  Management provides an allowance each year for 
estimated losses based on prior years’ experience and a review of existing accounts.  
Charges accumulate on outstanding balances after sixty days from the date of the 
student’s departure from the University and are reflected as interest earned under 
investment income in the Statement of Activities.  The University reserves the right to 
place receivables on non-accrual status at the discretion of the Student Accounts Office.  
Accounts are sent to an outside collections agency after six months of non-payment and 
reflected as a write-off.  Amounts received after assignment are considered a recovery of 
bad debt expense.  Within thirty days of assignment, the University reserves the right to 
review and withdraw the account.  The University performs on-going evaluations of its 
receivables and does not require any collateral on outstanding balances. 
 
Accounts receivable balances were as follow: 
 
 Students $  407,919 
 Faculty and staff  418,884

POLICIES (continued) 
 
Contributions - The University reports contributions in accordance with FASB ASC 
958-605.  Accordingly, contributions received are recorded as unrestricted, temporarily 
restricted, or permanently restricted support depending on the existence and/or nature of 
any donor restrictions.  All donor-restricted support is reported as an increase in 
temporarily or permanently restricted net assets, depending on the nature of the 
restriction.  When a restriction expires, temporarily restricted net assets are released and 
reclassified to unrestricted net assets. 
 
Contributions of land, buildings, equipment and other long-lived assets are recorded at 
fair value at the date of donation.  These donations are reported as unrestricted revenue 
and net assets unless explicit donor stipulations specify how such assets must be used, in 
which case the gifts are reported as temporarily or permanently restricted revenue and net 
assets.  Absent explicit donor stipulations for the time long-lived assets must be held, 
expirations of restrictions resulting in reclassification of temporarily restricted net assets 
as unrestricted net assets are reported when the long-lived assets are placed in service. 
 
Unconditional contributions expected to be collected within one year are reported at their 
net realizable value.  Unconditional contributions expected to be collected in future years 
are reported at the present value of estimated future cash flows. 
 
Donated Services - A substantial number of volunteers donate significant time to the 
University.  These donated services were not recognized in the financial statements 
because they did not meet the criteria for recognition under FASB ASC 958-605. 
 
Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, gains, losses and other 
changes in net assets during the period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES (continued) 

 
Income Taxes - The University has been declared a tax-exempt organization under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code as a part of the Church, except for taxes, 
if any, on unrelated business income.  In addition, the University is classified as an 
organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a)(1). 
 
The University has adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10 as it might apply to 
financial transactions.  The University's policy is to record a liability for any tax position 
that is beneficial, including any related interest and penalties, when it is more likely than 
not the position taken by management with respect to the transaction or class of 
transactions will be overturned by a taxing authority upon examination.  Management 
believes there are no such positions as of June 30, 2018 and, accordingly, no liability has 
been accrued. 
 
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out), or market.  
They consist primarily of office supplies and promotional materials. 
 
Investments - Investments in marketable securities with readily determinable fair values 
and all investments in debt securities are stated at fair value, which is determined 
primarily from quoted market prices.  Non-marketable investments are valued at the 
lower of cost (or fair value at date of donation in the case of gifts) or market value.  
Interest and dividends, together with realized and unrealized gains and losses, are 
reflected in the Statement of Activities as unrestricted, temporarily restricted or 
permanently restricted investment return based upon the existence and nature of any 
donor or legally imposed restrictions.  The University does not require collateral on its 
investments and considers them fully at risk.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING 
POLICIES (continued) 
 
Property and Equipment - Land, buildings, and equipment additions after 1966 are 
stated at cost at date of acquisition or fair value at date of donation in the case of gifts.  
The valuation of certain land and buildings acquired prior to 1966 is based on values 
established by an independent appraisal in 1965.  The University capitalizes all 
expenditures for property and equipment over a nominal amount.  Depreciation is 
provided over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets on a straight-line basis.  
Useful lives for depreciation are as follows: 
 

Land improvements 15 years 
Buildings 20 - 50 years 
Building improvements 10 years 
Equipment and vehicles 5 - 10 years 
Library books 10 years 
Software 3 years 
 

Reclassifications - Certain amounts in the prior year financial statements have been 
reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current-year financial statements. 

 
Subsequent Events - Management has evaluated events and transactions that have 
occurred since June 30, 2018 and reflected their effects, if any, in these financial 
statements through October 3, 2018, the date the financial statements were available to be 
issued. 

 
Temporarily and Permanently Restricted Net Assets - Temporarily restricted net 
assets are those whose use by the University has been limited by donors to a specific time 
period or purpose.  When a donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time 
restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished, temporarily restricted net assets 
are reclassified to unrestricted net assets and reported in the Statement of Activities as net 
assets released from restrictions. 
 
Permanently restricted net assets, principally restricted investments and amounts due 
from the current unrestricted funds, have been restricted by donors to be maintained by 
the University in perpetuity.  Interest and dividends from permanently restricted 
investments are credited to unrestricted net assets unless donor stipulations restrict such 
earnings.

2. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
 

The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be 
received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).  Accordingly, the fair value 
hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
(Level 3).  The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels 
below: 

 
 Level 1 - inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices in active independent 

markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
 Level 2 - inputs are directly or indirectly observable estimates from quotes for 

similar but not identical assets and liabilities, market trades for identical assets not 
actively traded or other external independent means; 

 Level 3 - inputs are unobservable and reflect assumptions on the part of the 
reporting entity. 

 
The following table sets forth information about the level within the fair value hierarchy 
at which the University's financial assets and liabilities are measured on a recurring basis 
at June 30, 2018:

4. STUDENT NOTES RECEIVABLE 
 
The University makes uncollateralized loans to students based on financial need.  Student 
loans are funded through Federal government loan programs.  At June 30, 2018, student 
loans represented 1.6% of total assets. 
 
At June 30, student notes consisted of the following: 
 
 Federal government programs   $ 878,701 
 Less allowance for doubtful accounts    (206,663) 
 

 Total Student Notes Receivable  $ 672,038 
 

The University participates in the Perkins federal revolving loan program.  The loans 
bear interest at 5 percent when they go into repayment status.  The availability of funds 
for loans under the program is dependent on reimbursements to the pool from repayments 
on outstanding loans.  Funds advanced by the Federal government of $508,970 at June 
30, 2018 are ultimately refundable to the government and are classified as liabilities in 
the Statement of Financial Position.  Outstanding loans cancelled under the program 
result in a reduction of the funds available for loan and a decrease in the liability to the 
government.  At June 30, 2018, the following amounts were past due under student loan 
programs: 
 
   1 – 60 days  61 – 90 days  91+ days   Total past 
   past due   past due   past due   due  
June 30, 2018 $ 3,643 $ 16,275 $ 238,054 $ 257,972 

 
Allowances for doubtful accounts are established based on prior collection experience 
and current economic factors which, in management’s judgment, could influence the 
ability of loan recipients to repay the amounts per the loan terms.

7. BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN TRUST 
 

The University has a beneficial interest in a trust.  The terms of the trust are 5% of the 
fair value is paid to the beneficiaries annually.  The value was determined based on the 
University's apportionment of the fair value of the assets that are held by the trust. 

 
 

8. ENDOWMENTS 
 

The University's endowments consist of several individual funds established for a variety 
of purposes.  Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds 
designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments.  As required by 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), net 
assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of 
Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or 
absence of donor-imposed restrictions. 

 
Interpretation of Relevant Law 
 
The Board of Trustees of the University has interpreted the Oklahoma Uniform Prudent 
Management of Institutional Funds Act (OKUPMIFA) as requiring the preservation of 
the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment 
funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary.  As a result of this interpretation, 
the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts 
donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the 
permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in 
accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the 
accumulation is added to the fund.  The remaining portion of the donor-restricted 
endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as 
temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by 
the University in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by 
OKUPMIFA.  In accordance with OKUPMIFA, the University considers the following 
factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted 
endowment funds: 
 

 The duration and preservation of the fund. 
 The purposes of the University and the donor-restricted endowment fund. 
 General economic conditions. 
 The possible effect of inflation and deflation. 
 The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments. 
 Other resources of the University. 
 The investment policies of the University.

8. ENDOWMENTS (continued) 
 

The University has a spending policy based on eighty percent of the average return of the 
five prior years.  In establishing this policy, the University considered the long-term 
expected investment return on its endowment.  Accordingly, over the long term, the 
University expects the current spending policy to allow its general endowment fund to 
grow at an average of two percent annually.  This is consistent with the University's 
objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets as well as to provide 
additional real growth through investment return. 
 
To achieve that objective, the University has adopted an investment policy that attempts 
to maximize total return consistent with an acceptable level of risk.  Endowment assets 
are invested in a well-diversified asset mix, which includes money market, fixed income 
and equity securities, which is intended to result in a consistent inflation-protected rate of 
return that has sufficient liquidity to make an annual distribution while growing the fund 
if possible.  Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount.  Investment risk 
is measured in terms of the total endowment fund; investment assets and allocation 
between asset classes and strategies are managed to not expose the fund to unacceptable 
levels of risk.

ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (Topic 606), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to 
which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to 
customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. 
GAAP when it becomes effective.  The standard permits the use of either the 
retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. 
 
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (Topic 606), which deferred the effective date of the new revenue recognition 
standard for one year.  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after 
December 15, 2018.  Early application is permitted.

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-08, Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958); 
Clarifying the Scope and Accounting Guidance for Contributions Received and 
Contributions Made, to clarify and improve the scope and the accounting guidance for 
contributions received and contributions made. The amendments in this ASU are to be 
applied on a modified prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. For 
transactions in which the entity serves as the resource recipient, the amendments should 
be applied for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. For transactions in which 
the entity serves as the resource provider, the amendments should be applied for fiscal 
years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. 
 
ASU 2016-02, Leases 
 
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase 
transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and 
lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing 
arrangements.  The amendments in this ASU are to be applied using a modified 
retrospective approach.  The amendments are effective for annual financial statements 
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. 
 
The University is evaluating the effect that these standards will have on its financial 
statements and related disclosures.

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN  

AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN  
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
 
Board of Trustees 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University (a nonprofit organization) which comprise the statement of 
financial position as of June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have 
issued our report thereon dated October 3, 2018. 
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Oklahoma 
Wesleyan University’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine 
the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our 
opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of Oklahoma Wesleyan University’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the University's internal control over financial 
reporting. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to 
prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 



 

 

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Oklahoma Wesleyan University’s 
financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with 
certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with 
which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement 
amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 
objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our 
tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported 
under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the University's internal control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit 
preformed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the University's 
internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other 
purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR 
EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 

COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
Board of Trustees 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited Oklahoma Wesleyan University's compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and 
material effect on each of Oklahoma Wesleyan University's major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018.  Oklahoma Wesleyan University's major federal programs are 
identified in the summary of auditors’ results section of the accompanying schedule of findings 
and questioned costs. 
 
Management's Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, 
and grants applicable to its federal program. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Oklahoma Wesleyan 
University's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  
Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform our audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program 
occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Oklahoma Wesleyan 
University's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each 
major federal program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination on 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University's compliance. 



 

 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion Oklahoma Wesleyan University complied, in all material respects, with the 
types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect 
on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Other Matters 
 
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance, which are required 
to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items Findings 2018-001 through 
2018-006. 
 
Oklahoma Wesleyan University's response to the noncompliance findings identified in our 
audit is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  Oklahoma 
Wesleyan University's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. 
 
Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
 
Management of Oklahoma Wesleyan University is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we 
considered Oklahoma Wesleyan University's internal control over compliance with the types 
of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Oklahoma Wesleyan 
University’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing 
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal 
control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on 
a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control 
over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in 
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal 
control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies  We did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material 
weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of 
our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the 
requirements of the Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, it is not suitable for any other purpose.

FINDING 2018-004 – Verification (continued) 
 
Cause: 
 
For the first student, the total taxes paid line was used instead of the U.S. Income Tax line on the 
tax transcript. The second student was included as a member of the household, and child support 
paid for the same student was deducted. 
 
Possible Asserted Effect: 
 
The incorrect EFC was used to determine the amount of aid the students in question qualified to 
receive. Pell was over awarded by $100 and $1,900 for the first and second student, respectively. 
 
Repeat Finding: 
 
A similar finding was reported in the prior year as Finding 2017-005. 
 
Statistical Sampling: 
 
The sample was not intended to be, and was not, a statistically valid sample. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
The Financial Aid Director should make the required changes to the ISIR input data, and 
recalculate the EFC, and determine the amount of aid the students were eligible to receive. In 
total, $1,900 of Federal Pell Grant Funds should be returned to the Department of Education. 
 
Management Response: 
 
The Financial Aid Director updated the students’ information, recalculated the EFC, and 
determined the amount of aid the students were eligible to receive. In total, $1,900 of Federal 
Pell Grant Funds were returned in August 2018.

Student Aid 
 
Pass through Entity: Not applicable 
 
Program Name: Federal Direct Student Loan Program 
  
CFDA# and Program Expenditures: 84.268 ($11,224,159) 
  
Award Number: P268K182030 
 
Federal Award Year: July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 
 
Questioned Costs: $113 (84.268 Unsubsidized Direct Loan Funds) 
 
Condition Found: 
 
The incorrect number of days in the semester and the number of days completed by a student 
were used in an R2T4 calculation for one of the twenty-five students sampled. Therefore, the 
R2T4 calculation and the amount of aid returned to the Department of Education was incorrect. 
 
Criteria: 
 
The number of days in the semester is calculated by counting the number of days in the semester 
less any breaks of four or more days. 
 
Cause: 
 
The student was enrolling in the nontraditional degree program which is structured in modules. 
The student was enrolled in multiple modules with differing beginning and ending dates. This 
made it difficult to calculate the number of days in the semester and the number of days the 
student completed. 
 
Possible Asserted Effect: 
 
The number of days in the semester and the number of days completed by the student used in the 
R2T4 calculation were incorrect. When the correct number of days are used, an additional $113 
of Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans is due to the Department of Education.

FINDING 2018-006 – R2T4 Calculation (continued) 
 
Repeat Finding: 
 
A similar finding was reported in the prior year as Finding 2017-001 
 
Statistical Sampling: 
 
The sample was not intended to be, and was not, a statistically valid sample. 
 
Recommendation: 
 
The Student Financial Director should determine the correct number of days in the semester and 
the number of days completed by the student in question. The R2T4 should be recalculated. An 
additional $113 Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans should be returned to the Department of 
Education. 
 
Management Response: 
 
The Student Financial Aid Director manually recalculated the number of days in the semester 
and the number of days completed by the student in question. The R2T4 was recalculated. An 
additional $113 of Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan funds was returned to the Department of 
Education in November 2018.

Section IV - Prior Year Findings 
 

 
FINDING 2017-001 – R2T4 Calculations 
 
Condition 
 
The incorrect number of days in the semester was used for all of the R2T4s completed for the 
non-traditional students.  This error was identified by the Director of Student Financial Aid 
before the audit began.  Three students in our compliance testing had incorrect R2T4s.  For these 
three students, an additional $27 of unsubsidized federal direct loan funds is due to the 
Department of Education.  We tested an additional twenty-five R2T4s and found six additional 
calculation errors.  For these six students, a total of $1,778 of unsubsidized loan funds and $138 
of subsidized loan funds is due to the Department of Education, and $102 of Pell Grant Funds is 
due to the Department of Education.  The remaining R2T4s were recalculated by the Director of 
Financial Aid. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The Director of Financial Aid had identified an issue, notified us, and was in the process of 
auditing all non-traditional students prior to our audit.  Based on her recommendation, the R2T4s 
should be reviewed and recalculated for the non-traditional students.  A total of $1,805 of 
unsubsidized loan funds, $138 of subsidized loan funds and $102 of Pell grant funds should be 
returned. Our review of the R2T4s after the institution’s internal audit identified no errors. 
 
Current Status 
 
The R2T4s were reviewed and recalculated for the non-traditional students.  A total of $1,805 of 
unsubsidized loan funds, $138 of subsidized loan funds, and $102 of Pell grant funds were 
returned. See Finding 2018-006 for a finding related to R2T4 calculations in the current year. 
 
 
FINDING 2017-002 – Subsidized Loan Eligibility 
 
Condition 
 
The subsidized loan amount awarded was incorrect for one of the students tested.  The student 
had a need of $4,686, which made the student eligible for subsidized loans.  Due to an error in 
the “need” calculation, the student was only awarded unsubsidized loan funds.

AUDITORS’ COMMENTS ON AUDIT 
RESOLUTION MATTERS RELATING TO THE SFA PROGRAMS 

Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 

Section IV - Prior Year Findings (continued) 
 

Recommendation 
 
The University should recalculate the student’s need and adjust the subsidized loan allocation.  
The subsidized loan amount should be $4,686.  The financial aid office should improve 
procedures to ensure that aggregate loan limits are verified before awarding aid. 
 
Current Status 
 
$4,686 was reallocated to subsidized loans. See Finding 2018-002 for a similar finding in the 
current year. 
 
 
FINDING 2017-003 – Exit Interview 
 
Condition 
 
A Federal Direct Loan exit interview was not sent within thirty days of withdrawing or dropping 
below half-time enrollment for one of the students selected for testing.  The student withdrew 
during the semester and the financial aid office overlooked sending the exit interview to the 
student. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The University should improve procedures to ensure that an exit interview is completed when a 
student withdraws from the University.  The financial aid office should send the exit interview to 
the student in question. 
 
Current Status 
 
An exit interview was sent to the student in question in June 2017. See Finding 2018-005 for a 
similar finding in the current year.

FINDING 2017-004 – Authorization to Hold Credit Balances 
 
Condition 
 
For one student in our sample, the University held a credit balance for longer than fourteen days 
without written authorization. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The University should improve procedures to ensure that credit balances are refunded timely.  
The credit balance was returned to the student before the audit began. 
 
Current Status 
 
The credit balance was returned to the student before the audit began. See Finding 2018-003 for 
a similar finding in the current year. 
 
 
FINDING 2016-005 – Verification 
 
Condition 
 
The student in question completed the verification form. A note from a phone call with the 
student stated there were three family members and one was in College.  The ISIR shows that 
two family members were in College.  The ISIR was not updated with the information received 
during the verification process.  The student received $200 of Pell grant funds that the student 
was not eligible to receive. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The financial aid office should complete the verification process for the student and make the 
necessary changes to the ISIR information.  $200 of Pell Grant funds should be returned to the 
Department of Education for the second student in question. 
 
Current Status 
 
$200 of Federal Pell Grant Funds were returned to the Department of Education in August 2017. 
See Finding 2018-004 for a similar finding in the current year.

Section IV - Prior Year Findings (continued) 
 
 
FINDING 2017-006 – TEACH Grant Eligibility 
 
Condition 
 
A student pre-registered for the education program.  During the final registration process, the 
student changed to a nursing major and began taking courses to fulfill the nursing graduation 
requirements.  The change in majors was not communicated to the financial aid office.  $1,864 in 
TEACH Grant Funds were disbursed to the student.  The student was not enrolled in a TEACH 
Grant eligible program and, therefore, was not eligible to receive the $1,864 of Teach Grant 
Funds. 
 
Recommendation 
 
The $1,864 of TEACH Grant Funds should be returned to the Department of Education.  The 
registrar and academic offices should report major declaration or degree program changes to the 
financial aid office. 
 
Current Status 
 
$1,864 of TEACH Grant Funds were returned in August 2017. There was not a similar finding in 
the current year.
