INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

To the Board of Education  
Colcord Public School, I-4 
Colcord, Oklahoma 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements – regulatory basis of the 
Colcord School District No. I-4 (the School), Delaware County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 
2018, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education as 
described in Note 1, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the State of Oklahoma; this includes determining 
that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the financial statements in the 
circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable 
to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement.  

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my adverse and 
qualified audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by the School on the basis of the financial reporting 
regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting 
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 
1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America, although not reasonably determinable, 
are presumed to be material.

1



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles paragraph, the financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in  
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of 
the School, as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and, where applicable, cash 
flows thereof for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is a departure 
from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education noted 
above. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the omission of the general fixed asset account group, the combined financial 
statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund 
balances arising from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of the School as of June 30, 
2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered, of each fund type, for the year then ended, 
on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 

Other Matters 

Other information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial statements 
within the combined financial statements. The combining statements-regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in 
the table of contents, under other supplementary information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are 
not a required part of the combined financial statements of the District. Also, the accompanying schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the financial statements. 

The combining statements-regulatory basis and the other supplementary information, including the schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly 
to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial statements-regulatory basis. Such 
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account 
group financial statements within the combined financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records 
used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In my 
opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis and the other supplementary information, including the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined 
financial statements-regulatory basis taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated December 6, 2018, on my 
consideration of the School's internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to 
describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that 
testing and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is 
an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School’s 
internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

COLCORD SCHOOL DISTRICT No. I-4 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – REGULATORY BASIS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 
 
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The financial statements of the Colcord Public School District No. I-4 (the "District") have been prepared on a 
regulatory basis of accounting, which is an other comprehensive basis of accounting than generally accepted accounting 
principles.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present financial position and 
results of operations in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  The accounting policies are 
prescribed by the Oklahoma Department of Education and conform to the system of accounting authorized by the State 
of Oklahoma.  The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies: 
 
A. Reporting Entity 
 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is 
a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the public school system of 
Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on State 
of Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code 
contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The appointed 
superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  The Board, constituting an on-going entity, is 
the level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public elementary 
and secondary school education within the jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District. The District 
receives funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of 
these funding source entities. The District is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as 
defined in Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since 
Board members are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate 
management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal 
matters. 
 
In evaluating how to define the district, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered all potential 
component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was made by applying the 
criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The basic -- but not the only --criterion 
for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body's ability to exercise oversight 
responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of 
the ability to exercise oversight responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the 
designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A 
second criterion used in evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion 
involves considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted 
within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. A third criterion used to 
evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special 
financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities. Based upon the 
application of these criteria, there are no potential component units included in the District's reporting entity. 
 
 
B. Measurement Focus 
 
The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its operations. Fund 
accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial management by segregating transactions 
related to certain district functions or activities. 

7



  

 
A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account group, on the other hand, is a 
financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded in the 
funds because they do not directly affect net expendable available financial resources. 
 
Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided 
into separate "fund types." 
 
Governmental Fund Types 
 
Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, including the collection and 
disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets 
(capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 
 
General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to be accounted 
for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local property taxes and state funding under the 
Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the 
schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on 
bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for 
specific programs. 
 
Special Revenue Fund - The  first special revenue fund is the District's Building Fund. The Building fund consists of 
monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for 
purchasing furniture and equipment. 
 
The second special revenue fund is the Child Nutrition Fund, a special revenue fund used to account for monies derived 
from federal and state reimbursement and local food service collection. 
 
Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund  is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account for the accumulation of 
financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal,  
interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and 
interest earnings from temporary investments. 
 
Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's Bond Fund and is used to account for the proceeds of 
bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, 
renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment. 
 
Proprietary Fund Types 
 
Any proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in the private sector, where the 
determination of net income is necessary or useful to sound financial administration. Goods or services from such 
activities can be provided either to outside parties (enterprise funds) or to other departments or agencies primarily 
within the District (internal service funds).  The District does not have any proprietary funds. 
 
 
Fiduciary Fund Types 
 
Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other governments, or on 
behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms of a formal trust agreement, either 
a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund is used. The terms "nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to 
whether or not the District is under an obligation to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to 
account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of 
operations. 

8



  

 
Agency Fund - The Agency fund is the School Activities fund which is used to account for monies collected principally 
through fund-raising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The administration is responsible, under the 
authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds. 
 
Account groups  
Are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish accounting control over long-term 
debt and general fixed assets not accounted for in proprietary funds. 
 
General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for all long-term debt of the 
District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund and the amount to be provided in future years 
to complete retirement of the debt principal. It is also used to account for liabilities for compensated absences and early 
retirement incentives which are to be paid from funds provided in future years. 
 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, plant and equipment of 
the school district.  The district does not maintain a record of its general fixed assets, and accordingly, a statement 
of general fixed assets, required by generally accepted accounting principles, is not included in the financial 
statements.  Land, buildings, nonstructural improvements, and all other physical assets in all funds are considered 
expenditures in the year of acquisition and are not recorded as assets for financial statement purposes.  
 
Memorandum Only - Total Column 
 
The total column on the financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate that it is presented only 
to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial position, results of operations or cash 
flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Neither is such data comparable to a 
consolidation. Interfund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data. 
 
C. Basis of Accounting 
 
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form of presentation used by state and 
local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements – 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local Governments. This format significantly differs from 
that required by GASB 34. 
 
The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements modified as 
required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as follows: 
 

a. Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the expenditure of 
monies are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

b. Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased. 
c. Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as assets. 
d. Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
e. Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
f. Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the obligation is 

incurred. 
g. A General Fixed Asset Account Group is required or expected by the Department of Education and is 

presented in such an account group but is not depreciated. 
h. Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is not required to be present. 

 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when they are 
earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental 
fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

9



 

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounts and reported in the 
financial statements. Basis of accounting relates to the timing of measurements made, regardless of the 
measurement focus applied. 

All governmental type funds are accounted for using the Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting. Revenues are 
recognized when they are received rather than earned. Under the Statutory basis of accounting, expenditures are 
generally recognized when encumbered/reserved rather than at the time the related fund liability is incurred, 
Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. These practices differ from generally 
accepted accounting principles.  

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must be submitted to the 
Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1. If the preliminary budget 
requires an additional levy, the District must hold an election on the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy. 
If the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. If an election is held and 
the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. If voters reject the additional taxes, 
the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue Funds (Building 
Fund and Child Nutrition Fund) and the Debt Service Fund, that includes revenues and expenditures. 

The 2017-18 Estimate of Needs was approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk.  The 
Estimate of Needs was approved by the excise board and the requested levies were made. 

E. Encumbrances

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services. Encumbrance 
accounting -- under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the 
applicable fund -- is utilized in all governmental funds of the District. Appropriations not used or encumbered lapse 
at the end of the year. 

F. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid 
investments, with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies with 
maturities greater than three months when purchased. All investments are recorded at cost, which approximates 
market value.  

 

10



 

  

Inventories – Purchases for inventory items are considered expenditures when the items are encumbered. 

Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment - The General Fixed Asset Account Group is not presented.  
The amount that should be recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group is not known. 

Compensated Absences – Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated with 
expendable available financial resources has not been reported as an expenditure or a fund liability of the 
governmental fund that will pay it since the combined financial statements have been prepared on the 
regulatory basis of accounting. Vested accumulated rights to receive sick pay benefits have not been reported in 
the general long-term debt account group since the combined financial statements have been prepared on the 
regulatory basis of accounting. These practices differ from generally accepted accounting principles in the 
United States of America. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due, or when resources 
have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For other long-term 
obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a 
fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general 
long-term debt account group.  

Fund Balance - Fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase order, legal contracts, and 
outstanding warrants. 

In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances. The 
hierarchy is based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed upon use of resources for 
specific purposes versus availability of appropriation. An important distinction that is made in 
reporting fund balance is between amounts that are considered nonspendable (i.e., fund balance 
associated with assets that are not in spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions 
of loans and notes receivable, or items that are legally required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a 
permanent fund) and those that are spendable (such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or 
receivables). 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, 
assigned or unassigned, as appropriate. 

• Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors
(such as debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments;
or by law, through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

• Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific purposes by formal action
of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority.  Such amounts are not subject to legal
enforceability (like restricted amounts),but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government
removes or changes the limitation by taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment.  The
School Board is the highest level of decision-making authority of the School District.

• Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes but are
neither restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-
level body or official who the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for

11



  

specific purposes. Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable amounts (except negative 
balances) that are reported in governmental funds other than the general fund that are neither restricted nor 
committed, and amounts in the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance 
with the provisions of the standard. 
 
• Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. It represents the amounts that 
have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to 
specific purposes within the general fund. 
 
G. Revenue, Expenses and Expenditures 
 

Property Tax Revenues and Other Local Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy 
property taxes which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The 
County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the County Excise Board, extends 
the tax levies on the roll for submission to the County Treasurer prior to October 1. The County 
Treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of 
taxes is due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1. If the first payment is not made 
timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half taxes become delinquent on 
April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If not paid by the following October 1, the 
property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem the property 
by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the 
purchaser is issued a deed to the property. No provision has been made for uncollected taxes, as all 
taxes deemed collectable. Other local sources of revenues include tuition, fees, rental, disposals, 
commissions, and reimbursements. 
 
Intermediate Revenues -Revenue from intermediate source is the amount of money from funds 
collected by an intermediate administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the district and 
the state and distributed to districts in amounts that differ in proportion to those which were 
collected within such systems. 
 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid formula 
under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the 
allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may 
adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally, such 
adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State Board of 
Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the program for which the 
money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward 
into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of Education 
requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 
 
Federal Revenues - Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form 
of operating grants or entitlements. An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific 
purpose, activity or facility. A grant may be received either directly from the federal government 
or indirectly as a pass through from another government, such as the state. Entitlement is the 
amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant to an allocation formula contained in 

12



 

applicable statutes. The majority of the federal revenues received by the District are apportioned 
to the general fund. The District maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the federal revenues 
received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

Non-Monetary Transactions — The District receives commodities from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. The value of these commodities has been included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal 
wards; however, they have not been reflected in the combined financial statements as either revenue or 
expense since they are not reported under the regulatory basis of accounting. 

Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or expenses. 
Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly 
applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are reported as transfers. 
Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. All other interfund 
transfers are reported as operating transfers.  There were no operating transfers or residual equity transfers during fiscal 
year 2018. 

Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

2. Cash and Investments

The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible investments include direct obligations of the 
United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank and trust 
companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, and trust companies; 
Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit 
insurance.  As of the current fiscal year end, $1,194,043 was insured by FDIC or collateralized by the bank.  

Therefore, the District’s cash deposits and investments at June 30, 2018, were not exposed to Custodial Credit Risk, 
Investment Credit Risk, Investment Interest Rate Risk, or Concentration of Investment Credit Risk. The District does 
not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value 
losses arising from increasing interest rates. 

3. Interfund Receivables and Payables

There were no interfund receivables and payables at June 30, 2018. 

4. General Long-term Debt

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be received for any 
fiscal year without approval by the District's voters.  Bond issues have been approved by the voters and issued by the 
District for various capital improvements.  These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the 
date of issue.  General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable, obligations for compensated absences, 
early retirement incentive and capital leases.  Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance 
and future revenues of the debt service fund.

5. Other Post Employment Benefits

The District does not offer any early retirement incentive plans. 

6. Employee Retirement System

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System (the "System"), which is a 
cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement system (PERS). Under the system, contributions are made 
by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employees. 

Participation is required for all teachers and other certified employees and is optional for all other regular employees 
of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. A participant's date of membership is the date 
the first contribution is made to the System. The System is administered by a Board of Trustees which acts as a 
fiduciary for investing the funds and governing the administration of the System. The District has no responsibility or 
authority for the operation and administration of the System nor has it any liability, except for the current contribution 
requirements. 

A participant with five years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement allowance at the age of sixty-two or 
with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five. The normal retirement allowance paid monthly for life and then to 
beneficiaries, if certain options are exercised, equals two percent of the average of the highest three earning years on 
contributory service multiplied by the number of years of credited service. A participant leaving employment before 

15



 

attaining retirement age, but completing ten years of service, may elect to vest his accumulated contributions and defer 
receipt of a retirement annuity until a later date.  

When a participant dies in active service and has completed ten years of credited service, the beneficiary is entitled to a death 
benefit of $18,000.00 and the participant's contributions plus interest. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the 
surviving spouse may, in lieu of the death benefit, elect to receive, subject to the surviving spousal options, the 
participant's retirement benefits accrued at the time of death.   

The contribution rates for the District, which are not actuarially determined, and its employees are established by law. The 
District is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable compensation for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the 
participating members. The required contribution for participating members is 7%. 

The District’s contributions to the System for the year ending 

June 30, 2018      334,353 
June 30, 2017  311,870 
June 30, 2016      292,646

The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension benefits. This 
pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a 
result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no 
actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System issues a 
publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for the 
System.  

The system issues an independent financial report, financial statements, and required supplementary 
information that may be obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, 
OK 73152 or by calling 405-521-2387. 

7. Contingencies and Other Commitments

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies. Any 
disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, 
if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the District 
expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 

8. Risk Management

The District purchases commercial insurance policies covering property casualty loss, public liability, school board 
member and administrator liability, and workers compensation. The District also purchases surety bonds for 
employees in all positions required by state law to be bonded. Management believes such coverage is sufficient to 
preclude any significant uninsured losses to the District. 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; errors 
and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial insurance to cover these 
risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public official’s liability. Settled claims resulting 
from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or 
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASB No. 10, the School reports the 
required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 

16



 

Assurance group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' compensation coverage to 
participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control 
services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess 
insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the 
plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established 
payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the 
loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based on the school’s losses for the last five years. OSAG provides 
coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss 
fund. If the District does not use their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest. 

The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation Program. The funds 
for each District are kept separate. The money contributed by each District does not earn interest and is fully 
insured. If the District has claims in excess of the amount of their account, they would be liable for the excess. 

9. Accumulated Unpaid Vacation, Sick Leave Benefits, and Health Care Coverage

The District provides sick leave benefits to the certified staff in accordance with Title 70, Article 6-104, of the 
Oklahoma Statutes, which provides for an annual accrual of sick leave of ten days and personal business days accrual of 
three days. Ten days are allowed to accumulate up to a total of sixty days per employee. None of the benefits are 
payable upon retirement or death.  

10. Subsequent Events

Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of the auditor’s report, which is the date the financial 
statements were available to be issued.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT 
OF COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 

GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

To the Board of Education 
Colcord Public School, I-4 
Colcord, Oklahoma  

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory basis of 
Colcord School District No. I-4 (the School), Oklahoma as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the School’s financial 
statements, and have issued my report thereon dated December 6, 2018, which was adverse with respect to the 
presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not 
conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, my report was 
qualified for the omission of general fixed asset account groups with respect to the presentation of financial statements 
on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit, I considered the School’s internal control over financial reporting (internal 
control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing my 
opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
School's internal control. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements 
on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant deficiencies or material 
weaknesses. Given these limitations during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that I 
consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the school’s financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of my 
audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

24



Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the 
entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S 
REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM  

AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED 
BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

To the Board of Education 
Colcord Public School, I-4 
Colcord, Ok. 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the Colcord Public School, I-4, Delaware County, Oklahoma (the School) with the types of compliance 
requirements described in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance) that could have 
a direct and material effect on each of the School's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
School's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts and grants applicable 
to its federal programs.  

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the School’s major federal programs based on 
my audit. I conducted my audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued 
by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation 
(CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 
(The Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) 
Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The 
Uniform Guidance) require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the School’s 
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as I considered necessary in the 
circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance with each major federal program. 
However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the School’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, the School complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 
2018.  

26



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the School is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance 
with the types of compliance referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the 
School’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect 
on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal 
control over compliance in accordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, 
I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control over compliance.  

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance 
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or 
detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A 
material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal 
control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance.  

My consideration of the internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance 
that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.  

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal 
control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance). Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
