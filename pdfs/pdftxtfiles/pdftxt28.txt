INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Chandler School District 1-1 
Lincoln County, Oklahoma 

TELEPHONE 

(405) 258-2405 

I have audited the accompanying basic financial statements-regulatory basis of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Chandler 
School District I-1, Lincoln County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements 
in accordance with financial reporting provisions prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an 
acceptable basis for the preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances. 
Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I 
conducted my audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards 
require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amount and 
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 
judgment, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal 
control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

1 



I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for my audit opinion. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by the 
Chandler School District I-1, Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting 
provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which a basis of accounting other 
than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The effects on 
the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in 
Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although 
not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse 
Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraphs the financial statements 
referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of Chandler School 
District I-1, Lincoln County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and 
changes in financial position for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not include the general fixed asset 
account group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or 
permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded 
in the general fixed asset account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion 
on Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first 
paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balances arising 
from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of Chandler School 
District I-1, Lincoln County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and 
expenditures paid and encumbered for the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1. 

Other Matters 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements. The combining fund statements­
regulatory basis are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of 
the basic financial statements of the District. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of 
federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 US. Code of Federal 

2 



Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of 
the basic financial statements. 

The combining statements-regulatory basis and the other supplementary information including 
the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is the responsibility of management and was 
derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements-regulatory basis. Such information has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements-regulatory basis within the 
combined financial statements-regulatory basis and certain additionai procedures, including 
comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America. In my opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis and the 
other supplementary information including the schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are 
fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole arising 
from regulatory basis transactions. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards I have also issued my report dated March 
11, 2019, on my consideration of Chandler School District 1-1, Lincoln County, Oklahoma's, 
internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions 
of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that 
report is to describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control 
over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed 
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Chandler School District 1-1, 
Lincoln County, Oklahoma's, internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

CHANDLER SCHOOL DISTRICT 1-1 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 

YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The financial statements of the Chandler Public Schools Independent :Oistrict No. 1 (the 
"District") have been prepared in conformity with another comprehensive basis of accounting 
required by Oklahoma Statutes. The more significant of the District's accounting policies are 
described below. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The 
District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control 
of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support. The 
general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained 
in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The Chandler School Board of Education is the basic level of government which has financial 
accountability and control over all activities related to the public school education of the district. 
The Board receives funding from local, state, and federal government sources and must comply 
with the requirements of these funding source entities. However, the Board is not included in 
any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined by the GASB pronouncement, since Board 
members are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate 
management, the ability to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for 
fiscal matters. In addition, there are no potential component units as defined in Governmental 
Accounting Standard Board statement 14 which are included in the District's reporting entity. 

B. Fund Accounting and Description of Funds 

The accounts of the district are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered a 
separate accounting entity. The operation of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of 
self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund balance, revenue, and 
expenditures. 

Government Fund Types 

Government funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets ( capital projects funds), and the servicing of 
general long-term debt (debt service funds). The following funds are used by the district: 

7 



General Fund - The General Fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those 
required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local 
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures 
include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for programs funded 
for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds, and other 
long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be 
expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue fund is the District's Building Fund, and the Child 
Nutrition Fund. The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the 
purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and 
equipment. The Child Nutrition Fund consists of monies from federal, state, and local sources, 
restricted for meals served or food sold. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account 
for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal, 
interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied 
specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's Bond Fund and is used to 
account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, 
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovation existing facilities, and acquiring 
transportation equipment. 

Fiduciary Fund Types - Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside 
parties, including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. Agency 
funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their 
agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations. 

Agency Fund - The Agency Fund is the School Activities Fund which is used to account for 
monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored 
groups. The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, 
disbursing, and accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Group - Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts 
used only to establish accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for all 
long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund 
and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal. 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - The account group is used to account for property, plant, 
and equipment of the school district. The District does not have the information necessary to 
include this group in its combined financial statements. 

8 



Memorandum Only-Total Columns - The total columns presented in the combined financial 
statements are captioned Memorandum Only to indicate they are presented only to facilitate 
financial analysis. No consolidating entries or other eliminations were made in the aggregation 
of the totals; thus, they do not present consolidated information and do not purport to present 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form 
of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective dates of GASB 
Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements - Management's Discussion and Analysis -for 
State and Local Governments. This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education (OSDE) as follows: 

Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the 
expenditures of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased. 

Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 

Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 

Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 
obligation is incurred. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available 
and measureable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when 
the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned 
and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds. 

Revenues from local sources consist primarily of property taxes, and are recognized when 
received. Revenues received from the State Department of Education, U.S. Department of 
Education, and investment earnings are recognized when received. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

The District is required by state law to adopt annual budgets. Each budget is presented on the 
regulatory basis of accounting which is a prescribed basis of accounting other than generally 

9 



accepted accounting principles. There were no supplemental budgets. Original and final 
budgets were the same. 

The following procedures are followed in establishing the budgetary data reflected in the 
financial statements: 

A. Prior to July 1 of the preceding fiscal year, the District prepares a temporary estimate of 
needs (budget). This budget is prepared primarily to authorize the district to expend funds 
until the operating budget is prepared. 

B. The operating budget is prepared based on data received from the State Department of 
Education and county. 

C. The excise board of the county approves the budget after the tax conference, usually the first 
week in September. 

D. The board of education adopts the budget after publication in the newspaper and public 
notice of the meeting. 

E. The budget is then filed with the State Department of Education and county. 

Once a budget is approved, it can be amended only by approval of a majority of members of the 
board of education. Supplemental appropriations of original budget amounts are prepared prior 
to year end to authorize additional expenditures in excess of original budget amounts and must 
be published. All budget encumbered appropriates lapse at year end. Supplemental budgets for 
the Building Fund of $159,416.39 were approved. 

E. Assets. Liabilities, and Fund Equity 

Cash and Investments - Investments are all certificates of deposits recorded at cost. An 
employee of the school district acts as treasurer for the district, and upon approval of the board 
makes investments and pays warrants as so directed. 

Inventories - Accounting for inventories of materials, supplies, and food commodities are not 
maintained by the district. In accordance with OCAS standards, expenditures for inventory 
items are recorded as an expenditure when the warrant is issued. 

Property Tax Revenues - See Note 3. 

Compensated Absences - The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in accordance 
with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, Article 6-104 which provides an annual sick leave 
accrual of 10 days per year for certified employees. 

Other employees accrue one day sick leave per month. Accrued sick leave up to 120 days is 
accumulated in a "sick bank" which can be used to add up to one year's retirement to the 
Teachers Retirement System. This is an added benefit for retirement and the District has no 

10 



liability to the "sick bank". The amount of accumulated vested compensated absences and the 
amount payable from future resources at June 30, 2018, cannot be determined. Certified and 
non-certified personnel are allowed emergency and personal leave to accrue in the same manner 
sick leave is accrued. All sick leave, emergency, and personal leave are with pay. The District is 
on a regulatory basis of accounting and compensated absences are charged to the District when 
used. 

Teachers do not receive paid vacation, but are paid on the number of days they are required to 
work (180 days). Maintenance personnel receive two weeks of paid vacation per year if the 
employee is a 12 month employee. Administrative personnel receive vacation according to their 
contract. The District has no liability for unused vacation pay since all vacation leave is used or 
lost if not taken. Vacation pay is charged to operations when taken by the employees. 

In accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 43, 
Accounting for Compensated Absences, no liability is recorded for nonvesting accumulating 
rights to receives sick pay benefits. Vested accumulated rights are estimated with a portion 
budgeted for each school year; however, the District includes only expenditures paid with 
available financial resources in the combined financial statements. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due 
or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the 
following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from 
expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. 
The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term debt account 
group. Long-term liabilities expected to be financed from proprietary fund operations are 
accounted for in those funds. 

Fund Balance - Fund balance represents the cash and investments not encumbered by purchase 
order, legal contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

F. Revenue, Expenses, and Expenditures 

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by 
the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The 
State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on 
information accumulated from the districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of 
Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors 
disclosed by review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of 
revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be 
expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require the money not 
expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be 

11 



expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of Education requires that 
categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 

Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures 
or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses 
initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as 
expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are 
reported as transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as 
residual equity transfers. All other interfund transfers are reported as operating transfers. 

Statement of Cash Flows - The District is not required to present a statement of cash flows in 
fiscal 2018  combined financial statements. 

The purpose of the Statement of Cash flows is to provide relevant information about the cash 
receipts and payments during the year for proprietary and nonexpendable trust funds. 

2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS 

The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible investments include 
direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of 
savings and loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings 
certificates of savings and loan associations, and trust companies. Collateral is required for 
demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit 
insurance. In accordance with state statutes, the District's investment policy is: An employee of 
the school district is the treasurer for the District. The treasurer acts as agent for the District 
when investing funds. Upon approval of the board the treasurer makes investments as so 
directed. The depository bank deposits for safekeeping and trusts approved pledged securities in 
an amount to protect district funds on a day to day basis during the period of the contract. The 
treasurer maintains these funds. The pledge of approved securities is waived only to the extent 
of the dollar amount of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance. Deposits (cash and 
certificates) are carried at cost which approximates market value. The carrying amount of 
deposits is separately displayed on the balance sheet as "Cash" and "Investments". 

Deposits and Investments - The District's cash deposits and investments at June 30, 201 8, were 
completely insured or collateralized by federal deposit insurance, direct obligations of the United 
States Government, or securities held by the District or by its agent in the District's name. 

Therefore, the District's cash deposits and investments at June 30, 2018, were not exposed to 
Custodial Credit Risk, Investment Credit Risk, Investment Interest Rate Risk, or Concentration 
of Investment Credit Risk. 

12 



3. PROPERTY TAXES 

The District's ad valorem property tax is levied each July 1 on the assessed value listed as of the 
prior January 1 for all real and business personal property located in the District. The assessed 
value of the roll on January 1, 2017, upon which the levy for the 2017 fiscal year was based was 
$41,097,946 (net homestead expenses). 

The tax rates assessed for the year ended June 30, 2018, to finance General Fund operations, 
Building Fund operations, and the payment of principal and interest on general obligation long­
term debt were $.03629, $.00518, and $.01787 per $100 valuation, respectively, for a total of 
$.05934. 

Property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1 following the levy date. 
Taxes are due on December 31 and become delinquent by April 1 following the July 1 levy date. 
Current tax collection for the year ended June 30, 2018, were 97.1 % of the gross tax levied. The 
District does not account for property taxes receivables nor allowances for uncollectible taxes. 

4. EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT PLAN 

All of the District's eligible teaching employees and a portion of the District's support personnel 
participate in the Teacher's Retirement System ("TRS") of Oklahoma, a statewide multiple 
public employee retirement system covering employees of local school districts within the State 
of Oklahoma. TRS is a cost sharing public employee retirement system. TRS is funded through 
the State and school district and employee contributions with the District not having an 
obligation of paying benefits. As discussed below, the District has made contributions on behalf 
of employees. 

Membership is required of all teachers and other certified employees. Membership is optional of 
all other regular employees who work at least 20 hours per week. A member may retire at age 
62 upon completing at least 10 years of creditable Oklahoma service; or a member with at least 
10 years of creditable Oklahoma service may retire, with reduced benefits, as early as age 55. A 
member may also retire, with reduced benefits, at the age of which the sum of the member's age 
and the number of years of creditable service totals 80. As of 7/1/92, new participants must have 
their age and the number of years of creditable service total 90. 

The three primary sources of revenue for TRS are contributions from active members, dedicated 
revenue from the State of Oklahoma, and investment income. Participating members are 
required to contribute 7% of their applicable earnings. There is also an employer contribution of 
9.5% for fiscal year 2018. Chandler School District No. 1-1 has elected to pay their participating 
members non-taxed contributions. The District paid, as members' contributions, $210,895. 
Total contribution of $384,549 was made by the District. The District made retirement plan 
contributions on total covered salaries plus certain fringe benefits. The total covered salaries in 
the retirement plan are $4,047,872. Employee contribution to the System for the years ending 
June 30, 2016, 2017, and 2018, were $204,257, $197,528, and $210,895, respectively. 

13 



Ten year historical trend information is presented in the Teacher's Retirement System of 
Oklahoma Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2018. This information is useful in 
assessing the pension plan's accumulation of sufficient assets to pay pension benefits as they 
become due. 

The System issues an independent financial report, financial statements, and required 
supplementary information that can be obtained in writing at the Teacher's Retirement System of 
Oklahoma, Post Office Box 53524, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling 405-521-2387. 

5. HEALTH CARE COVERAGE 

The District has a life insurance plan with Met Life whereby the District offers to pay $36.00 
annually per employee for $15,000.00 life insurance. All employees who work at least a four 
hours per day work week have the option to be covered. The District offers a health insurance 
dental plan provided by the Oklahoma State and Educational Group Insurance Board. The 
District pays $594.90 for health insurance for classified employees electing to be covered and for 
non-classified employees electing to be covered. Employees electing not to be covered receive 
payment from the District as additional payroll. The State Department of Education reimburses 
the District at the above rates except that non-covered employees are reimbursed at the rate of 
$69.71 for classified and $189.69 for non-classified.

Group and current requirements for principal and interest expenditures are accounted for in the 
Debt Service Fund. There were a number of restrictions and limitations contained in the general 
obligation bond indentures. The District is in compliance with all significant limitations and 
restrictions at June 30, 2018. 

7. LEASES 

The school district sold their school buses in July, 1993, and leased these buses back as an 
operating transportation lease. There are eight route buses and two spare buses that are leased. 
Yearly lease is $130,000.00. This lease is renewable with cost increases to be no more than 
2.5% per fiscal year. 

The school district has leases for copiers at a cost of $2,777 per month depending on the usage. 

The District entered into a lease agreement on May 20, 2016, for land with payments due of 
$24,743 for two years and a final payment of $382, 1 69.72. 

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Grant Programs - Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and 
adjustment by grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, 
may constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which 
may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the District expects 
such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 

9. RISK MANAGEMENT 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to, and 
destruction of assets, errors and omissions, injuries to employees, employees' health and life, and 
natural disasters. The District manages these various risks of loss through the purchase of 
commercial insurance. Management believes such coverage is sufficient to preclude any 
significant uninsured losses to the District. Settled claims have not exceeded this insurance 
coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

15 



10. NON-MONETARY TRANSACTIONS 

The fair market value as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services of the 
commodities received during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, was $25,71 1 .99. 

1 1 . SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

Subse'luent events have been evaluated through March 1 1 , 2019, which is the date the financial

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Chandler School District I- 1 
Chandler, Oklahoma 74834 

TELEPHONE 

(405) 258-2405 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying basic 
financial statements-regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the 
aggregate remaining fund information of Chandler School District I-1 ,  Oklahoma, as of and for 
the year ended June 30, 201 8, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively 
comprise the District's financial statements, and have issued my report thereon dated March 1 1 , 
2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because the 
presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did 
not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. 
However, my report was qualified for the omission of generally fixed asset account groups with 
respect to the presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting 
authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit, I considered Chandler School District I-1 's  internal control 
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Chandler School District 
I- 1 's  internal control. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Chandler School District I- 1 's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to 
prevent or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected in a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 

27 
--------------- ----------------------- --- - - -·----



combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations during my audit, I did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control that I consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Chandler School District I-1 's financial 
statements are free of material misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which 
could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. 
However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of my 
audit and, accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government 
Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity's control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and 
compliance Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

CHANDLER, OKLAHOMA 7 4834 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 
PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE 

REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Chandler School District I- 1 
Lincoln County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Maior Federal Program 

TELEPHONE 

(405) 258-2405 

I have audited the Chandler School District No. I- l 's compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform 
Guidance) that could have a direct and material effect on each of Chandler School District No. I-1 's major 
federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Chandler School District I-l 's major federal 
programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of 
findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts and 
grants applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Chandler School District I-1 's major 
federal programs based on my audit. I conducted an audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and 
the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance). 
Those standard and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform 
Guidance) require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and 
material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence about Chandler School District I-1 's compliance with those requirements and performing such 
other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance with each major federal 
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of Chandler School District I-1 ' s  
compliance. 

29 



Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, Chandler School District I- 1 complied, in all material respects, with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018 .  

Report On Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the Chandler School District I-1 is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective 
internal control over compliance with the types of compliance referred to above. In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, I considered Chandler School District I- 1 ' s  internal control over 
compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major 
federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 
200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 
{The Uniform Guidance), but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal 
control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Chandler 
School District I-1 's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis . A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

My consideration of the internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance). Accordingly, this 
report is not suitable for any other purpose.
