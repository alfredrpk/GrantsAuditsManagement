INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

November 13,2018

The Honorable Board of Education 
Guthrie School District No. 1 
Logan County, Oklahoma

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements- 
regulatory basis of Guthrie School District No. 1, Logan County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year 
ended June 30, 2018, as listed in the table of contents.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education as described in Note 1, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the 
State Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable 
basis for the preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also 
responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit 
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating their overall 
presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our adverse and qualified audit opinions.



Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the financial reporting requirements of 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by the District, 
on the basis of the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America. The effects on the financial statements of the variances 
between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determined, are presumed to be 
material.

Adverse Opinion of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion 
on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to 
in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2018, or 
the revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the 
year then ended.

Basis for Unqualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting

The financial statements referred to above include supplemental information within the Notes to the 
Financial Statements regarding the District’s capital assets as of and for the year ending June 30, 
2018. The Oklahoma State Department of Education has determined that the omission of such 
capital asset information would be a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting that has been 
prescribed and/or permitted.

Unqualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in 
all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of the District, as of June 30, 2018, and the 
revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered, of each fund type, for the year then 
ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Matters

Other supplemental information

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and the account group 
financial statements -  regulatory basis within the combined financial statements. The combining 
fund statements -  regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under other 
supplementary information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required 
part of the combined financial statements -  regulatory basis of the District. The schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 
U.S Code o f Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic 
financial statements.

The combining statements -  regulatory basis, and the other supplementary information, including the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived 
from and relate directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial 
statements -  regulatory basis. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures 
applied in the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the combined 
financial statements — regulatory basis and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our 
opinion, the combining statements -  regulatory basis and the other supplementary information,



including the schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are fairly stated in all material respects in 
relation to the combined financial statements -  regulatory basis taken as a whole on the regulatory 
basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated November 
13, 2018 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting an on our 
tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and 
other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control 
over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion 
on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an 
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s 
internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



GUTHRIE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2018

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The basic financial statements of the Guthrie Public Schools Independent District No. 1, 
Logan County, Oklahoma (the “District”) have been prepared in conformity with an other 
comprehensive basis of accounting as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education. The more significant of the District’s accounting policies are described below.

A. Reporting Entity

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.

The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and 
control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on State of Oklahoma 
support. The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma 
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. 
The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

In evaluating how to define the district, for financial reporting purposes, management has 
considered all potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit 
in the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The basic, but not the only, criterion for including a 
potential component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body’s ability to 
exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this ability is 
financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight 
responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the 
designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations, and 
accountability for fiscal matters.

A second criterion used in evaluating potential component units is the scope of public 
service. Application of this criterion involves considering whether the activity benefits the 
District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted within the geographic 
boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons.

A third criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from 
the reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether 
the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities.

Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units included 
in the District’s reporting entity.

B. Fund Accounting and Description of Funds

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results 
of its operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid 
financial management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or 
activities.



GUTHRIE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2018

B. Fund Accounting and Description of Funds -  (continued')

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account 
group, on the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability 
for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly 
affect net expendable available financial resources.

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each 
category, in turn, is divided into separate “fund types.”

Governmental Fund Types

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government’s general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing 
of general long-term debt (debt service funds).

General Fund -  The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions, except 
those required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and 
local property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Salary Incentive Aid 
program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools 
except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and 
debt service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state 
restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs.

Special Revenue Fund -  The special revenue fund is the District’s Building Fund. The 
Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of 
erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment.

The Child Nutrition Fund derives monies from State, Federal and local sources.

The School Age Care Fund derives monies from State and local sources.

Debt Service Fund -  The debt service fund is the District’s Sinking Fund and is used to 
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term 
debt principal, interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property 
taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments.

Capital Projects Fund -  The capital projects fund is the District’s Bond Fund and is used to 
account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, 
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring 
transportation equipment.

Fiduciary Fund Types

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including 
other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are 
held under the terms of a trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and 
reporting. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds on 
behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations.



GUTHRIE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2018

Agency Fund -  The Agency fund is the School Activities fund, which is used to account for 
monies, collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District- 
sponsored groups. The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of 
collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.

Account Groups

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to 
establish accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets not accounted for in 
proprietary funds.

General Long-Term Debt Account Group -  This account group was established to account 
for all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt 
service fund and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt 
principal. It is also used to account for liabilities for compensated absences and early 
retirement incentives, which are to be paid from funds provided in future years.

General Fixed Asset Account Group -  This account group is used to account for property, 
plant, and equipment of the school district.

Memorandum Only -  Total Column - The total column on the general purpose financial 
statements is captioned “memorandum only” to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate 
financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial position, results of 
operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. Interfund eliminations have not been 
made in the aggregation of this data.

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted 
form of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB 
Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis-for 
State and Local Governments. This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 
34.

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education (OSDE) as follows:

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 
the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved.

• Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased.
• Capital assets in proprietary funds are recorded when acquired and depreciated over 

their useful lives.
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.
• Long-term debt is recorded when incurred.
• Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 

obligation is incurred.



GUTHRIE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2018

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation -  (continued!

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become 
available and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be 
recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when 
revenues are earned and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds.

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must 
be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the 
following July 1. If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold 
an election on the second Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If the preliminary budget 
does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. If an election is held and the 
taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. If voters reject 
the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate.

The District may upon approval by a majority of the electors of the District voting on the 
question make the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local support levy permanent. 
Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal budget is required for all funds except for trust 
and agency funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved 
budgeted appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for 
supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories.

E. Assets. Liabilities, and Fund Equity

Cash and Cash Equivalents -  For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the District 
considers all cash on hand, demand deposits, and highly liquid investments, with an original 
maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.

Investments -  Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States Government and 
Agencies with maturities greater than three months when purchased. All investments are 
recorded at cost, which approximates market value.

Property Tax Revenues -  The district is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which 
consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the district. The county 
assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the County Excise Board, 
extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer prior to 
October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt 
of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due 
prior to April 1.

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. 
Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. 
If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes 
due. The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. 
If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the 
property.

E. Assets. Liabilities, and Fund Equity -  (continued)

Inventories -  The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the 
basic financial statements.

Capital Assets -  The accounting treatment over capital assets (property, plant, and 
equipment) depends on whether the assets are used in governmental fund-type operations or 
proprietary fund-type operations. Fixed assets used in governmental fund-type operations 
(general fixed assets) are recorded for as capital outlay expenditures of the governmental 
fund-type upon acquisition and are recorded as property, plant, and equipment in the General 
Fixed Asset Account Group. Fixed assets used in proprietary fund-type operations are 
accounted for as property, plant, and equipment within the proprietary fund itself.

All fixed assets are valued at historical cost, or estimated cost if actual is unavailable, except 
for donated fixed assets, which are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of 
donation.

Depreciation and accumulated depreciation are not reported against general fixed assets.

Compensated Absences -  The district provides vacation and sick leave benefits in 
accordance with Oklahoma Statutes, which provides for annual sick leave and personal 
business days. Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected in the financial 
statements because such statements are prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. This 
practice differs from generally accepted accounting principles.

Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated with expendable 
available financial resources is reported as an expenditure and a fund liability of the 
governmental fund that will pay it. There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation 
leave that are not expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources.

Long-Term Debt -  Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when 
due or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in 
the following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be 
financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a 
governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general 
long-term debt account group. Long-term liabilities expected to be financed from proprietary 
fund operations are accounted for in those funds.

Fund Balance -  Fund balance represents the cash and investments not encumbered by 
purchase order, legal contracts, and outstanding warrants.

F. Revenue. Expenses, and Expenditures

State Revenues -  Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed 
by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts 
based on information accumulated from the districts.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,2018

F. Revenue. Expenses, and Expenditures -  (continued!

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department 
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors 
disclosed by review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of 
revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs 
be expended only for the program for which the money is provided. These rules also require 
that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the 
following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of 
Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund.

Interfund Transactions -  Quasi-extemal transactions are accounted for as revenues, 
expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or 
expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund are 
recorded as expenditure/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. All other interfund 
transactions, except quasi-extemal transactions and reimbursements, are reported as transfers.

G. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting -  Estimate of Needs

The District is required by state law and prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget 
must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning 
the following July 1. If the preliminary budget requires additional levy, the District must 
hold an election on the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If the preliminary 
budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. If an election is held 
and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. If voters 
reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate. A 
budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue 
Funds (Building Fund, School Age Care Fund, and Child Nutrition Fund) and the Debt 
Service Fund, that includes revenues and expenditures.

The 2017-18 Estimate of Needs was approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the 
County Clerk. The Estimate of Needs was approved by the excise board and the requested 
levies were made.

H. Encumbrances

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or 
services. Encumbrance accounting—under which purchase orders and other commitments of 
resources are recorded as expenditures of the applicable fund—is utilized in all governmental 
funds of the District. Appropriations not used or encumbered will lapse at the end of the 
year.

I. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting 
period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

DEPOSIT AND INVESTMENT RISKS

Custodial Credit Risk - The District’s policy as it relates to custodial credit risk is to secure 
its uninsured deposits with collateral, valued at no more than market value, at least at a level 
of 100 percent of the uninsured deposits and accrued interest thereon. The investment policy 
and state law also limits acceptable collateral to U.S. Treasury and agency securities and 
direct debt obligations of the state, municipalities, counties, and school districts in the 
state of Oklahoma, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As required by Federal 12 U.S.C.A., 
Section 1823(e), all financial institutions pledging collateral to the District must have a 
written collateral agreement approved by the board of directors or loan committee.

At June 30,2018, the District was not exposed to custodial credit risk as defined above.

Investment Credit Risk -  The District’s investment policy limits investments to those 
allowed in state law applicable to school districts as follows:

a. Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities to which the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. Government is pledged, or obligations to the payment of 
which the full faith and credit of the State is pledged.

b. Certificates of deposit or savings accounts that are either insured or secured with 
acceptable collateral with in-state financial institutions, and fully insured certificates of 
deposit or savings accounts in out-of-state financial institutions.

Investment Credit Risk (continued) - Investment credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other 
counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The District has no formal 
policy limiting investments based on credit rating, but discloses any such credit risk 
associated with their investments. Unless there is information to the contrary, obligations of 
the U.S. government or obligations explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government are not 
considered to have credit risk and do not require disclosure of credit quality.

Investment Interest Rate Risk -  Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will 
adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The District’s investment policy limits 
investments to those with a short-term maturities, as a means of managing exposure to fair 
value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The District discloses it exposure to 
interest rate risk by disclosing the maturity dates of its various investments.

Concentration of Investment Credit Risk -  Exposure to concentration of credit risk is 
considered to exist when investments in any one issuer represent a significant percent of total 
investments of the District (any over 5 percent are disclosed). Investments issued or 
explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and investments in mutual funds, external 
investment pools, and other pooled investments are excluded from this consideration. The 
District’s investment policy requires diversification of investments.

At June 30, 2018, the District had no concentration of credit risk as defined above.

GENERAL LONG-TERM DEBT

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the 
revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the District’s voters. Bond 
issues have been approved by the voters and issued by the District for various capital 
improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the 
date of issue.

General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable, obligations for compensated 
absences, and capital leases. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from 
fund balance and future revenues of the debt service fund.

6. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM

Basis of Accounting

The System’s financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America. The financial statements have also 
been prepared in compliance with the requirements of the Government Accounting 
Standards Board Statement No. 34.

The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, under which 
expenses are recorded when the liability is incurred, revenues are recorded in the accounting 
period they are earned and become measurable, and investment purchases and sales are 
recorded as of their trade dates. Member and employer contributions are recognized when 
due, pursuant to formal commitments. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and 
payable.

The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of 
pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated 
pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed 
to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. Actuarial valuations are 
not performed on individual school districts. The nonfunded pension benefit obligation of 
the System, as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation indicates a significant 
unfunded pension benefit obligation.

Funding Policy

A participant with five years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement 
allowance at the age of sixty-two (62) or with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five (55). 
The normal retirement allowance paid monthly for life and then to beneficiaries, if certain 
options are exercised, equals two percent of the average of the highest three earning years of 
contributory service multiplied by the number of years of credited service. A participant 
leaving employment before attaining retirement age, but completing ten years of service, may 
elect to vest his/her accumulated contributions and defer receipt of a retirement annuity until 
a later date. When a participant dies in active service and has completed ten years of credited 
service, the beneficiary is entitled to a death benefit of $18,000.00 and the participant’s 
contributions plus interest. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse 
may, in lieu of the death benefit elect to receive, subject to the surviving spousal options, the 
participant’s retirement benefits accrued at the time of death. The contribution rates for the 
Districts, which are not actuarially determined, and its employees are established by statute 
and applied to the employee’s earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits. Employers’ 
contribution of applicable earnings was 9.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM (CONTINUED)

Annual Pension Cost

The District’s total payroll and related contributions to the System were as follows:

CONTINGENCIES

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by 
grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may 
constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may 
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the District expects 
such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.

RISK MANAGEMENT AND LITIGATION

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to, and 
destruction of assets, errors and omissions, injuries to employees, employees’ health and life, 
and natural disasters. The District manages these various risks of loss through the purchase 
of commercial insurance. Management believes such coverage is sufficient to preclude any 
significant uninsured losses to the District. Settled claims have not exceeded this insurance 
coverage in any of the past three fiscal years.

Subsequent events have been evaluated through November 13, 2018, which is the date the 
financial statements were issued.

Note A: Basis of Presentation - The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards includes the federal grant activity of the 
Guthrie Public Schools District and is presented on another comprehensive basis of accounting conforming 
with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education which is 
a comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles. Under this method, 
expenditures are recognized when an approved purchase order is issued.

Note B: Commodities representing non-cash expenditures have been included in the Schedule of Federal Awards which 
is an exception to the prescribed basis of accounting.

Note C: Federal expenditures reported above were chargeable to the respective Federal programs, however, in some 
instances, they may not be identical to amounts recorded under the specific OCAS project codes in the District’s 
accounting records. Common reasons for those variances include: (1) timing differences, (2) differences in basis 
of accounting utilized, (3) mis-coding to other project codes, (4) refunds or reimbursements that offset expenditure 
data, (5) matching (or other local) expenditures that supplement or exceed Federal awarded amounts, and (6) approved 
indirect costs which are recorded under separate project codes.

Note D: The District did not receive any Federal awards that were passed through to subrecipients.

Note E: The District did not elect to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate allowed by the Uniform Guidance.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements 

Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards

November 13, 2018

The Honorable Board of Education 
Guthrie School District No. 1 
Logan County, Oklahoma

We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and 
account group financial statements-regulatory basis of Guthrie School District No. 1, Logan County, 
Oklahoma as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial 
statements, and have issued our report thereon dated November 13, 2018, which was adverse with 
respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of 
accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of 
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, our report was qualified for the omission 
of general fixed asset account groups with respect to the presentation of financial statements on the 
regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit, we considered the District’s internal control over financial 
reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent 
or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to 
merit attention by those charged with governance.



Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free 
of material misstatement; we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 
material effect on the determination of financial statements amounts. However, providing an opinion 
on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not 
express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other 
matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

Purpose of this Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and 
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Independent Auditor’s Report on Compliance for Each Major Program 
and on Internal Controls over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance

November 13, 2018

The Honorable Board of Education 
Guthrie School District No. 1 
Logan County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

We have audited Guthrie School District No. 1, Logan County, Oklahoma (the District's) 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance 
Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District’s major federal 
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District’s major federal programs are identified in 
the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned 
costs.

Management’s Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal 
programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We 
conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 
United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). 
Those standards and Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District’s compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s 
compliance.



Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In our opinion, the District, complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major 
federal programs for the year ended June 30,2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of the District, is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control 
over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, we considered the District’s internal control over compliance 
with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal 
program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and 
report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over 
compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of the internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in 
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements 
of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

November 13, 2018

The Honorable Board of Education 
Guthrie School District No. 1 
Logan County, Oklahoma

We have audited financial statements of Guthrie School District No. 1, Logan County, Oklahoma, as 
of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, as listed in the table of contents, and have issued our report 
thereon dated November 13, 2018. As a part of our audit, we made a study and evaluation of the 
District's system of internal accounting control to the extent we considered necessary solely to 
determine the nature, timing and extent of our auditing procedures. Our study and evaluation was 
more limited than would be necessary to express an opinion on the system of internal accounting 
control taken as a whole, and we do not express such an opinion.

However, during our audit we became aware of some matters that, while not involving material 
weaknesses in internal accounting control, are opportunities for strengthening internal controls and 
operating efficiency. The memorandum that accompanies this letter summarizes our comments and 
suggestions regarding those matters. This letter does not affect our report dated, November 13, 2018 
on the financial statements of Guthrie School District No. 1.

We will review the status of these comments during our next audit engagement. We would be 
pleased to discuss these comments in further detail at your convenience, to perform any additional 
study of these matters or to assist you in implementing the recommendations.

We also wish to express our appreciation of the courteous attention and cooperation which we 
received from staff members during our engagement.

Sincerely,

Jerry W. Putnam, CPA
