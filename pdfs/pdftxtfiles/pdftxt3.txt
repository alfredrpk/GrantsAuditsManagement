Independent Auditor’s Report  
 
 
 

Board of Directors 
The Oklahoma Mental Health Council 
   d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of The Oklahoma Mental Health Council d/b/a 
Red Rock Behavioral Health Services (Red Rock), which comprise the balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 
and 2017, and the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and cash flows for the years 
then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We 
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  
In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.   

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.

Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Nature of Operations 

The Oklahoma Mental Health Council d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services (Red Rock) is a 
not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to provide mental and behavioral health services to 
individuals of all ages and severity of illness.  Red Rock primarily earns revenue from providing 
outpatient mental and behavioral health services at various locations throughout the state of 
Oklahoma. 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Red Rock considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be 
cash equivalents.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, cash equivalents consisted of a money market 
mutual fund.   

At June 30, 2018, Red Rock’s cash accounts exceeded federally insured limits by approximately 
$4,243,000. 

At June 30, 2018 and 2017, Red Rock’s sweep account balance of approximately $754,000 and 
$1,051,000, respectively, was not covered by FDIC insurance.  The sweep account is invested in 
the Cavanal Hill U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund.   

Investments 

At June 30, 2018 and 2017, short-term investments consisted of certificates of deposit.  The 
investments in equity investees are reported on the equity method of accounting (cost plus equity in 
the investee’s undistributed net income since acquisition). 

Accounts Receivable 

Red Rock reports patient accounts receivable for services rendered at net realizable amounts from 
third-party payers, patients and others.  Red Rock provides an allowance for doubtful accounts 
based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information and existing 
economic conditions.  As a service to the patient, Red Rock bills third-party payers directly and 
bills the patient when the patient’s liability is determined.  Accounts are considered delinquent and

subsequently written off as uncollectible accounts based on individual credit evaluation and 
specific circumstances of the account. 

Contract revenue and related receivables are recognized in the period in which the related contract 
services are performed.  Accounts are written off as contractual adjustments when Red Rock 
exceeds the contractual amount in a given year. 

Net Patient Service Revenue 

Red Rock has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments to Red Rock at 
amounts different from its established rates.  Net patient service revenue is reported at the 
estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payers and others for services rendered 
and includes estimated retroactive revenue adjustments.  Retroactive adjustments are considered in 
the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered, and 
such estimated amounts are revised in future periods as adjustments become known.   

Red Rock has contracts with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse 
Services, Oklahoma Health Care Authority, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide specified services to certain mentally ill and 
other patients.  Contract revenue and related receivables are recognized in the period in which the 
related contract services are performed. 

Property and Equipment 

Red Rock capitalizes all property and equipment with lives greater than one year and a cost of 
$5,000 or greater.  Property and equipment acquisitions are recorded at cost and are depreciated 
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset.  Assets under capital 
lease obligations and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or 
their respective estimated useful lives. 

The estimated useful lives for each major depreciable classification of property and equipment are 
as follows: 

Land improvements 3–30 years 
Buildings and improvements 7–30 years 
Leasehold improvements 7–30 years 
Equipment 3–15 years 

 
Long-Lived Asset Impairment 

Red Rock evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or 
circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If a long-lived asset is tested 
for recoverability and the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use 
and eventual disposition of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset cost is 
adjusted to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying

Notes to Financial Statements

amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.  No asset impairment was recognized during the 
years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

Charity Care 

Red Rock provides care without charge or at amounts less than its established rates to patients 
meeting certain criteria under its charity care policy.  Because Red Rock does not pursue collection 
of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are not reported as net patient service 
revenue. 

Professional Liability Coverage and Claims 

Red Rock recognizes an accrual for claim liabilities based on estimated ultimate losses and costs 
associated with settling claims and a receivable to reflect the estimated insurance recoveries, if any.  
Professional liability claims are described more fully in Note 9. 

Income Taxes 

Red Rock has been recognized as exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the 
Internal Revenue Code and a similar provision of state law.  However, Red Rock is subject to 
federal income tax on any unrelated business taxable income. 

Red Rock files tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction.   

Self-Insurance 

Red Rock has elected to self-insure certain costs related to employee health.  Costs resulting from 
noninsured losses are charged to income when incurred.  Red Rock has purchased insurance that 
limits its exposure for individual claims to $85,000 per policy year and that limits its aggregate 
exposure per policy year.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, Red Rock had accrued a liability for 
approximately $191,000 and $287,000, respectively. 

Transfers Between Fair Value Hierarchy Levels  

Transfers in and out of Level 1 (quoted market prices), Level 2 (other significant observable 
inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) are recognized on the period beginning date.

Note 2: Net Patient Service Revenue 

Red Rock has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments to Red Rock at 
amounts different from its established rates.  These payment arrangements include: 

 Medicare – Substantially all outpatient services are paid based on predetermined rates based 
on services provided to patients. 

 Medicaid and Government-Sponsored Contracts – Outpatient services rendered to the 
Medicaid program and government-sponsored contract beneficiaries are reimbursed on a 
prospectively determined fee schedule. 

Approximately 94% and 93% of net patient service revenue is from participation in Medicare, 
Medicaid and government-sponsored contracts for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively.  Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are complex 
and subject to interpretation and change.  As a result, it is reasonably possible that recorded 
estimates will change materially in the near term. 

Red Rock has also entered into payment agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers, 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.  The basis for payment to 
Red Rock under these agreements includes prospectively determined rates and discounts from 
established charges. 

Note 3: Concentration of Credit Risk 

Red Rock grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are residents within an area 
where Red Rock has a location.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the mix of net patient accounts and 
government contracts receivable was: 

2018 2017

Medicare, Medicaid and government-sponsored contracts 99% 99%
Patients and other third-party payers 1% 1%

100% 100%

 

Note 4: Investments and Investment Return 

Short-term investments consisted of certificates of deposit of $17,000,000 and $15,000,000 at 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Investment return is reflected in other income in the accompanying statements of operations and 
changes in net assets.  Investment return of $240,038 and $83,773 for the years ended June 30, 
2018 and 2017, respectively, is comprised primarily of interest income.

Red Rock has contracted with an architectural firm, approved by the Board of Directors, to provide 
architectural and engineering services related to construction, design and remodeling projects.  A 
partner of the architectural firm is a member of Red Rock’s Board of Directors.  Red Rock incurred 
expenses from the architectural firm for architectural and subcontracted engineering services of 
approximately $191,000 and $19,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   

Note 8: Retirement Plans 

Red Rock has a defined contribution pension plan.  The plan covers substantially all full-time 
employees who have completed 18 months of service and allows part-time employees with 18 
months of service who work more than 1,000 hours per calendar year to be eligible to participate in 
the plan.  Red Rock contributes 5% of each participant’s annual salary to the plan.  Red Rock also 
has a 457 deferred compensation plan for members of management.  Retirement plan expense for 
both plans was approximately $728,000 and $657,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively. 

Note 9: Significant Estimates and Concentrations  

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require disclosure of 
certain significant estimates and current vulnerabilities due to certain concentrations.  Those 
matters include the following: 

Allowance for Net Patient Service Revenue Adjustments 

Estimates of allowances for adjustments included in net patient service revenue are described in 
Notes 1 and 2. 

Professional Liability Claims 

Red Rock purchases medical malpractice insurance under a claims-made policy on a fixed 
premium basis.  Under such a policy, only claims made and reported to the insurer during the 
policy term, regardless of when the incidents giving rise to the claims occurred, are covered.   

Based upon Red Rock’s claims experience, an accrual had been made for Red Rock’s estimated 
medical malpractice costs, including costs associated with litigating or settling claims, under its 
malpractice insurance policy, amounting to approximately $237,000 and $265,000 as of June 30, 
2018 and 2017, respectively.  Professional liability reserve estimates represent the estimated 
ultimate cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through the respective balance sheet 
dates.  It is reasonably possible that this estimate could change materially in the near term.

Red Rock’s professional liability risks are insured through unrelated commercial insurance carriers.  
The amounts receivable under these insurance contracts of approximately $237,000 and $265,000 
are included in prepaid and other assets at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Government Contracts 

Red Rock receives a significant portion of its revenue each year through annual contracts with 
various governmental agencies (see Notes 1 and 2).  Should the annual contracts be terminated or 
not renewed by the various governmental agencies, the operations of Red Rock could be adversely 
impacted. 

These contracts are generally subject to audits by the respective grantor agency and those audits 
may result in disallowed costs and/or other noncompliance findings, which could result in 
repayment of amounts by Red Rock.  As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, management has accrued 
$1,086,000 and $600,000, respectively, based on past audit results related to this potential liability.  
It is reasonably possible that the recorded estimate will change materially in the near term. 

Patient Assistance Programs 

Patient Assistance Programs (PAP) are programs offered by most pharmaceutical companies to 
provide medication to individuals who meet certain eligibility requirements, generally, those 
individuals who would not otherwise be able to afford purchasing medication on their own.  As a 
service to its patients, Red Rock assists individuals in enrolling in certain PAPs.  Because Red 
Rock does not have the power to direct the usage of the donated medication nor does it actually 
receive the donated medication, these amounts are not reported as in-kind contribution revenue.  
During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the total value of the medication that individuals 
received through PAPs was approximately $8,564,000 and $5,750,000, respectively.  

Litigation 

In the normal course of business, Red Rock is, from time to time, subject to allegations that may or 
do result in litigation.  Some of these allegations are in areas not covered by commercial insurance, 
for example, allegations regarding performance of contracts.  Red Rock evaluates such allegations 
by conducting investigations to determine the validity of each potential claim.  Based upon the 
advice of counsel, management records an estimate of the amount of ultimate expected loss, if any, 
for each of these matters.  It is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate 
resolution of such claims and lawsuits, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the 
financial position, changes in net assets and cash flows of Red Rock.  Events could occur that 
would cause the estimate of ultimate loss to differ materially in the near term. 

Self-Insurance 

Self-insurance related to employee health is described in Note 1.

Note 10: Line of Credit 

During 2016 and through June 2017, Red Rock had a $500,000 line of credit loan agreement with a 
bank, which is secured by real estate.  The loan agreement was scheduled to mature on June 30, 
2018, with any outstanding amounts bearing interest at 5%.  In June 2017, Red Rock renewed this 
promissory note for $1,000,000 with a maturity date of June 26, 2019, with any outstanding 
amounts bearing interest at prime rate, but limited to no more than 8% and no less than 5%.  At 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, no amounts were borrowed or outstanding related to the line of credit loan 
agreement.   

Note 11: Disclosures About Fair Value of Assets 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between 
market participants at the measurement date.  Fair value measurements must maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There is a hierarchy of three levels 
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets, 
quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can 
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the 
assets 

Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the 
fair value of the assets 

Recurring Measurements 

The fair value measurements of assets recognized in the accompanying balance sheets measured at 
fair value on a recurring basis consisted of a money market mutual fund of $753,912 and 
$1,050,962 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.   

Money Market Mutual Fund 

Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, assets are classified within Level 1 
of the valuation hierarchy.  At June 30, 2018 and 2017, Level 1 investments consisted of a money 
market mutual fund, which was valued at cost, which approximates fair value.  There were no 
Level 2 or Level 3 investments. 

Note 12: Subsequent Events 

Subsequent events have been evaluated through December 21, 2018, which is the date the financial 
statements were available to be issued.

1. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (the Schedule) includes the 
federal awards activity of The Oklahoma Mental Health Council d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral 
Health Services (Red Rock) under programs of the federal government for the year ended 
June 30, 2018.  The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform 
Guidance).  Because the Schedule presents only a selected portion of the operations of Red 
Rock, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, changes in net assets or 
cash flows of Red Rock. 

2. Expenditures reported on the Schedule are reported on the accrual basis of accounting.  Such 
expenditures are recognized following, as applicable, either the cost principles in U.S. Office 
of Management and Budget Circular A-122, Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations, or 
the cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance, wherein certain types of expenditures 
are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement.  Red Rock has elected not to use the 10 
percent de minimis indirect costs rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance.

Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on 
Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of 
Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with 

Government Auditing Standards 
 

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
 

Board of Directors 
The Oklahoma Mental Health Council 
   d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of The Oklahoma Mental 
Health Council d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services (Red Rock), which comprise the balance 
sheet as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of operations and changes in net assets and cash 
flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report 
thereon dated December 21, 2018. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Red Rock’s internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Red Rock’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Red Rock’s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or 
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement 
of Red Rock’s financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less 
severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Red Rock’s financial statements are free of 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The 
results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be 
reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

We noted certain matters that we reported to Red Rock’s management in a separate letter dated  
December 21, 2018. 

Purpose of This Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering Red Rock’s internal control and compliance.  
Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
 

Board of Directors

   d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited The Oklahoma Mental Health Council d/b/a Red Rock Behavioral Health Services’ (Red 
Rock) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance 
Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of Red Rock’s major federal programs for 
the year ended June 30, 2018.  Red Rock’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of 
auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, contracts and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Red Rock’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Red Rock’s compliance 
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.   

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Red Rock’s compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, Red Rock complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018.   

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 

Management of Red Rock is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered Red Rock’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of Red Rock’s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 
Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. 

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform 
Guidance 

We have audited the financial statements of Red Rock as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
have issued our report thereon dated December 21, 2018, which contained an unmodified opinion on 
those financial statements.  Our audit was performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the 
financial statements as a whole.  The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is 
presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required

part of the financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived 
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial 
statements.  The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial 
statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our opinion, the schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements 
as a whole.
