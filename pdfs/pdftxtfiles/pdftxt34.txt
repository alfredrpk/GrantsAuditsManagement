Report on the.Financial Statements 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT · . 

I have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the 

. aggregate remaining fund information of the Muskogee School District 1-20, Muskogee County, Oklahoma, as of 
and for the year ended June 30, 2018, which collectively comprise the basic finc~ncial statements as listed in the 
table of contents. · · · 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsjble for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 

implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. · 

· Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit 

in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of 
the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 

financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the 

financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I. express no 
· such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 

reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. · 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit 
·opinion. 

Opinion 

· In my opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 

financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate 

remaining fund information of the Muskogee School District as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in its 
financial· position and,. where applicable, cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with accounting 

principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 



Other Matters · 

Required Supplementary Information · 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's 

discussion and analysis and the required supplementary information, as listed in the table of contents, be 

presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not.a part of the basic 

financial statements, is required by the Governmental Auditing Standards Board who considers it to be an essential 

part of the financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or 

historical context. I have applied certain limited procedures to the required· supplementary information in 

accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United. States of America, which consisted of 

inquiries of management about the methods· of .preparing the information and comparing the information for 

consistency with management's responses to my inquiries, the· basic financial statements, and. other knowledge I · 

obtained during my audit of the basic financial statements. I do not express an opinion or provide any assurance ·. 

on the information because the limited procedures do not provide me with sufficient evidence to express an opinion .. 
· or provide any assurance. · · · · · 

Other Supplementary Information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements t.hat colle¢tiyely comprise . 

the basis financial statements. The. Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of· . 

additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code. of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative ·· · 

Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, .and is. also not a required part of the · · 

basic financial statements. · · 

·The Sch~dule of Expe~ditures of F~deral Awards is the ~esponsibility of m~nagement and was derived from and. 
relates directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the basic financial statements .. ·Si.Joh · • · 

information· has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in· the audit of the basic financial and other . 

additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting ·. 

and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements, and other additional procedures in accordance 

with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In my opinion, the supplementary 

information including the Schedule of Expenditure·s of Federal Awards is fairly stated in all material respects in 

relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. · 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated January 22, 2019, on my 

considerati.on of Muskogee School District No. 1-20, Muskogee County, Oklahoma's, internal control over financial 

reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant 

agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of my testing of internal control 

over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal 

control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in 

accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in assessing the results of my audit.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 



Muskogee School District 1-020 
Management Discussion and Analysis 

June 30, 2018 

The discussion and analysis of Muskogee Public Schools (the District) financial performa
nce 

provides an overall review of the District financial activities for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 

2018. The intent of this discussion is to convey relevant facts and commentary regarding 
the 

financial performance of the organization for the reporting period. A thorough examination of
 the 

financial statements and thoughtful reading of the related notes to those statements wilt aid
 in 

evaluating the financial position of the District. 

The financial highlights of Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018 and a comparative analysis of finan
cial 

information from those years is presented to aid the reader and in a more meanin
gful 

understanding of the District's financial performance for Fiscal Year 2018. 

Financial Highlights 

Fiscal Year 2018 operations generated significant budget activity for the General Fund. 

Current information is presented alongside that of Fiscal Year 2017 to illustrate changes 

in General Fund balance. Both years are presented on the accrual basis of accounting . 

for district-wide statements and modified accrual basis of accounting for the fund financial 

statements.

On a district-wide basis the district's liabilities exceeded its assets by $ 9,750,332 as of 

June 30, 2018. This was an increase of $17,289,289 over the June 30, 2017 ending net 

assets. 

The District's bond fund has made a huge impact in numerous areas. Much needed 

renovations and repairs on old buildings, building new buildings, new buses, replacement 

of old technology and addition of technology where lacking. 

Enrollment decreased by 80 in FY 2018 versus FY 2017. This downward trend looks to 

continue for FY 2019, live births are decreasing in the county as a whole, and thus; the · 

District's enrollment. 

Overview of the Financial Statements 

This annual report consists of four parts: management's discussion and analysis (this sectio
n), 

the basic financial statements, the required supplementary information, and a statistical sect
ion .. 

The basic financial statements include two kinds of statements that present views of the distric
t: 

• The first two statements are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term 

and long-term information about the district's overall financial status. 

• The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual 

parts of the district, reporting the district's operations in more detail than the district-wide 

statements.

Management Discussion and Analysis 

June 30, 2018 

Overview of the Financial Statements (continued) 

• The governmental funds statements tell how basic services such as regular and special 

education were financed in the short term as well what remains for future spending. 

• Fiduciary funds statements provide information abut the financial relationships in which 

the district acts sole as a trustee or agent for the benefit of others. 

The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements 

and provide more detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required 

supplementary information that further explains and supports the financial statements with a 

comparison of the district's budget for the year. The statistical section is a compilation of data for 

a ten-year period in summary form for informational purposes only. 

District-wide Statements 

The district-wide statements report information about the district as a whole using accounting 

methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement of net assets includes 

all of the District's assets and liabilities. All of the current year's revenues and expenses are 

accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid. 

The two district-wide statements report the district's net assets and how they have changed .. Net 

assets - the difference between the district's assets and liabilities - are one way to measure the 

district's financial health or position. · 

• Over time, increases or decreases in the District's net assets are an indicator of whether 

its financial position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 

• To assess the district's overall health, you need to consider additional non-financial 

factors such as changes in the District's property tax base (which is averaging a 4% per 

year increase with little loss in home values) and the conditions of schools buildings and. 

other facilities. 

In the district-wide financial statements, most of the district's basic services are included here, 

such as regular and special education, transportation, and administration. Property taxes and 

state aid finance most of these activities, but MPS does receive more federal funding than most 

school districts due to the large number of impoverished students it has. 

Fund Financial Statements 

The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the district's funds, 

focusing on its significant or "major" funds - not the· district as a whole. Funds are accounting 

devises the district uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular 

programs. 

• Some funds are required by state law and by bond covenants. . 

• The district establishes other funds to control arid manage money for particular purposes 

(such as repaying its long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues·. 

(such as federal grants). ·.

Fund Financial Statements (continued) 

The district has two kinds of funds: 

Muskogee Schooi District 1-020 
Management Discussion and Analysis 

June 30, 2018 

• Governmental funds: Most of the district's basic services are included in governmental 
funds, which generally focus on (1) how cash and other financial assets that can readily 
be converted to cash flow in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are 
available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide a 
detailed short-term view that helps you determine whether there are more or fewer 
financial resources that can be spent in the. near future to finance the district's programs. 
Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the 
governmental funds statements, it explains the relationship (or differences) between 
them. 

• Fiduciary funds: The district is the trustee, or fiduciary, for assets that belong to other$, 
such as the scholarship fund and the students' activities fund and the sanctioned parent 
·and/or booster club funds. The district is responsible. for ensuring that the assets 
reported in these funds are used only for their intended purposes and by those to whom 
the assets belong. The district excludes these activities from the district-wide financial 
statements because it cannot use these assets to finance its operations. 

Financial Analysis of the District as a Whole 

Net Position: Net assets serve over time as a useful indicator of a government's financial 
position. The change in net position is important because it identifies whether the financial 
position of the District has improved or diminished. The District's combined net position was 
higher on June 30, 2018, than it was the year before, increasing to $(9, 750,332). This was an 
increase of $17,289,289 over the close of the FY 2017 net position. 

Changes in net position: Net changes may be the result of many factors, including, but not limited 
to, state and federal funding, changes in the property tax base, investment rates of return, bond 
activity and current legislation affecting school funding or education mandates. 

In the Statement of Net Assets and the Statement of Activities, all district activities are considered 
to be of the governmental type. This includes instruction, supports services, operation and 
maintenance of plane, pupil transportation, and extracurricular activities. 

Significant fluctuations occurred in specific government activity categories. Operating grants and 
contributions increased due to receiving more federal funds than the District received in the 
previous year. All other sources of revenue were up slightly. Instructions services was almost 
flat, while transportation and debt services were up significantly.

Governmental Activities 

Muskogee School District 1-020 
Management Discussion and Analysis 

June 30, 2018 

As noted earlier, the District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with 
budgetary and finance-related legal requirements. 

Governmental funds. The general fund is the chief operating fund of the District. At June 30, 
2018, the general fund balance was $3,354,909 with $82,352 nonspendable, leaving ·an 
unassigned fund balance of $3,272,557. 

As shown in the "Statement of Net Position" on page 8 of the financial statements the increase in 
net position is a result of $9, 703,582 reduction in long term debt; $2,692,230 increase in District 
Net Fixed Assets; $836,934 increase in governmental fund total fund balances; $2,926 reduction 
in deferred revenues and a $4,059,469 reduction of Deferred Outflows and Inflows related to 
pensions. Deferred outflows of resources are consumptions of net assets that are applicable to a 
future period. It includes pensions resulting from school district contributions, subsequent to the 
measurement date and will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year 
ended June 30, 2018. Deferred inflows of resources related to pensions are amounts which will 
be recognized as pension expense in subsequent fiscal years. 

Capital Asset and Debt Administration 

Capital Assets 

As of June 30, 2018, the district has invested $58,808,363 in capital assets. This represents a·· 
· net increase of $2,692,230 from last year. (More detailed information about capital assets can be 
found in Note 5 to the financial statements.) Total depreciation expense for the year was 
$1,981,897. 

Long-term Debt 

·At year-end, the district had $33,498,609 in long-term debt, a decrease of 7.19 percent. (More 
detailed information about the district's long-term liabilities is presented in Note 6 to the financial 
statements). 

• The district retired $5, 105,000 of outstanding bonds. 

• Leases payable decreased $4,541,060. 

• Other long-term debt decreased $57,523.

Management Discussion and Analysis 

June 30, 2018 

Factors Bearing on the District's Future 

There are a couple of factors that could significantly affect the district's health in the future: 

• With live births being down and the City starting a period of economic redevelopment and 

as a part of that redevelopment they intend to reduce the amount of government assisted 

housing and replacing with market value housing, it looks to be a period of five to eight 

years of population decline and then new growth. 

" The resurging price of oil reflect better times for the state as oil is a major source of 

income. 

• The District is planning on voting on $80,000,000 in bonds in October, 2019 to start 

repairing and catching up on deferred maintenance.

RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES AND CHANGES 

IN FUND BALANCES OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Net change in fund balances - governmental funds 

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of revenues, expenditures, 

and changes in net assets are different because: 

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in governmental funds 

as expenditures. However, for governmental activities those costs are shown in 

the statement and allocated over their estimated useful lives as annual depreciation 

expenses in the statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in net assets. · 

This is the amount by which depreciation exceeds capital outlays in the period. 

Capital outlay expenditures 
Depreciation expense 

Repayment of bond principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but it reduces 

long-term liabilities in the statement of assets, liabilities, and net assets and does 

not affect the statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in net assets. 

Decrease in deferred revenue in Child Nutrition Fund 

Some property taxes will not be collected for several months after the fiscal 

year ends, and are not considered "available" revenues in the governmental 

funds, but are deferred. They are however, recorded as revenues in the 

Statementof Activities. 

In the statement of activities, certain operating expenses, compensated 

absences and special termination benefits (voluntary separation) 

are measured by the amounts earned during the year. In the 

governmental funds, however, expenditures for these items are 

measured by the amount of financial resources used (essentially, 

the amounts actually paid). Compensated absences used exceed 

the amounts earned by $57,523. 

Payments made on capital leases are expenditures in the governmental 

funds, but the payments reduce long-term liabilities in the statement 

of net position. 

Governmental funds report district pension contributions as expenditures. However, 

the Statement of Activities report the cost of pension benefits earned net of 

employee contributions as pension expense.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



MUSKOGEE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-20 
MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The financial statements of the Muskogee Public Schools Independent District No. 20 (the "District") have 

been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 

("GAAP") as applied to government units. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB") is the 

accepted standard-setting body for establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. 

The District has elected to apply all applicable GASB pronouncements, as well as Financial Accounting 

Standards Board ("FASB") pronouncements and Accounting Principles Board ("APB") opinions, issued on or 

before November 30, 1989, unless those pronouncements conflict with or contradict GASB pronouncements. 

The more significant of the District's accounting policies are described below. · 

A. Reporting Entity 

In accordance with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 14, "The Financial 

Reporting Entity," the District has presented the entities which comprise the primary government in the fiscal 

year combined financial statements. 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and, 

accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the 

public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education 

and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma for support. The general operating authority for the 

public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of five elected members. The 

appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of.America, the combined 

financial statements present the reporting entity which consists of the primary government, organizations for 

which the primary government is financially accountable and other organizations for which the nature and 

significance of their relationship with the primary government are such that exclusion could cause the District's 

combined financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. 

B. Basis of Presentation 

The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the statement of activities) 

report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the school district. For the most part, the effect of 

interfund activity has been removed from these statements. Governmental activities are normally supported 

by taxes and intergovernmental revenues. 

The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or 

segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific 

function. Program revenues include 1) tuition or fees paid by students or citizens of the District and 2) grants 

and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. 

Taxes and other items, including state aid, that are not properly included among program revenues are 

reported as general revenues. 

Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, and fiduciary funds, even though the 

latter are excluded from the government-wide financial statements. 

Fund Financial Statements 

The school district segregates transactions related to certain functions or activities in separate funds in order 

to aid financial management and to demonstrate legal compliance. Statements for governmental activities 

present each fund as a separate column on the fund financial statements. 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities. The 

measurement focus of governmental funds is on the sources uses and balance of current financial resources. 

The school has presented the following governmental funds: 

16 



MUSKOGEE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-20 
MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

General Fund - The General Fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to be 

accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local property taxes and state . 

funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the 

daily operations of the schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school 

construction and debt service on. bonds and other long-term debt. 

Building Fund - The District's Building Fund is a special revenue fund and consists of monies derived from 

property taxes levied for the purpose of creating, remodeling or repairing buildings and for purchasing 

furniture and equipment. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The District's Child Nutrition Fund is a special revenue fund used to account for the 

operations of the child nutrition programs. Revenue sources include meal ticket sales and Federal and State 

grants for free and reduced meals. 

Sinking Fund - The District's Sinking Fund is used to account for the accumulation of financial resources for 

the payment of general long-term debt principal, interest, and related costs. The primary revenue sources are 

local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 

Bond Fund - The District's Bond Fund is used to account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used 

exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing 

facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment. 

Fiduciary Fund Types 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other governments, 

or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms of a formula trust 

agreement, either a private purpose trust fund or a permanent fund is used. 

The terms "permanent" and "private purpose" refer to whether or not the District .is under an obligation to 

maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds on 

behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations. 

The District's Fiduciary Funds have been excluded from the government-wide financial statements. 

Agency Fund - The District's Agency Fund is utilized to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of 

others as their agent and do not involve the measurement of results of operations. 

Private- Purpose Trust Funds - Private-Purpose Trust Funds are used to report trust arrangements 

under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. 

Account Groups 

GASB Statement No. 34 eliminates the presentation of account groups, but provides for these records to be 

maintained and incorporates the information into the governmental column in the government-wide statement 

of net assets. 

C. Basis of Accounting 

The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus 

and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are recorded 

when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash 

flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar 

items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have been 

met. 

17 



MUSKOGEE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-20 
MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement 
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both 
measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are collectible within the 
current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the 
government considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current 
fiscal period. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. 
However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences are recorded 
only when the payment is due. 

Property taxes and interest and certain state and federal grants associated with the current fiscal period are 
all considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal 
period. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by 
the government. 

The District reports deferred revenues on its balance sheet. Deferred revenues arise when resources are 
received by the District before it has a legal claim to them or do not meet the criteria for the recognition of 
revenue. The District has recorded deferred revenues in the General Fund, the Special Revenue Fund, and 
the Debt Service Fund for property taxes, which are not collected within 60 days of year-end. In subsequent 
periods, when both revenue recognition criteria are met, or when the District has a legal claim to the 
resources, the liability for deferred revenues is removed from the balance sheet and revenue is recognized. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Building Fund, Child Nutrition 
Fund, Sinking Fund, and the Bond Fund, that includes revenues and expenditures. These budgets are 
prepared on a modified accrual basis of accounting. Budgetary control is maintained by fund, function, and 
activity and budgeted expenditures may not exceed appropriations at the fund level. Amendments may be 
made to the budget without approval by the governing body at the function and activity levels. Fund level 
budgetary amendments require approval of the governing body. 

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services. Encumbrance 
accounting - under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the expenditure of resources 
are recorded to reserve a portion of the applicable fund balance - is utilized in all governmental funds of the 
District. Appropriations which are not spent lapse at the end of the fiscal year and encumbrances are 
reversed. On the first day of the following fiscal year, the encumbrances are reinstated and the expenditures 
are applied against the year's budget. 

E. Net Position 

The government-wide financial statements utilize a net position presentation. Net position is categories of 
investment in fixed assets (net of related debt), restricted net position and unrestricted net position. 

Investment in Fixed Assets (net of related debt) - is intended to reflect the portion of net position, which is 
associated with non-liquid capital related debt. The net related debt is debt less the outstanding liquid assets 
and any associated unamortized cost. 

Restricted Net Position - are assets the school district is externally or legally prohibited from using for general 
operating purposes. 

Unrestricted Net Position - represent unrestricted liquid assets. 

Fund Balance Policy In Accordance With GASB Statement No. 54 
It is the policy of the District to adopt Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 54 which 

defines how fund balances of the governmental funds are to be presented in the financial statements. The 

governmental fund financial statements present fund balances based on classifications that comprise a· 

hierarchy that is based primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints on the 

specific purposes for which amounts in the respective governmental funds can be spent. The classifications 

used in the governmental fund financial statements are as follows:

MUSKOGEE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-20 
MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Nonspendable Fund Balance - Amounts that are not in a spendable form such as prepaid expenses, and 

consumable inventories are classified as Nonspendable. 

RestriCted Fund Balance - Amounts designated for specific purposes by their providers such as bondholders, 

granters, or imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The District's Building 

Fund balances are restricted by statute to certain capital related costs. The District's Debt Service fund 

balance is restricted by law to purposes of retiring the District's long-term debt. The District's Bond Fund 

balances are restricted by the District voters for specific construction programs. The District's Child Nutrition 

Fund balance is restricted by law to the operations of the District's Child Nutrition programs. 

Committed Fund Balance - Amounts designated for specific purposes by the District's highest level of 

decision-making authority (Board of Education) and cannot be used for any other purposes unless the same 

highest level (Board of Education) takes action to remove or change the designation. The District commits a 

portion of the General Fund balance in accordance with the Board of Education's minimum fund balance 

policy. 

The District commits a portion of the Accrual Basis Fund Balance to honor the commitments made by the 

District for encumbrances (purchase orders) for which goods or services have not yet been received. The 

fund balance committed to encumbrances will be equivalent to the purchase orders rolled forward from one 

fiscal year to the next fiscal year. 

Assigned Fund Balance - Amounts the District intends to use for specific purposes; intent can be expressed 

by the governing body or by an official to which the governing body delegates the authority. The District 

assigns funds for education that are to be used for instruction, support services and other operating 

expenditures. The Superintendent and Chief Financial Officer will determine the amount of assigned fund 

balance at the end of each fiscal year. 

Unassigned Fund Balance - This classification includes the residual fund balance of the General Fund and 

may be used to finance operating expenditures. 

F. Assets, Liabilities and Cash Fund Balances 

Cash - At year-end, the carrying amount of the District's deposits was $1,518, 123 and the bank balance was 

$1,518,123. The bank balance was completely covered by federal depository insurance or by collateral held 

by the District's agent in the District's name. 

Investments - The District had no investments at June 30, 2018. 

Property Tax Revenue and Receivables - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which 

consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon 

receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for 

submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection 

within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of the tax is due prior to January 1. The second half 

is due prior to April 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. The second 

half of the tax becomes delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If taxes are 

delinquent and unpaid for a period of three years or more the real estate may be sold for such taxes. 

Uncollected taxes assessed on valuations made each year are recorded in the Distriet's combined financial 

statements. The delinquent taxes which are not collected within 60 days of year-end are recorded in the 

financial statements as deferred revenue. Uncollectible personal and real property taxes are deemed to be 

immaterial because the property can be sold for the amount of taxes due.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Inventories - Inventories are stated at cost on a first-in, first-out method. Inventories in the governmental 
funds are recorded as expenditures when consumed rather than when purchased. Inventories include fuel, 
instructional and food service supplies. Cost of donated federal surplus commodities is based on values 
established by the federal government at the time of donation. 

Capital Assets - Capital assets, which include property, plant and equipment, are reported in the government-
wide financial statements. 

All purchased capital assets are valued at cost when historical records exist and at an estimated historical 
cost where no historical records exist. Donated capital assets are valued at their fair market value on the date 
donated. 

Assets capitalized have an original cost of $2,500 or more and over three years of useful life. Depreciation 
has been calculated on each class of depreciable property using the straight-line method. Estimated useful 
lives are as follows: 

Buildings and structures 
Improvements 
Equipment 
Furniture and fixtures 

50-100 years 
50-100 years 

10-45 years 
10-15 years 

The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the assets or materially extend 
asset lives are not capitalized. Improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives 
of the related fixed assets, as applicable. 

Compensated Absences - The District's policy allows certified employees to accumulate unused sick leave 
from year to year as long as employees remain continuously in the Muskogee School system. Beginning July 
1, 2012, the maximum number of days that can be accumulated for· purposes of buy back of unused sick 
leave cannot exceed two hundred fifty (250). For the purposes of sick leave reimbursement upon retirement, 
the district pays $50.00/day for all sick leave accrued during employment not previously paid for by the 
Muskogee Public Schools. All certified employees hired after July 1, 2012, are not eligible to sell back unused 
sick leave but will be able to accrue days for use at retirement. 

A twelve-month salaried employee is eligible for thirty (20) days paid vacation each year accrued at the rate of 
1.67 days per month. A twelve-month, eight-hour employee accrues ten (10) vacation days per year at the 
rate of .83 days per month up until completion of five years continuous employment, 5-10 years accrues at 15 
days per year, over 1 O years accrues at 20 days. Twelve month Administrators may carry over vacation days 
up to a maximum of thirty (30) days. Upon retirement or resignation, the School District will reimburse an 
employee for no more than thirty (30) days of accrued vacation at the employee's regular daily rate. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of the applicable governmental activities

MUSKOGEE SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-20 
MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Benefits Funded by the State of Oklahoma: For 2018, the State of Oklahoma contributed estimated 
payments benefiting District employees as follows: 

Plan: Teacher's Retirement System of Oklahoma Amount: $255,231 

The District has recognized the revenues and expenditures related to this on-behalf payment in its financial 
statements. 

Federal Revenues - Revenue from Federal sources is money originating from the Federal government and 
made available to the school district either as direct grants or under various programs passed-through the 
State Department of Education. 

The Federal government also makes payments to school districts whose revenues are adversely affected by 
the presence of Federal activities. Although these payments are made in consideration of lost property tax 
revenue, the Oklahoma State Department of Education advocates classifying such amounts as revenue from 
Federal sources. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly with the interaction 
between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a school classroom, in another 
location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning situations, such as those involving co curricular 
activities. It may also be provided through some other approved medium, such as television, radio, telephone 
and correspondence. Examples of expenditures that might be included here are the activities of teacher 
assistant of any type (clerks, graders, teaching machines, etc.), which assist in the instructional process. The 
activities of tutors, translators, and interpreters would be recorded here. Department chairpersons who teach 
for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/transfer fees paid to other LEAs would be included here. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide administrative, technical (such as 
guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance instruction. These services exist as 

adjuncts for fulfilling the objective of instruction, community services and enterprise programs, rather than as 
entitles within them. 

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures - Activities concerned with providing non-instructional 
services to students, staff, and the community. 

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures - Consist of activities involved with the 
acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of buildings and additions to 
buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in equipment; and improvement to 

sites. 

Other Outlays Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds are not properly classified as 
expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These are classified as Other Outlays. These 
include debt service payments (principal and interest). 

Other Uses Expenditures - This includes scholarships provided by private gifts and endowments; student aid 
and staff awards supported by outside revenue sources (i.e., foundations). Also, expenditures for self-funded 
employee benefit programs administered either by the District or a third party administrator. 

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to outside agencies 
for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayments, non-qualified expenditures, and other 

refunds to be repaid from District funds. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the 
fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The 
State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in 

the general fund.

The School District's lease-purchase commitments include property financed through a technique referred to 
as "conduit financing". Conduit financing involves the use of a public trust, which issues conduit debt 

obligations (limited-obligation revenue bonds, certificates of participation, or similar debt instruments) for the 
express purpose of providing capital financing for a specific third party that is not a part of the issuer's 

financial reporting entity. The public trust has no obligation for such debt ·beyond the resources provided by a 

lease or loan with the third party, on whose behalf the debt is issued.

MUSKOGEE COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Employee Retirement System (continued) 

Basis of Accounting 

The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of 

interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made. 

Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosed 

measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of 

estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date 

and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed on 

individual school districts. The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part 

of the latest actuarial valuation. 

Funding Policy 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. The contribution 

rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes. The 

rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee's earnings plus employer-paid 

fringe benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation. 

Additionally, OTRS receives "federal matching contributions" for positions whose funding comes from federal 

sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable 

compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its 

revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. The District 

contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% 

during this year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System to make the required 

contributions on behalf of the participating members. The school is required to pay 16.5% for any 

compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits. 

Annual Pension Cost 

The District's total contribution for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $3,701,507, $3,450,700, and $4,184,420, 

respectively. The District's total payroll for fiscal year 2017-18 amounted to $25,762,721. 

Teacher's Retirement Offset - The State of Oklahoma credits each certified teacher's retirement account an 

amount set out in statute depending on their years of service. GASB standards require that this be recorded 

as a revenue and expenditure in the financial statements. The District total amount recorded amounted to 

$255,231. 

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 

Resources Related to Pensions 

At June 30, 2018, the school district reported a liability of $44, 108,443 for its proportionate share of the net 

pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total pension liability 

used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 2017. The 

school district's proportion of the net pension liability was based on the school district's contributions received 

by the pension plan relative to the total contributions received by pension plan for all participating employers 

as of June 30, 2017. Based upon this information, the District's proportion was .6661582 percent.

2018. The deferred outflows totaling $7,385,330 resulting from the difference between projected and actual 

earnings on pension plan investments and changes of assumptions and difference between proportionate 

share of contributions and changes in proportion will be recognized in pension expense over five years. The 

deferred inflows totaling $6, 146,37 4 resulting from differences between expected and actual experience; 

changes of assumptions and differences in District's proportionate share of contributions and changes in 

proportion will be recognized in pension expense using the average expected remaining service life of the 

plan participants. The average expected remaining life of the plan participants is determined by taking the 

calculated total future service years of the plan participants divided by the number of people in the Plan 

including retirees. The total future service years of the plan participants are estimated at 5.59 years at Ju·ne 

30, 2017, and are determined using the mortality, termination, retirement and disability assumptions 

associated with the Plan.

Actuarial assumptions: The total pension liability was determined based on an actuarial valuation prepared 

as of July 1, 2017, using the following actual assumptions: 

• Actuarial Cost method-Entry Age Normal 

• Amortization Method-Level Percentage of Payroll 

• Amortization Period-Amortization over an open 30-year period 

• Asset Valuation Method-5 year smooth market 

• lnflation-2.5 percent 
• Salary Increases-Composed of 3.25 percent wage inflation, including 2.5 percent price inflation, 

plus a service related component up to 8 percent based on years of service. 

• Investment Rate of Return-7.5% 

• Retirement Age-Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted by 

the Board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five year experience study for the period ending 

June 30, 2014 
• Males: RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table for males with white collar adjustments. 

Generations 1 mortality improvements in accordance with scale BB from the table's base year of 

2000. Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, scaled at 105%. Generational 

mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table's base year of 2012. 

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building block 

method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension 

plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are 

combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of 

return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation.

Discount rate - A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 

2016. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on pension plan investments 

of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the pension plan's fiduciary net 

position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future benefit 

payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 

investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine total pension liability.

Pension plan fiduciary net position - Detailed information about the pension plan's fiduciary net position is 

available in the separately issued TRS financial report that can be obtained at http://www.ok.gov/trs/ or by 

writing to the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73152 or 

by calling 405-521-2387. 

9. OPEB 

Plan Description - The District as the employer, participates in the Supplemental Health Insurance 

Program - a cost sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Oklahoma 

Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). Title 74 0. S. Sec. 1316.3 defines the health insurance benefits. The 

authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a publicly 

available financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/OTRS 

Benefits Provided - OTRS pays a medical insurance supplement to eligible members who elect to continue 

their employer provided health insurance. The supplement payment is between $100 and $105 per month, 

remitted to the Oklahoma Management Enterprise Services Employees Group Insurance Division, provided 

the member has ten (10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement. 

Contributions - Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 

contained in Title 70, as amended. However the statutes do not specify or identify any particular contribution 

source to pay the health insurance subsidy. Based on the contribution requirements of Title 70 employers and 

employees contribute a single amount based on a single contribution rate as described in Note 7; from this 

amount OTRS allocates a portion of the contributions to the supplemental health insurance program. The cost 

of the supplemental health insurance program averages 1.5% of normal cost, as determined by an actuarial 

valuation. Contributions allocated to the OPES plan from the District were $36, 132. 

OPES Liabilities (Assets), OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 

Resources Related to OPES - At June 30, 2018, the District reported an asset of $297,068 for its 

proportionate share of the new OPES asset. The net OPES asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and 

the total OPES asset used to calculate the net OPES asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 

June 30, 2017. The District's proportion of the net OPES asset was based on the District's contributions 

received by the OPES plan relative to the total contributions received by the OPEB plan for all participating 

employers as of June 30, 2017. Based upon this information, the District's proportion was .666159% percent. 

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District recognized OPES expense of ($2,318). At June 30, 2018, the 

District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPES from .the

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Discount Rate - A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total OPRB liability (asset) as of 

June 30, 2018. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on OPEB plan 

investments of 7.50%. 

Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position and 

future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future payments of current plan 

members. Therefore, the long term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all 

periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability (asset). The projection of cash 

flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member and employer contributions will 

be made at the statutory levels and remain a level percentage of payrolls. The projection of cash flows also 

assumed that the State's contribution plus the matching contributions will remain a constant percent of 

projected member payroll based on the past five years of actual contributions. 

Sensitivity of the Net OPEB Liability (Asset) to Changes in the Discount Rate - The following presents the net 

OPEB liability (asset) of the employer calculated using the discount rate of 7.5%, as well as what the Plan's 

net OPEB liability (asset) would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point higher 

(8.5%) than the current rate and what it would be using a discount rate that 1 percentage-point lower (6.5%) 

than the current rate:

10. Contingencies 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor 

agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the 

applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures that may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be 

determined at this time, although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 

The District is a defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 

determinable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on 

the financial condition of the District. Also, in the event of any unfavorable outcomes, the-District and its legal 

counsel believe that adequate insurance coverage exists and that there will be no adverse economic impact 

on the financial condition of the District.

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; 

errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commertial insurance to 

cover these risks. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance 

coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is transfer or 

pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASB No. 10, the School reports the 

required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 

Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' compensation 

coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. 

In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including 

obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and 

legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the 

District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the 

fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by 

projecting losses based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of 

the Loss Fund, so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District 

does not use their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE.AND OTHERMATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH . 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Muskogee School District No. 1-20 
Muskogee County, Oklahoma 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, 
each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Muskogee School District No. 1-20, Muskogee 
County, Oklahoma (District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial 
statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and have issued my report thereon 
dated January 22, 2019. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing my opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements 
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency; or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than .<;i material weakness, yet important enough 
to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that I 
consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

56 



Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements 
are free of material 

misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant 

agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determ
ination of financial 

statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was
 not an objective of 

my, audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclo
sed no instances of 

noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing St
andards. 

Purpose of this Report 

This report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance an
d the results of that 

testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or o
n compliance. This 

report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Stan
dards in considering 

the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for
 any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF 

FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Muskogee School District No. 1-20 
Muskogee County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the compliance of Muskogee School District No. 1-20, Muskogee County, Oklahoma (District's) 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District's major federal 
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of 
auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 
applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs based on 
my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit requirements 
of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Aqministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, 
and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and Uniform Guidance require 
that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major program 
occurred. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as I consider necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal program. 
However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, Muskogee School District, No. 1-20, Muskogee County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material 
respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect 
on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

58 



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of Muskogee School District No. 1-20,. Muskogee County, Oklahoma (District), is responsible for 

establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements 

referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District's internal control 

over compliance with the types of requirements that could have. a direct and material effect on. each major federal 
program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 

expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on iriternal control 

over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 

effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, l do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 

the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance 

does not allow management .or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 

or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program, on a timely 
basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in 

internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type 

of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on, a timely basis. 

A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in 
internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe 

than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those 

charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 

this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 

compliance that I considered to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not 
been identified. · 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of 

internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. 
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
