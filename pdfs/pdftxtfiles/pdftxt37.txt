Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Oklahoma County School District No. I-89 
 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and 
the aggregate remaining fund information of the Oklahoma County School District No. I-89 (the District) as of 
and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to financial statements, which collectively 
comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of 
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those 
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation 
of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a reasonable basis 
for our audit opinions. 
 
Opinions 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 
financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information 
of the District, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended, in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
Emphasis of Matters 
As discussed in Note 9, the District adopted GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for 
Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. In 
addition, as discussed in Note 14, the District reclassified the School Nutrition Services Fund from an 
Enterprise Fund to a Special Revenue Fund. This reclassification required the District to restate beginning net 
position of the governmental activities, business-type activities and the aggregate remaining fund information. 
Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.



 

2 

Other Matters 
Required Supplementary Information 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 
discussion and analysis, the schedule of the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability, the 
schedule of the District’s contributions to Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System, the schedule of the District’s 
proportionate share of the Net OPEB Liability (Asset), the schedule of the District’s contributions to the OPEB 
Trust, and the budgetary comparison schedule for the General Fund as listed in the table of contents, be 
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic 
financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an 
essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, 
economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary 
information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which 
consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the 
information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and 
other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion 
or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient 
evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 
 
Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the District’s basic financial statements. The combining financial statements, statement of changes in 
assets and liabilities for fiduciary funds, and budgetary schedules, listed in the table of contents as other 
supplementary information, and the accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by 
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards are presented for purposes of additional analysis and 
are not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management 
and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements. These statements and schedules have been subjected to the auditing procedures 
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing 
and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements, or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, these 
statements and schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements 
as a whole. 
 
The accompanying Introductory and Other Information sections, as listed in the table of contents, have not 
been subjected to the procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated February 8, 2019, 
on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance 
with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of 
that report is to solely describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s 
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial 
reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
For Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 

3 

Within the management’s discussion and analysis of the Oklahoma County School District No. I-89 (the 
District) annual financial report, the District’s management provides narrative discussion and analysis of 
the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The District’s financial 
performance is discussed and analyzed within the context of the accompanying financial statements 
following this section. The reports are prepared using the integrated approach as prescribed by 
Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements—and 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis—for State and Local Governments, which also requires that 
certain comparative information between the current year and the prior year be presented. 
 
Unless specifically stated otherwise, all dollar amounts in this management’s discussion and analysis are 
expressed in thousands. 
 
Financial Highlights 
Key financial highlights for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were: 
 
 The District’s Statement of Net Position (accrual basis) reported that assets and deferred outflows 

exceeded liabilities and deferred inflows by $429.7 million (net position) an increase of $23 million, 
or 5.7 percent over the previous year end net position of $406.3 million. 

 
 General fund expenditures (budgetary basis) of $313.4 million were less than total revenues 

(revenues plus lapsed appropriations) of $323.4 million by $10 million, or 3.1 percent of total 
revenues. The fund balance increased to $26.7 million, or 8.5 percent of total expenditures. 
 

 The District’s Bond Ratings were upgraded by Standard & Poor’s from a bond rating of AA Negative 
to a bond rating of AA Stable.  
 

 Student membership totaled 38,762, a decrease of 1,217 students, or 3 percent, from last year’s 
membership of 39,979. Membership and attendance are the critical components in the calculation 
of the District’s revenue allocations. 

 
Overview of the Financial Statements 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial 
statements, which are comprised of three components: 1) district-wide financial statements, 2) fund 
financial statements and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains required and other 
supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements. 
 
District-Wide Financial Statements 
The district-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the 
District’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
 
The Statement of Net Position presents information on all of the District’s assets, deferred outflows/ 
inflows of resources and liabilities, with the difference reported as net position. Over time, increases or 
decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the District is 
improving or deteriorating. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information reflecting how the District’s net position changed during 
the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event 
giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, some revenues and 
expenses reported in this statement will result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected 
taxes).

The district-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the District that are principally supported by 
property taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental activities). 
 
The governmental activities of the District include regular education, special education, school nutrition 
services, transportation and administration.  
 
The district-wide financial statements can be found on pages 16 and 17. 
 
Fund Financial Statements 
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been 
segregated for specific activities or objectives. The District uses fund accounting to ensure and 
demonstrate compliance with finance-related laws and regulations. Within the basic financial statements, 
fund financial statements focus on the District’s most significant funds rather than the District as a whole. 
Major funds are separately reported while all others are combined into a single, aggregated presentation. 
 
The District has two kinds of funds: 
 
Governmental funds are reported in the fund financial statements and encompass essentially the same 
functions reported as governmental activities in the district-wide financial statements. However, unlike the 
district-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on short-term inflows and 
outflows of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of 
the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating the District’s short-term financing 
requirements. Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as regular education, special 
education, transportation and administration. Property taxes, federal grants, state grants and state aid 
formula provide the financing for most of these activities. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the district-wide financial statements, it 
is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented 
for governmental activities in the district-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better 
understand the long-term impact of the government’s short-term financing decisions. The Governmental 
Funds Balance Sheet and the Governmental Funds Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes 
in Fund Balances each provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds 
and governmental activities. 
 
The Governmental Funds Balance Sheet and Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in 
Fund Balances are presented on pages 18 and 20. Major funds are presented separately, and non-major 
governmental funds are combined into a single column. Individual fund data for each of these non-major 
governmental funds are provided in a combining statement on pages 61 and 62.  
 
Fiduciary funds are funds for which the District is the trustee or fiduciary for assets that belong to others. 
The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets of the funds are used only for their intended 
purposes and by whom the assets belong. The District maintains one fiduciary fund, which is the student 
activity fund. Fiduciary fund financial statements report resources that are not available to fund District 
programs and, as a result, are not included in the district-wide financial statements. 
 
The basic fiduciary fund financial statement can be found on page 22.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data provided in 
the district-wide and fund financial statements. Notes to the financial statements can be found on pages 
23 through 51. 
 
Required Supplementary Information 
The Required Supplementary Information (RSI) section presents information concerning the District’s 
budgeting process. The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for the following funds: general 
fund, building fund, school nutrition fund, bond funds, debt service fund and insurance fund.  
 
The District is required to present a budget to actual comparison schedule for both the general fund and 
each major special revenue fund with a legally adopted annual budget. A budgetary comparison schedule 
has been provided for the general fund, to demonstrate compliance with the budgets. There are no major 
special revenue funds with a legally adopted annual budget. 
 
Pension and OPEB information is also included in required supplementary information. 
 
Other Supplementary Information 
The Other Supplementary Information section presents the detailed by non-major Other Governmental 
Funds Balance Sheet and Revenues and Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances, The Fiduciary 
Statement of Changes in Assets and Liabilities, and budgetary comparison schedules for the non-major 
special revenue funds and other funds: building fund, bond funds, debt service fund and insurance fund. 
 
District-Wide Financial Analysis 
The following financial analysis discussion reports the District’s comparative results for Governmental 
Activites. As year-to-year financial information is accumulated on a consistent basis, changes in net 
position may be observed and used to discuss the changing financial position of the District as a whole. 
 
Net Position 
The District’s total net position at June 30, 2018 and 2017 was $429.7 million and $406.3 million, 
respectively. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, net position increased $23.4 million or 
5.8 percent. As a result of GASB Statement No. 68, the District is unable to report positive unrestricted 
net position. 
 
The largest portion of the District’s net position, $592 million (137.7 percent of total net position), reflects 
its net investment in capital assets. The District uses these capital assets to provide instruction, support 
and transportation services; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although 
the District’s investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the 
resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets 
themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. 
 
Detailed financial information is available on page 16.

Governmental Activities

 
 
Deferred Outflows of $65.9 million consist of unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense 
and contributions from the employer to the pension and OPEB plans after the measurement date but 
before the end of the employer’s reporting period. Deferred outflows of $1.0 million relates to debt 
refunding and equals the difference between the re-acquisition price and the net carrying amount of old 
debt. The deferred outflows will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the old 
debt or the life of the new debt, whichever is shorter. 
 
Deferred Inflows of $121 million were recorded related to future property tax collections as projected 
based on the Oklahoma County lien date of January 1, 2018 as these will not be recognized as revenue 
until the year for which it is budgeted. Deferred inflows of $60.7 million were recorded related to 
unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense and OPEB expense.

Financial Analysis of the District’s Funds 
Governmental funds: The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on short-
term inflows, outflows and balances of spendable resources. Long-term financial reporting, such as fixed 
assets and long-term debt, are adjusted back to revenue and expenditures to reflect only short-term 
activity. Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing requirements. In particular, 
unassigned fund balances may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for 
spending at the end of the fiscal year. See pages 18 and 20 for detailed reporting. 
 
The District’s main sources of revenues by category are: 
 

 Local (including ad valorem, tuition and fees, investment earnings, rentals, and reimbursements) 

 Intermediate (including County Four Mill Ad Valorem) 

 State (including state taxes and fees, state aid, state grants, state programs) 

 Federal (federal programs, projects, services, and activities) 

 Charter School (flow-through of charter school state formula funding) 

 Other (reimbursements and other miscellaneous revenues) 
 
Other financing sources of governmental funds include bond sales, revenue transfers between funds, and 
insurance recoveries.

The District’s main activities by function are instruction, support services, noninstructional services, 
facilities acquisition and construction, other outlays (charter school pass-through), and debt service. The 
following table shows each activity’s total cost before any offsets for fees generated by the activities and 
intergovernmental aid provided for specific programs, as well as the financial burden that was placed on 
the State of Oklahoma, federal government, and the District’s taxpayers by each of these functions.

General Fund Budget Discussion 
Under the required supplementary information section (pages 58 through 60); the General Fund is 
presented on a budgetary basis. Annually, the District files a budget overview in accordance with the 
School District Budget Act (Section 5-150 et. Seq. of Title 70) adopted June 4, 2001. 
 
The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for all required funds. The budget is prepared in 
accordance with Oklahoma law and is based on accounting for financial transactions on a basis of cash 
receipts, disbursements and encumbrances. 
 
Revenue 
State sources of revenue (the primary source of District revenues) are budgeted conservatively. Total 
state foundation incentive and flexible benefit allowance funding is driven by changes in District WADM 
(Weighted Average Daily Membership), and Foundation and Salary Incentive Aid factors in state 
appropriated funding 
 
Federal sources of revenue are budgeted each year to allow an appropriation authorization to expend the 
full potential allocation of all federal programs. Any unspent allocations are carried forward into the next 
fiscal year for use. The budgeted amount is based on estimated FY2018 spending and historical program 
appropriations trends at the time of the budget preparation. 
 
Expenditures 
Instructional expenditures mirror the federal sources of revenue budgeting process to allow appropriation 
authorization to expend the full potential allocation of all federal programs. Federal sources of revenue 
impact the classroom and instructional setting. As federal actual revenues are less than budget, a direct 
correlation occurs with instructional expenditures actuals being less than budgeted. Other expenditures 
are budgeted based on historical trend information and projections for potential increases or decreases 
for student services and staffing costs.

Economic Outlook 
During April 2018, the Oklahoma state legislature passed bills 1010xx, 1023xx and 1026xx approving tax 
initiatives to generate approximately $505 million in additional revenue dedicated for salary increases for 
teachers and support staff.  With this influx of new revenues, the District’s state formula funding increased 
by over $20 million for the subsequent school year beginning July 1, 2018.  The District successfully 
implemented the legislative salary increases for all eligible certified and support staff. 
 
The State of Oklahoma is continuing to experience encouraging economic news.  As reported by State 
Treasurer, Randy McDaniel, gross receipts were nearly $13 billion during calendar year 2018 and grew at 
a double-digit pace; increasing by more than $1.5 billion or 13.2 percent compared to calendar year 2017 
collections.  The state economic improvement is also reflected in a decrease in unemployment.  
Oklahoma’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent in November 2018 as compared to the U.S. jobless rate of 
3.7 percent.  
 
Looking forward, the Oklahoma State Board of Education approved a Fiscal Year 2020 budget request of 
$3.35 billion for common education, which includes an increase of more than $440.6 million.  The 
request,among the largest ever for common education, seeks to reduce class sizes and boost critical 
funding for instruction to support Oklahoma teachers and students after years of severe budget cuts.   
 
School state funding is highly dependent on student enrollment and district enrollment continues to 
decline.  District leadership will continue to carefully evaluate legislative activity and monitor revenues and 
expenditures to ensure that the financial resources are aligned to meet our student’s academic and 
emotional needs.

Reconciliation of Total Governmental Fund Balances to Net Position
of Governmental Activities
June 30, 2018
(in thousands)

Total governmental fund balances 201,972  $                 

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement
of net position are different because:

Capital assets used in governmental activities are not financial resources 
and, therefore, are not reported as assets in the governmental funds. 

Cost of capital assets 972,576  $                 
Accumulated depreciation (277,129)                    695,447                     

Other long-term assets are not available to pay for current-period 
expenditures and, therefore, are deferred in the funds.

Delinquent/protested property taxes, net of allowance 9,027                         
Due from other governments 18                              
Net other post-employment benefits 2,048                         11,093                       

Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources are not due and payable in the current year and, therefore, 
are not reported in the governmental funds, as follows:

Deferred outflows of resources, debt refunding related amounts 991                            
Deferred outflows of resources, pension related amounts 65,579                       
Deferred outflows of resources, net other post-employment benefits 299                            
Deferred inflows of resources, net other post-employment benefits (1,670)                        
Deferred inflows of resources, pension related amounts (58,996)                      6,203                         

Long-term liabilities, including bonds payable, are not due and
payable in the current period and, therefore, are not reported as 
liabilities in the funds.  Long-term liabilities consist of:

General obligation bonds payable (166,860)                    
Premium on bonds  (4,612)                        
Capital lease obligation (729)                           
Compensated absences (6,472)                        
Net pension liability (303,608)                    
Accrued interest (2,762)                        (485,043)                    

Net position of governmental activities 429,672  $

Reconciliation of the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund
Balances of Governmental Funds to the Statement of Activities
Year Ended June 30, 2018
(in thousands)

Net changes in fund balances - total governmental funds 25,692  $                   

Amounts reported for governmental activities and the statement of activities
are different because:

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets  are reported in governmental
funds as expenditures. However, for governmental activities, those costs are
shown in the statement of net position and allocated over their estimated
useful lives as annual depreciation expense in the statement activities. This is 
the amount by which the capital outlays exceeded depreciation and retirements
in the period.

Capital outlay expenditures capitalized 35,711  $                   
Depreciation expense (22,223)                      
Contributed capital 2,865                         
Loss on sale of capital assets (517)                           15,836                       

Repayments of principal on long-term debt are expenditures in governmental
funds but reduce long-term liabilities in the statement of net position and do
not affect the statement of activities. Also, governmental funds report the
effect of premiums, discounts, and similar items when debt is first issued,
whereas these amounts are deferred and amortized in the statement of
activities. Proceeds from the sale of new bonds are other financing sources
in the governmental funds but have no impact on the statements of activities.

Principal payments and amortization of bond premium 30,959                       
Proceeds from the sale of bonds and premium on the issuance of bonds (44,865)                      
Capital lease payments 406                            (13,500)                      

Because some revenues (property taxes and certain other income) will not be
collected for several months after the District's fiscal year ends, they are not
considered as "available" revenues in the governmental funds and are instead
deferred inflows of resources. They are, however, recorded as revenues in
the statement of activities. (5,083)                        

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of
current financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures
in governmental funds.

Compensated absences (182)                           
Interest expense recognized in the statement of activities (1,736)                        
Net other post-employment benefit expense 677                            
Pension expense, net of state on-behalf payments of $14.4 million 1,678                         

Change in net position of governmental activities 23,382  $

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of operations: Oklahoma County School District No. I-89, Oklahoma City Public Schools (the 
District), is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of Oklahoma Statutes and, 
accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the 
public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education. The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma 
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The District is a primary government that has a 
separately elected governing body, is legally separate and is fiscally independent of other state or local 
governments. The governing body of the District, the Board of Education, is composed of elected 
members. The Superintendent is appointed by the Board and is the chief executive officer of the District. 
 
Significant accounting policies: The accounting and reporting policies of the District conform to 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for state and local governments. 
Generally accepted accounting principles for school districts are defined as those principles promulgated 
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). 
 
Significant accounting and reporting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial 
statements are as follows: 
 
Reporting entity: As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, the basic financial statements present the reporting entity, which consists of the primary 
government, organizations for which the primary government is financially accountable, and other 
organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the primary government are 
such that exclusion would cause the District’s basic financial statements to be misleading. The District 
has not identified any organizations that should be included in the District’s reporting entity.  
 
Affiliated organizations: A foundation associated with the District is the Foundation for Oklahoma City 
Public Schools (the Foundation) established in 1984. Advisory Board Members for the Foundation include 
the District’s Superintendent and Board Chairperson. The District’s Board of Education does not exercise 
any oversight authority over the Foundation, and there are no financial interdependencies. The 
Foundations’ financial statements are not included in the financial statements of the District because the 
resources held by the Foundation for the benefit of the District are not significant to the financial position 
or activities of the District as a whole.  
 
A nonprofit organization associated with the District is Fields & Futures established in 2012 to "help 
OKCPS put more students on a better path to graduation by growing sports participation at the middle 
school and high school levels". The District’s Board of Education does not exercise any oversight 
authority over Fields & Futures and there are no financial interdependencies. The Fields & Futures’ 
financial statements are not included in the financial statements of the District because the resources held 
by Fields & Futures for the benefit of the District are not significant to the financial position or activities of 
the District as a whole. 
 
District-wide and fund financial statements: The district-wide financial statements (the statement of 
net position and the statement of activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the 
District. Essentially all interfund activity has been removed from these statements. Governmental 
activities, which normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported 
separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for 
support. The District does not report any business-type activities.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function or 
segments are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a 
specific function or segment. Program revenues include 1) charges to customers or applicants who 
purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or 
segment and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital 
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items not properly included among 
program revenues are reported instead as general revenues. 
 
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds and fiduciary funds, even though the 
latter are excluded from the district-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental funds are 
reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements. 
 
Governmental funds: Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of the government’s 
general activities, including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue 
funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital project funds), and the servicing of 
general long-term debt (debt service funds). 
 
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 
 
 General Fund: The General Fund is established as the District’s primary operating fund and is used 

to account for all financial transactions except for those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
Major revenue sources include local property taxes, state funding under the foundation and incentive 
aid program, and federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs. 

 
 2007 Bond Funds: The 2007 Bond Funds, capital projects funds, are established to account for the 

various general obligation bond sale proceeds and expenditures as authorized by the voters on 
October 9, 2007.  These resources are used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and 
equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, enhancing safety and security, and 
acquiring technology and transportation equipment. The total bond issue authorized by the voters 
was $248.3 million, and consisted of the following separately approved propositions: 

 
 Proposition 1: $212 million for capital improvements for elementary school gymnasiums, 54 new 

classrooms, and routine maintenance; 

 Proposition 2: $21 million to provide network system upgrades to better track and evaluate 
students and update and add library materials; 

 Proposition 3: $7.3 million to replace school buses more than 10 years old and update the support 
vehicle fleet; and 

 Proposition 4: $8 million to improve safety and security equipment throughout the District. 
 
 Debt Service Fund: The Debt Service Fund (the Sinking Fund) is established to account for the local 

property tax proceeds levied specifically for debt service retirement and related investment interest 
earnings and the general obligation bond debt obligations and payments.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 2016 Bond Funds: The 2016 Bond Funds, capital projects funds, are established to account for the 
various general obligation bond sale proceeds and expenditures as authorized by the voters on 
November 8, 2016.  These resources are used exclusively for maintaining, renovating, and equipping 
school facilities, enhancing safety and security, and acquiring technology and transportation 
equipment. The total bond issue authorized by the voters was $180 million, and consisted of the 
following separately approved propositions: 
 
 Proposition 1:  $106.34 million for school building maintenance, including roofing, heating, air 

conditioning, safety improvements, and general equipment; 

 Proposition 2:  $54.46 million for technology infrastructure upgrades, student and testing labs, and 
computers; 

 Proposition 3:  $19.20 million to replace school buses and update the support vehicle fleet. 
 
The District reports the following non-major governmental funds: 
 
 Building Fund: The Building Fund, a special revenue fund, is established to account for the 

proceeds of the local property taxes levied specifically for the Building Fund. These resources may be 
used for building operations and maintenance including supplies, services and personnel. 

 
 School Nutrition Services: The School Nutrition Services program, a special revenue fund, is 

established to account for revenues collected, including federal and state, for meals served, and for 
associated costs of the program. 

 
 MAPS Sales Tax Fund: The MAPS Sales Tax Fund, a special revenue fund, was established to 

account for capital assets and other tangible property funded from the Oklahoma City limited purpose 
sales tax levied January 2002 through January 2009. As the District receives transfers from the City 
of Oklahoma City and/or property is placed into service, the District records an asset or expenditure 
with the related in-kind revenue entry to comply with generally accepted accounting principles. 

 
 Gifts and Endowments Fund: The Gifts and Endowments Fund, a special revenue fund, is 

established to account for any receipt of assets by way of philanthropic foundations, individuals, or 
private organizations for which no repayment or special service to the contributor is expected. Income 
derived from such funds may be expended, but the principal must remain intact. 

 
 2001 Bond Funds: The 2001 Bond Funds, capital projects funds, are established to account for the 

various general obligation bond sale proceeds and expenditures as authorized by the voters on 
November 13, 2001.  These resources are used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing 
and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring equipment. The total 
bond issue of $180 million was for the approved proposition of $163.3 million for the construction of 
new and/or renovation of 16 school buildings and $16.7 million for computer and other technology, 
equipment, software renovations and improvements. 

 
 Casualty Flood Insurance Recovery Fund: The Casualty Flood Insurance Recovery Fund, a capital 

projects fund, was established July 2, 2007 by Board of Education Resolution in order to establish a 
reserve for repairs or replacement of District property that has been destroyed or damaged or lost by 
a hazard or cause which is either excluded from coverage in the policy of the insurance procured by 
the District or which falls within the self-insured retention (deductible) of the policy.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
Fiduciary funds: Fiduciary funds are comprised entirely of agency-type funds and are not included in the 
district-wide financial statements. Agency funds are custodial in nature (assets equal liabilities) and do not 
involve recognition of net position or measurement of operations. The District reports the following 
fiduciary fund: 
 
 School Activity Fund: The School Activity Fund is an agency fund established to account for all 

financial transactions related to the fund-raising efforts of students and District-sponsored groups. 
 
Basis of accounting, measurement focus, and financial statement presentation: The government-
wide statement of net position and statement of activities financial statements are reported on the accrual 
basis of accounting using the economic resources measurement focus. Revenues are recorded when 
earned, and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash 
flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are budgeted. Grants and 
similar items are recognized as revenues as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider 
have been met. 
 
The Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds and Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in 
Fund Balances - Governmental Funds financial statements are reported on the modified accrual basis of 
accounting using the current financial resources measurement focus. Revenues are recognized as soon 
as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they are 
collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. 
 
All revenues are considered available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal 
period. Property tax and other revenues collected within the time frame noted are therefore susceptible to 
accrual and have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal period to the extent the availability 
criteria discussed above was met. 
 
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, 
debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences, pensions and other 
post-employment benefit obligations, are only recorded when the payment is due. 
 
The Statement of Assets and Liabilities - Agency Fund financial statements do not have an economic 
measurement focus and, therefore, have no measurement disclosures. 
 
Cash and cash equivalents and investments: The District considers all cash on hand, demand 
deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, high yield savings accounts, and highly liquid investments 
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents.  
As of June 30, 2018, the Districts investments were in sweep accounts which meet the definition of cash 
equivalents and certificates of deposit which are classified as investments. Investments are recorded at 
amortized cost. 
 
Receivables: Uncollected taxes assessed on valuations made each year are recorded in the District’s 
financial statements. An allowance for doubtful accounts for property taxes receivable is calculated based 
on an aged analysis of protested and delinquent tax receivables and historical collection data.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
Interfund transactions: Activity between funds that are representative of lending/borrowing 
arrangements outstanding at the end of the fiscal year are referred to as due to/from other funds. There 
were no amounts due to/from other funds as of June 30, 2018. Transfers move revenues from the fund 
statutorily required to collect the resources to the fund statutorily required to expend the resources. 
Transfers within governmental activities are eliminated upon consolidation. During the year ended 
June 30, 2018, there were no interfund transactions. 
 
Inventories: Inventories are carried at cost (FIFO method, or first-in, first-out) and are recorded as 
expenditures when consumed rather than when purchased. Inventories include fuel, maintenance stock, 
and food service supplies. 
 
Capital assets: Capital assets, which include land, buildings, and improvements; machinery and 
equipment; vehicles; and computers and technology, are reported in the district-wide financial statements. 
Capital assets are defined by the District as assets with an initial unit cost or an estimated acquisition 
value at the date of donation equal to or greater than $5,000 (not in thousands). 
 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or do not materially 
extend an asset’s life are not capitalized. 
 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as the projects are constructed. 
Interest incurred during the construction phase of capital assets of business-type activities is included as 
part of the capitalized value of the assets constructed. The District incurred no interest expense for 
construction of capital assets for business-type activities during the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following useful lives: 
 
 

Type of Asset  Years 

 Buildings 50
 Land improvements 15
 Machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures 10
 Vehicles 10
 Technology, appliances, and musical instruments 5  
 
Deferred outflows of resources: In addition to assets, the statement of net position will sometimes report 
a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element 
represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s). It will not be recognized as an 
outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then. Deferred outflows of resources include the debt 
refunding loss equal to the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of the 
old debt. The deferred outflow will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the remaining 
life of the old debt or the life of the new debt, whichever is shorter. Deferred outflows of resources also 
consist of unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense and contributions from the employer 
after the measurement date but before the end of the employer’s reporting period. See Note 8 for 
additional discussion regarding pension deferred outflows of resources. In addition, the District has 
reported deferred outflows of resources for contributions made subsequent to the measurement date for 
its other post-employment benefit liability. See Note 9 for additional discussion.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
Deferred inflows of resources: In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position and fund balance 
sheet will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial 
statement element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s). It will not be 
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until then. The governmental fund balance sheet includes 
unavailable revenues from delinquent property taxes, succeeding year property taxes, and 
intergovernmental revenue. These amounts are deferred and recognized as an inflow of resources in the 
period that the amounts become available. In the District’s district-wide statement of net position, the 
property tax revenues for the succeeding year remain a deferred inflow and will be recognized as revenue 
in the year for which they are budgeted. The district-wide statement of net position also consists of 
deferred inflows related to unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense. See Note 8 for 
additional discussion regarding pension deferred inflows of resources. In addition, the District has 
reported deferred inflows of resources related to unrecognized items not yet charged to expense related 
to its other post-employment benefits. See Note 9 for additional discussion. 
 
Long-term liabilities: In the governmental fund financial statements, principal and interest on long-term 
debt and other long-term obligations are recognized as liabilities only when payment has matured or 
become due. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums received 
on debt issuances are also reported as other financing sources. Discounts are reported as other financing 
uses. Principal payments and bond issuance costs are reported as debt service expenditures.  
 
Long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as liabilities in the governmental activities, 
business-type activities, and proprietary fund statement of net position. Bond premiums and discounts are 
amortized over the life of the debt using a method which approximates the effective interest method. 
Bond issue costs are recorded as an expense when incurred. 
 
Pensions: For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows/inflows of resources 
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of Oklahoma 
Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions to/deductions from these fiduciary net positions has 
been determined on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments 
(including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with 
the benefit terms. Investments held by OTRS are reported at fair value. 
 
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB): For purposes of measuring the net OPEB 
liability, deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about 
the fiduciary net position of Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions to/deductions 
from these fiduciary net positions has been determined on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. 
For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when 
due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments held by OTRS are reported at fair 
value. 
 
Compensated absences: The liability for compensated absences attributable to the District’s 
governmental funds is recorded in the district-wide financial statements. Vested compensated absence 
balances are reported as a long-term liability with an estimated short-term portion recorded as due within 
one year.  
 
Equalized pay: Oklahoma City Public Schools utilizes equalized pay to provide equal base pay amounts 
each pay period to employees throughout the year including intercession periods.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
To provide equalized base pay throughout the year, including times when employees do not work, a 
liability account is maintained for each employee who has a specific annual work schedule. The liability 
account increases when the employee earns more than equalized base pay and decreases when the 
employee is not working as many days in a pay period, or is not working at all during intercession periods. 
This account is zero at the end of the contract year, which is different than the fiscal year.  
 
Net position and fund balance: The district-wide financial statements utilize a net position presentation. 
Net position is categorized as net investment in capital assets, restricted, and unrestricted. 
 
 Net investment in capital assets: This component of net position reports capital assets less both 

accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balance of debt (excluding unexpended proceeds) that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Deferred 
outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction, or improvement of those assets or related debt are also included in this component of 
net position, if any. 

 
 Restricted net position: This component of net position should be reported when constraints placed 

on the use of resources are either (a) externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws 
or regulations of other governments or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or 
enabling legislation. The restricted net position for other purposes is made up of the following: student 
services $31; and state allocation carryover $2,242. 

 
Net position totaling $11,609 is restricted by enabling legislation. The remaining $58,860 is restricted 
by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments. 

 
 Unrestricted net position: Net position that does not meet the definition of net investment in capital 

assets or restricted are classified as unrestricted. 
 
It is the District’s policy to first use restricted net position prior to the use of unrestricted net position when 
an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net position are available. 
 
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Fund balance consists of five categories, defined 
as follows: 
 
 Nonspendable fund balance: The nonspendable fund balance classification includes amounts that 

cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually 
required to be maintained intact. This would include items not expected to be converted to cash 
including inventories, long-term receivables, and prepaid amounts. It may also include long-term 
loans and receivables, as well as property acquired for resale and the corpus (principal) of a 
permanent fund. 

 
 Restricted fund balance: The restricted fund balance classification should be reported when 

constraints placed on the use of resources are either (a) externally imposed by creditors, grantors, 
contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or (b) imposed by law through constitutional 
provisions or enabling legislation.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

 Committed fund balance: The committed fund balance classification reflects specific purposes 
pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the District’s highest level of decision-making 
authority (the District’s Board of Education). Such constraints can only be removed or changed by the 
same form of formal action. 

 
Funds set aside by the Board of Education as committed fund balance requires the approval of a 
resolution by a majority vote of the members of the Board of Education. Such approval must take 
place prior to the District’s fiscal year-end in order for it to be applicable to that fiscal year. It is 
permitted for the specific amount of the commitment to be determined after the fiscal year-end if any 
additional information is required in order to determine the exact amount. The Board of Education has 
the authority to remove or change the commitment of funds with a resolution. 

 
 Assigned fund balance: The assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts that are 

constrained by the government’s intent to be used for specific purposes but meet neither the 
restricted nor committed forms of constraint. Assigned funds cannot cause a deficit in unassigned 
fund balance. For the purposes of assigned fund balance, the District has given authority to its Chief 
Financial Officer as the Board approved Encumbrance Clerk to assign funds for specific purposes. 

 
 Unassigned fund balance: The unassigned fund balance classification is the residual classification 

for the General Fund only. It is also where negative residual amounts for all other governmental funds 
must be reported. Unassigned fund balance essentially consists of excess funds that have not been 
classified in the other four fund balance categories mentioned above. 

 
It is the District’s policy to use restricted fund balance prior to the use of unrestricted fund balance when 
an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted fund balance are available. 
The District’s policy for the use of unrestricted fund balance amounts requires that committed amounts 
would be used first, followed by assigned and then unassigned amounts when expenditures are incurred 
for purposes for which amounts in any of those unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used.

State revenues: Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state 
aid formula under the provision of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The Oklahoma State 
Department of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on 
information accumulated from the districts. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money due to changes in state revenue 
actual collections versus appropriated funds.  
 
The District receives revenues from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. 
Oklahoma State Department of Education rules require that revenues earmarked for these programs are 
expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require that money not expended as 
of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following fiscal year to be expended for the same 
categorical programs. Approximately $441 of state categorical revenue was carried forward to fiscal year 
2019. The Oklahoma State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program 
revenue be accounted for in the general fund.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
Property tax revenue: The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes. Property tax is levied 
each October 1st on the assessed valuation of real and personal property within the District as of the 
preceding January 1st, the lien date. The county assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies 
from the Oklahoma County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the 
County Treasurer. All taxes levied upon an ad valorem basis for each fiscal year shall become due and 
payable on the first day of November. 
 
The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1, and the second half is due prior to April 1. If the first half of 
tax payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half taxes 
are delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. Mortgage servicers are prohibited 
from paying in halves; ad valorem from mortgage servicers is due prior to January 1. The Oklahoma 
County Treasurer conducts an annual Resale the second Monday in June. Property with taxes delinquent 
of four years are sold at Resale. A successful bidder at Resale will be issued a deed to the property by 
the next business day. Any property not sold at Resale will be deeded to Oklahoma County. 
 
Property tax receivables are recorded on the lien date, although the related revenue is reported as a 
deferred inflow of resources and will not be recognized as revenue until the year for which it is budgeted. 
 
Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the District to make estimates and 
assumptions in preparing financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported 
amounts of assets, deferred inflows and outflows, liabilities, and net position; the disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities; and the reported revenues and expenditures. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. 
 
New accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal year 2018: The District adopted the following new 
accounting pronouncements during the year ended June 30, 2018:  
 
GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions (OPEB) was issued in June 2015 and was effective for the District in the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2018. The Statement requires governments to report a liability on the face of the financial 
statements for the OPEB they provide and outlines the reporting requirements by governments for 
defined benefit OPEB plans administered through a trust, cost-sharing OPEB plan administered through a 
trust, and OPEB not provided through a trust. The Statement also requires governments to present more 
extensive note disclosures and required supplementary information about their OPEB liabilities. See Note 
9 for additional information regarding the District’s OPEB.

Note 1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
New accounting pronouncement issued not yet adopted: The GASB has issued several new 
accounting pronouncements that will be effective in future years. Only the following issued 
pronouncements are believed to impact the District: 
 
GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations, issued December 2016, will be effective 
for the District, beginning with its fiscal year ending June 30, 2019.  Under Statement No. 83, a 
government that has legal obligations to perform future asset retirement activities related to its tangible 
capital assets is required to recognize a liability and a corresponding deferred outflow of resources. The 
statement identifies the circumstances that trigger the recognition of these transactions.  The statement 
also requires the measurement of an asset retirement obligation to be based on the best estimate of the 
current value of outlays expected to be incurred while the deferred outflow of resources associated with 
the asset retirement obligation will be measured at the amount of the corresponding liability upon initial 
measurement and generally recognized as an expense during the reporting periods that the asset 
provides service. The statement requires disclosures including a general description of the asset 
retirement obligation and associated tangible capital assets; the source of the obligation to retire the 
assets; the methods and assumptions used to measure the liability; and other relevant information. 
 
GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities, issued February 2017, will be effective for the District 
beginning with its fiscal year ending June 30, 2020.  The objective of Statement No. 84 is to improve 
guidance regarding the identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
and how those activities should be reported. This statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary 
activities of all state and local governments. The focus of the criteria generally is on (1) whether a 
government is controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and (2) the beneficiaries with whom a 
fiduciary relationship exists. Separate criteria are included to identify fiduciary component units and 
postemployment benefit arrangements that are fiduciary activities. 
 
GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, issued June 2017, will be effective for the District beginning with its 
fiscal year ending June 30, 2021, with earlier adoption encouraged. Statement No. 87 establishes a 
single approach to accounting for and reporting leases by state and local governments. Under this 
statement, a government entity that is a lessee must recognize (1) a lease liability and (2) an intangible 
asset representing the lessee’s right to use the leased asset. In addition, the District must report the 
(1) amortization expense for using the lease asset over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful 
life of the underlying asset, (2) interest expense on the lease liability and (3) note disclosures about the 
lease. The statement provides exceptions from the single-approach for short-term leases, financial 
purchases, leases of assets that are investments, and certain regulated leases. This statement also 
addresses accounting for lease terminations and modifications, sale-leaseback transactions, non-lease 
components embedded in lease contracts (such as service agreements), and leases with related parties. 
 
The District is currently evaluating the impact that these new standards may have on its financial 
statements.

Note 2. Deposits and Investments 
Custodial credit risk – deposits: Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of failure of the 
counterparty, the District may not be able to recover the value of its deposits. Deposits are exposed to 
custodial credit risk if they are uninsured and uncollateralized. The District’s policy requires all deposits in 
excess of amounts covered by federal deposit insurance be fully collateralized by the entity holding the 
deposits. As of June 30, 2018, all of the Districts deposits were either covered by federal deposit 
insurance or were collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution’s trust department 
in the District’s name. In addition, the District’s investments in certificates of deposit, totaling $31 million, 
are held by its agent in the District’s name and fully insured or collateralized and are therefore not 
exposed to custodial credit risk. 
 
Custodial credit risk – investments: For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that the District 
will not be able to recover the value of its investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of 
an outside party. Investment securities are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured, are not 
registered in the name of the District, and are held by a counterparty or the counterparty’s trust 
department but not in the name of the District. The District’s investments in sweep accounts, totaling 
$144.7 million, are not deposits or obligations of any bank, are not guaranteed by any bank and are not 
insured or guaranteed by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other government agency, and 
are therefore exposed to custodial credit risk. The District mitigates this risk by investing in sweep 
accounts that invest primarily in short-term U.S. Treasury and government securities, in accordance with 
State Statutes.  
 
Concentration of credit risk: The District’s investment policy requires that, except for direct obligations 
of the U.S. government, its agencies, or instrumentalities or certificates of deposit secured by diversified 
pledges of collateral, the District’s investment portfolio will be diversified to avoid incurring undue 
concentration in securities of one type. As of June 30, 2018, the District’s investment portfolio was 
invested in sweep accounts (83 percent) and certificates of deposit (17 percent). 
 
Interest rate risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair 
value of an investment. The District does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a 
means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. The District’s 
investment policy does limit investment maturities for purposes of liquidity management. District sources 
of funding limit investments to be very short-term in nature. Funds are strategically placed for meeting 
cash flow needs for all areas of cash management. As of June 30, 2018, the District’s investments were 
in sweep accounts that mature daily or six and twelve month certificates of deposit.

Note 5. Compensated Absences 
Upon retirement or resignation in good standing, the District pays eligible employees for unused sick 
leave at a set daily rate as determined by classification and/or length of service. The length of service 
required to receive the sick leave payout is determined by the employee’s applicable collective bargaining 
agreement for the District’s school administrators, support, and certified staff and District policy for all 
other pro-tech/administrative staff.  The number of allowed sick leave carry forward days for support, 
professional/technical and principals is 200 days.  Certified employees (teachers) may carryover 201 
days. 
 
Unused vacation leave is calculated at hourly rates. The maximum carryover of vacation leave is two 
times the allowable annual accrued amount. 
 
Personal days not used by employees by June 30 become sick days subject to the accrual calculation 
and limitations above. As of June 30, 2018, the District had an outstanding liability for unused sick, 
vacation, and personal leave totaling approximately $4.94 million and a related liability for payroll taxes 
associated with the unused sick, vacation, and personal leave totaling approximately $1.53 million. 
 
This liability is typically liquidated from the fund balance of the General, Building, and School Nutrition 
Funds.

Note 6. Long-Term Liabilities (Continued) 
Interest expense on general obligation bonds during the year ended June 30, 2018 totaling approximately 
$3.63 million is recorded in the debt service fund. 
 
Bonds sold at discounts decrease the carrying value of the bond, and bonds sold at a premium increase 
the carrying value. The discount or premium is then amortized, using the effective interest method, as an 
increase or decrease, respectively, to the coupon interest payment in reporting interest expense. 
Amortization expense on bond premiums for the year ended June 30, 2018 is approximately $834 
thousand. The net amount of unamortized premium at June 30, 2018 is approximately $4.6 million. 
 
Debt refunding: 
On June 9, 2017, OKCPS issued $30,985 General Obligation Refunding Bonds, Series 2017B (the 
“2017B Refunding Bonds”) for the purpose of refunding the outstanding balance of the District’s General 
Obligation Bonds of 2004, 2005, and 2009 (the “Old Debt”). The 2017B Refunding Bonds were issued in 
accordance with the provisions of the Oklahoma Constitution and laws of the State of Oklahoma 
supplementary and amendatory thereto. The 2017B Refunding Bonds constitute direct and general 
obligations of the District, payable from ad valorem taxes levied against all taxable property. 
 
The net proceeds of the 2017B Refunding Bonds, totaling $33,981 (after premium of $3,378 and payment 
of issuance cost of $382) plus an additional $8,709 of debt service fund monies, were used to refund the 
old debt and pay interest due at the time of the refunding of $839. Funds of $9,891 were used to 
immediately pay off the General Obligation Bonds of 2004 and 2005 (current refundings) and pay interest 
due. The remaining $32,799 was used to purchase U.S. government securities. Those securities were 
deposited in an irrevocable trust with an escrow agent to provide for all future debt service payments on 
the General Obligation Bonds of 2009 (advance refunding). These obligations are considered to be 
defeased and the liability for those bonds have been removed from the district-wide statement of net 
position. At June 30, 2018, the remaining balance of the defeased debt held in escrow was $26,985. 
 
These refundings resulted in a difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying amount of 
the Old Debt of $1,181. This difference, reported in the district-wide statements of net position as deferred 
outflow of resources, is being charged to operations through 2025 using the effective interest method. 
The remaining balance at June 30, 2018 is $991. 
 
Capital leases: The District records lease agreements that qualify as capital leases for accounting 
purposes at the present value of their future minimum lease payments at their inception date. The present 
value is calculated based on the lessor’s implicit interest rate.  
 
In November 2014, the District entered into a sixty month equipment lease purchase agreement with Dell 
totaling approximately $833. At the end of the lease, the District can exercise the option to purchase the 
equipment for one dollar. Principal is due in annual installments of approximately $179.  
 
In December 2015, the District entered into a sixty month equipment lease purchase agreement with Dell 
totaling approximately $988. At the end of the lease, the District can exercise the option to purchase the 
equipment for one dollar. Principal is due in annual installments of approximately $211.  
 
In December 2016, the District entered into a sixty month equipment lease purchase agreement with Dell 
totaling approximately $259. At the end of the lease, the District can exercise the option to purchase the 
equipment for one dollar. Principal is due in annual installments of approximately $54.

Note 8. Employee Retirement Plans 
The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). 
Additionally, the District provides a defined contribution plan for eligible employees. 
 
Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System  
 
Plan description: The District participates in the OTRS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public 
employee retirement system that is self-administered. OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death 
benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are established and may be amended by 
the legislature of the State of Oklahoma. Title 70 of the Oklahoma State Statutes assigns the authority for 
management and operation of OTRS to the Board of Trustees of OTRS. OTRS issues a publicly available 
annual financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS/. 
 
Benefits provided: OTRS provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final compensation, 
age, and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon disability and to 
survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 defines all retirement benefits. 
The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. 
 
Benefit provisions include: 

 Members who joined OTRS prior to November 1, 2017 become 100 percent vested in retirement 
benefits earned to date after five years of credited Oklahoma service. Members who joined after 
November 1, 2017 will become 100 percent vested after seven years. Members who joined OTRS on 
June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire at maximum benefits when age and years of creditable 
service total 80. Members joining OTRS after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when 
their age and years of creditable service total 90. Members whose age and service do not equal the 
eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as early as age 55, and at age 62 receive unreduced 
benefits based on their years of service. The maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2 percent of final 
compensation for each year of credited service. 

 Final compensation for members who joined OTRS prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as the average 
salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for members joining OTRS 
after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive years of annual 
compensation in which contributions have been made. The final average compensation is limited for 
service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000 (not in thousands), depending 
on the member’s election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits accumulated after 
June 30, 1995 are calculated based on each member’s final average compensation, except for certain 
employees of the State’s two comprehensive universities. Upon the death of a member who has not 
yet retired, the designated beneficiary shall receive the member’s total contributions plus 100 percent 
of interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with interest rates varying based on time of 
service. A surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, in lieu of the aforementioned 
benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled to at the time of death as provided under the 
joint survivor benefit option.

Note 8. Employee Retirement Plans (Continued) 

 Upon the death of a retired member, OTRS will pay $5,000 (not in thousands) to the designated 
beneficiary, in addition to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the member. 

 A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. The disability 
benefit is equal to 2 percent of final average compensation for the applicable years of credited service. 

 Upon separation from OTRS, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based on certain 
restrictions provided in the plan, or by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). 

 Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program up to the 
exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b). 

 
Contributions: The contribution requirements of OTRS are at an established rate determined by 
Oklahoma Statute and are not based on actuarial calculations. Employees who are non-retired members 
of OTRS are required to contribute 7 percent of their annual compensation.  Annual compensation is 
defined as the salary plus fringe benefits (excluding flexible benefit allowance).  For employees who are 
covered by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) Certified Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), 
the District paid 7 percent of the employee’s annual compensation minus the OTRS service credit.  For 
building administrators who are covered by the Oklahoma City Business Administrator (OCBA) CBA and 
Central Office/professional and technical staff, the District paid 100 percent of the 7 percent up to $60,000 
(not in thousands) of annual compensation, then the District paid 90 percent and the employee paid 10 
percent of the 7 percent of annual compensation for the rest of the fiscal year.  For support employees 
who are covered by the Oklahoma City Federation of Classified Employees (OCFCE) CBA, the District 
paid 90 percent of the 7 percent and the employee paid 10 percent of the 7 percent up to $40,000 (not in 
thousands) of annual compensation, then the employee contributed the full 7 percent of annual 
compensation for the rest of the fiscal year.  For all retired OTRS members employed by the District, the 
District paid 16.5 percent (the employee and District/employer portions) of the employee’s annual 
compensation. 
 
The amount paid by the District for employees totaled approximately $10.91 million for the year ended 
June 30, 2018. The District’s contribution rate is 7 percent for the year ended June 30, 2018. In addition, 
the District is required to match the State of Oklahoma’s contribution rate on salaries that are paid with 
grant funds. The District’s contributions to OTRS in 2018 were $17.71 million, equal to the annual 
required contributions. The District’s matching contributions to OTRS in 2018 were $1.7 million. 
 
The State of Oklahoma makes a contribution on behalf of each teacher meeting minimum salary 
requirements (known as the OTRS years of service credit). The credit amount is determined based on 
years of service recognized by the District and ranges from $60.15 actual dollars per year for 0 years of 
service to $1,410.53 actual dollars per year for 25 years or more of service. For the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2018, the State paid approximately $1.63 million on behalf of teachers employed at the District. 
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the District recognized the on-behalf-of 
payments as revenue and expense/expenditure in the district wide and fund financial statements.  
 
The State of Oklahoma is also required to contribute to the System on behalf of the participating 
employers. For 2018, the State of Oklahoma contributed 5 percent of state revenues from sales and use 
taxes and individual income taxes, to the System on behalf of participating employers. The District has 
estimated the amounts contributed to the System by the State of Oklahoma on its behalf based on a 
contribution rate provided to the District. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the total amount contributed 
to the System by the State of Oklahoma on behalf of the District was approximately $14.35 million. In 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, District recognized the on-behalf-of payments 
as revenue and expenditure in the governmental fund financial statements.

Pension liabilities, pension expense, and deferred inflows/outflows of resources related to 
pensions: At June 30, 2018, the District reported a liability of $303.61 million for its proportionate share 
of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017 and the total 
pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
June 30, 2017. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s 
contributions to OTRS relative to total contributions of OTRS for all participating employers for the year 
ended June 30, 2017. Based upon this information, the District’s proportion was 4.58531210 percent. The 
change in proportion from June 30, 2016 was a decrease of 0.29711455 percent. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District recognized pension expense of $31.92 million. At June 30, 
2018, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to 
pensions from the following sources:

on pension plan investments will be recognized in pension expense over five years as of the beginning of 
each measurement period. Other deferred inflows and outflows are being amortized over a closed period 
equal to the average of the expected service lives of all employees as of the beginning of the 
measurement period.

Actuarial assumptions: The total pension liability was determined based on an actuarial valuation 
prepared using the following actuarial assumptions: 
 
 Actuarial Cost Method—Entry Age Normal 

 Inflation—2.50 percent 

 Future Ad Hoc Cost-of-Living Increases—None 

 Salary Increases—Composed of 3.25 percent wage inflation, including 2.50 percent price inflation, 
plus a service-related component ranging from 0.00 percent to 8.00 percent based on years of 
service 

 Investment Return—7.50 percent  

 Retirement Age—Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted by 
the Board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five-year experience study for the period ended 
June 30, 2014 

 Mortality Rates after Retirement—Males: RP-2000 Combined Healthy mortality table for males with 
White Collar Adjustments. Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from 
the table’s base year of 2000. Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, scaled at 
105 percent. Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table’s base 
year of 2012 

 Mortality Rates for Active Members—RP-2000 Employee Mortality tables, with male rates multiplied 
by 60 percent and female rates multiplied by 50 percent 

 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building block 
method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of 
pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges 
are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates 
of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation.

* The Real Estate total expected return is a combination of US Direct Real Estate
(unlevered) and US Value Added Real Estate (unlevered).  

 
Discount rate: The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.5 percent. This single 
discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on pension plan investments of 7.5 percent. 
The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member and 
employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of 
payroll. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the matching 
contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five years of 
actual contributions. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, OTRS’ fiduciary 
net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future benefit 
payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension 
liability. 
 
Sensitivity of the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate: The following table presents 
the net pension liability of the District calculated using the discount rate of 7.5 percent, as well as what the 
District’s net pension liability would be if OTRS calculated the total pension liability using a discount rate 
that is 1-percentage point lower (6.5 percent) or 1-percentage point higher (8.5 percent) than the current 
rate:

Defined Contribution Plan 
Plan description: The District provides a defined contribution plan under section 401(a) of the Internal 
Revenue Code to eligible employees. Eligible employees include administrators, professional/technical 
staff, and building administrators (e.g., principals). Administrators and professional/technical staff must 
complete three years of continuous service, and building administrators must complete two years of 
continuous service in order for the employee to receive an employer contribution at the end of the fiscal 
year.

Note 8. Employee Retirement Plans (Continued) 
Funding policy: Eligible administrators, professional/technical staff members, and building administrators 
receive a contribution of seven hundred dollars per year. Upon termination or retirement, each of these 
employees can receive the money paid for them in either a lump sum or in any other benefit option 
available. This plan is administered by Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC). The District 
contributed $228 to the plan during the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 

Note 9. Other Post-Employment Insurance Benefits 
Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System – OPEB Subsidy 
 
Plan description: The District as the employer, participates in the Supplemental Health Insurance 
Program—a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Oklahoma 
Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). Title 74 O. S. Sec. 1316.3 defines the health insurance benefits. 
The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a 
publicly available financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS. 
 
Benefits provided: OTRS pays a medical insurance supplement to eligible members who elect to 
continue their employer provided health insurance. The supplement payment is between $100 and $105 
per month, provided the member has ten (10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement. 
 
Contributions: Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 
contained in Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do not specify or identify any particular 
contribution source to pay the health insurance subsidy. Based on the contribution requirements of Title 
70 employers and employees contribute a single amount based on a single contribution rate as described 
in Note 8; from this amount OTRS allocates a portion of the contributions to the supplemental health 
insurance program. The cost of the supplemental health insurance program averages 0.15 percent of 
normal cost, as determined by an actuarial valuation. Contributions allocated to the OPEB plan from the 
System were $299. 
 
OPEB liabilities (assets), OPEB expense, and deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows 
of resources related to OPEB: At June 30, 2018, the District reported an asset of $2,048 for its 
proportionate share of the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and 
the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as 
of June 30, 2017. The District’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on the District’s 
contributions received by the OPEB plan relative to the total contributions received by the OPEB plan for 
all participating employers as of June 30, 2017. Based upon this information, the District’s proportion was 
4.5853121 percent.

Discount rate: A single discount rate of 7.50 percent was used to measure the total OPEB liability (asset) 
as of June 30, 2017. This single discount rate was based on solely on the expected rate of return on 
OPEB plan investments of 7.50 percent. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash 
flows, the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to 
finance all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected 
rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to 
determine the total OPEB liability (asset). The projection of cash flows used to determine this single 
discount rate assumed that plan member and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory 
levels and remain a level percentage of payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the 
State’s contribution plus the matching contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member 
payroll based on the past five years of actual contributions. 
 
Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB liability (asset) to changes in the 
discount rate: The following presents the net OPEB liability (asset) of the employer calculated using the 
discount rate of 7.5 percent, as well as what the Plan’s net OPEB liability (asset) would be if it were 
calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower (6.5 percent) or 1-percentage-point

Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB liability (asset) to changes in the 
healthcare cost trend rate: The benefits paid by the OTRS OPEB Plan are not impacted by healthcare 
cost trend rates. As a result, changes in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption will have no impact on 
the net OPEB liability.

Note 10. Commitment and Contingencies 
Encumbrance accounting is utilized to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to 
facilitate effective cash planning and control. Encumbrances represent commitments related to 
unperformed contracts for goods and services. At year end, the amount of encumbrances (less 
encumbrances that lapsed after year end) expected to be honored upon performance by the vendor in the 
next year were as follows: 
 
General Fund 462  $                      
2007 Bond Funds 3,016                        
2016 Bond Funds 3,163                        
Other governmental funds 2,306

The District receives grant funds from various federal and state grantor agencies. Under the terms of the 
grants, periodic audits are required, and certain costs may be questioned as not being allowable 
expenditures under the terms of the grants. Such audits could lead to reimbursements to the grantor 
agencies. The District management believes disallowances, if any, would be immaterial to the 
accompanying financial statements. 
 
The District is a defendant in various lawsuits. The District intends to vigorously defend itself on the 
various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently determinable, and the amounts 
are not readily estimable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on the financial statements and may be settled by the District’s insurance carrier.  
 

Note 11. Charter Schools 
The District is the pass-through agency of state funds for eight charter schools, which are considered to 
be operationally independent of the District. State funding sources are received by the District and 
distributed to the charter schools monthly. In addition, certain payments are made and costs incurred by 
the District to benefit various charter schools through such programs as the School Nutrition Services 
program, alternative education, at risk sites for adequate yearly progress, and certain contractually 
obligated costs for custodial care and supplies. The District charges each charter school an administrative 
fee of 3.00 percent (of state funding sources) for the services it provides. In addition to the eight charter 
schools for which the District is a pass-through agency of state funds, there is one charter school within 
the District that receives state funds directly from the state and does not pay the District an administrative 
fee.  
 

Note 12. Enterprise Schools 
The District has six enterprise schools. An enterprise school is a District school that has established its 
own governing board. This governing board has contracted with the District to allow for more authority to 
make certain independent decisions impacting that school. All employees and operating costs are 
budgeted and processed within the District’s regular financial operations. However, the enterprise school 
can direct their dollars with regard to curriculum and admission standards within the legal laws governing 
public schools as well as within the specifics of their contract.

Note 13. Tax Abatements 
The Oklahoma City Economic Development Trust (Trust) was established by Oklahoma City Council 
resolution on October 9, 2007 to support the City’s economic and community development goals.  The 
City has designated the Trust to manage economic development, including incentives.  The Trust 
provides economic development incentives in the form of development financing or performance based 
incentives that reduce ad valorem increment allocated to the City, and therefore the District.  These 
economic development project plans have been adopted by the Trust pursuant to the Local Development 
Act, Title 60 of the Oklahoma Statutes, Sections 850, et seq.  It is noted that the incentives do not meet 
the criteria of tax abatement defined in the Oklahoma Local Development Act. The City of Oklahoma 
City’s active TIF agreements resulted in a reduction of reported property tax revenues of approximately 
$3,239. The district’s share of that tax revenue abatement is 55.03 percent, for a reduction of $1,782 of 
property tax revenues to the District.  In all cases of the active agreements, the District receives ad 
valorem taxes at the assessed valuation of the property prior to the TIF agreement.  
 
The State of Oklahoma grants a 5 year exemption of Ad Valorem taxes for certain new manufacturing or 
research and development equipment and facilities.  Pursuant to Section 193 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes, the State will reimburse the District for foregone property taxes as a result of this exemption.  
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the amount of foregone tax revenues as a result of this exemption 
were $1,885, all of which was reimbursed by the State during the year ended June 30, 2018 in connection 
with the abated tax revenues.   
 

Note 14. Restatement of Net Position / Fund Balance 
During the year, the District re-evaluated certain fund classifications and determined that the School 
Nutrition Services Fund should be reclassified from an enterprise fund to special revenue funds. As a 
result of this change, net position/fund balance as of July 1, 2017 was restated as follows:

Budget law and practice: The following is the budget development process for all funds appropriated on 
an annual basis (General Fund, Building Fund, School Nutrition Services Fund, and Sinking Fund). For 
each fiscal year of the District, which begins on July 1, a tentative, or preliminary, budget is presented to 
the Board of Education at the first meeting in July, if not earlier. As required by the School District Budget 
Act (adopted June 4, 2001), a public hearing on the proposed budget summary shall be held within five 
days’ notice published in a newspaper of general circulation in the school district. Within the thirty day 
period preceding the beginning of each fiscal year, a budget for the school district shall be approved by 
the Board of Education. The District may amend the budget after June 30 and present it for Board of 
Education approval, as required by law, and filed (the legal appropriation establishing revenue, tax levies, 
and ad valorem valuations) with the county excise board and the State of Oklahoma Auditor and 
Inspector. 
 
The Board of Education must approve revisions to the final budget and ensure it will not exceed the level 
of appropriation for each fund as established by temporary budget or supplemental appropriation, 
according to law. The budget is updated and reported to the superintendent and Board of Education as 
needed.  
 
The following is the budget development process for all funds operated on an overall budget basis (Bond 
Funds, and Casualty Flood Insurance Recovery Fund). Based on available bonding capacity, the 
superintendent and staff prepare a list of projects determined by the needs within the District and with 
available monies. This list, once approved by the Board of Education, becomes the resolution that is then 
presented to the voters in the District. Oklahoma laws allow schools to be indebted to a maximum of 
110 percent of the net assessed valuation of the district. 
 
The following is the budget administration and management process. Each fund has a budget that is 
assigned by cost center. This budget is administered by a designee authorized by the superintendent to 
monitor and control the budget in compliance with Board of Education policies and State law. 
 
Budget expenditures are monitored through the financial management system, which will not allow 
expenditures to exceed the appropriated budget. The District’s superintendent or designee may transfer 
an unexpended and unencumbered appropriation from one account to another within the same fund. 
Purchase orders are submitted to the Board of Education for approval of payment. 
 
There are not approved budgets for the MAPS Sales Tax Fund, Gifts and Endowments Fund, or the 2016 
Bond Funds.  
 
Encumbrances: Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods 
and/or services. Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts, and other 
commitments for the expenditure of resources are recorded to reserve that portion of the applicable 
appropriation, is utilized in the governmental funds. Encumbrances outstanding at year-end are included 
in the “actual” amounts shown as expended during the year for the budgetary presentation but are 
excluded from the fund balances in the governmental fund financial statements, as they do not constitute 
expenditures or liabilities because the commitments will be honored during the subsequent year. 
 
Revenues: Revenues, except for federal revenues, are recorded on a cash basis and include deposits to 
District accounts from the first day through the last day of the fiscal year regardless of when they were 
actually earned. Federal revenues are recognized for any prior year April through June 30 collections 
deferred and for any collections received July 1 through March 31 of the current year. Any federal cash 
collections received April 1 through June 30 are deferred into the subsequent year.

The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (the “Schedule”) includes the federal 
award activity of the District under programs of the federal government for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
All federal awards received directly from federal agencies, as well as federal awards passed through 
other governmental agencies, and expended during the year are included in this Schedule. The 
information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Because the Schedule presents only a selected 
portion of the operations of the District, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position, 
changes in net assets, or cash flows of the District. 
 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Expenditures reported on the Schedule are reported on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Such 
expenditures are recognized following the cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance, wherein 
certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement. Negative amounts 
shown on the Schedule, if any, represent adjustments or credits made in the normal course of business to 
amounts reported as expenditures in prior years. 
 

Note 3. Indirect Cost Rate 
The District has elected not to use the 10 percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform 
Guidance. 
 

Note 4. Noncash Assistance 
The schedule includes federal awards in the form of noncash assistance (commodities) received during 
the year in the amount of $1,706,600 related to USDA Commodities grants (CFDA Number 10.555)

Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings 
For The Year Ended June 30, 2018 

 
 
Identifying Number: 2017-001 
 
Finding: Auditing procedures over the District’s accounts payable accounts identified a $1.0 million 
overstatement of accounts payable. The District performed an additional analysis and identified $3.6 
million of additional overstatements of accounts payable. Thus, the District had recognized assets 
and liabilities in the government‐wide financial statements, and expenditures and liabilities in the 
fund‐level financial statements for assets, primarily school buses, that had been ordered but the 
assets had not yet been received as of June 30, 2017. The assets were received in July 2017. 
 
Corrective Actions Taken: The District i) reviewed its existing year-end closing processes for accrual, 
modified accrual, and budgetary bases of accounting and ii) revised and enhanced procedures, 
documentation, and monitoring tools to ensure that conversion entries are proper and complete. 

 All purchases possible were completed by year end. 
 Accrual verification included additional i) receipt documentation (e.g. statement of work, proof 

of deliveries, etc.) for evaluation and as support and ii) review of all significant subsequent 
activity. 

 All asset purchases not received and invoiced by year end were evaluated and adjusted for 
accurate recording as necessary. 

 
Status: Fully corrected.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters 

Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed  
in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards 

 
 

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Oklahoma County School District No. I-89 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Oklahoma County School 
District No. I-89 (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements, and have issued 
our report thereon dated February 8, 2019. Our report on our audit of the District’s basic financial 
statements contains an emphasis of matter paragraph describing the implementation of GASB Statement 
No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, and a 
restatement due to the reclassification of the School Nutrition Services from Proprietary Funds/Business-
Type Activities to Governmental Funds/Governmental Activities. 
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of 
the District’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe 
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.  
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
 
 



 

76 

Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The 
results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be 
reported under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program and 
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Required by the Uniform Guidance  
 
 

Independent Auditor’s Report  
 
 

To the Board of Education 
Oklahoma County School District No. I-89 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited the Oklahoma County School District No. I-89’s (the District) compliance with the types 
of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and 
material effect on each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions and grants of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Office Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance 
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect 
on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the 
District’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, the District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
 
 



 

78 

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the District’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each of the major federal programs to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each of the major federal programs and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
