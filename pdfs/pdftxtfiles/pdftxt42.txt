I NDEPEN DENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

The Honorable Board of Education
Cleveland School District #l-6
Pawnee County, Oklahoma

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory
basis of the Cleveland School District #l-6, Pawnee County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June
30, 2018, as listed in the table of contents.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State
Department of Education as described in Note 1, to meet the requirements of the State of Oklahoma, this
includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of
the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards appllcable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Sfandards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I pian and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to traud or
error. ln making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estirnates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my
audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse opinion on u.s. Generally Accepted Accounting principles
As described in Note I to the financial statement, to meet the finañcial reporting requirements of the
pklahoma State Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by Cleveland School
District #l-6, Pawnee County, Oklahoma on the basis of the financial reporting regulåtions prescribed or
permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basiõ ofãccounting other than
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of America.

PAGE 4



I ndependent Auditor's Report
Cleveland School District #l-6
Page 2

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting
described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
although not reasonably determinable, are presumecl to be material.

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
ln my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles paragraphs, the financial statements referred to above do
not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended.

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is
a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State
Department of Education noted above. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset
account group is not known.

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting
ln my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" the combined financial statements referred to in the first paragraph
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances arising from regulatory
basis transactions of each fund type and account group of the Cleveland School District #l-6, Pawnee
County, Oklahoma, as of June 30,2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and
encumbered forthe yearthen ended, on the regulatory basisof accounting described in Note 1.

Other Matters

Other lnformation

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial
statements-regulatory basis within the combined financial statements. The combining statements-
regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under other supplementary
information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined
financial statements-regulatory basis of the District. Also, the accompanying schedule of expenditures of
federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regutation
(CFR) Parf 200, Uniform Administrative Requiremenfs, Cosf Principats, and Audit Requirements for
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the financial statements.

The combining statements-regulatory basis, and the other supplementary information, including the
schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived from
and relate directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial
statements-regulatory basis. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the combined financial
statements-regulatory basis and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial
statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. ln my opinion, the combining
statements-regulatory basis, and the other supplementary lnformation, including the schedule of
expenditures of federal awards, are fairly stated in all material respects in retation to the combined
financial statements-regulatory basis taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in
Note '1.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards

ln accordance with Government Auditing Sfandards, I have also issued my report dated February 4,2019
on my consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters.
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting
and compliance.

NOTES TO COMBINED F INANCIAL STATEMENTS

1 Sionificant ntino Policies

The financial statements of the Cleveland School District #l-6 have been prepared in conformity with an
other comprehensive basis of accounting required by Oklahoma Statutes. The more significant of the
District's accounting policies are described below.

A. Reportinq Entitv

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Titte 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the
public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education
and is financially dependent on State of Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public
school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

ln evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered all
potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was
made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
The basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity
is the governing body's oversight responsibility, especially financial interdependency. A second criterion
used in evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. A third criterion used to
evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of
special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight
responsibifities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units
included in the District's reporting entity.

B. Fund Accounting

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its
operations. Fund accountlng is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial
management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities.

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account group, on the
other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets and
liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable available
financial resources.

Funds are classified into two categories; governmental and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided
into separate "fund types".

Governmen I Fund Tvoes

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, including the
collection and disbursement of ear-marked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or
construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long{erm debt
(debt service funds).

General Fund - The General Fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required
to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local property taxes and
state funding under the Foundation and lncentive Aid Program. Expenditures include all costs associated
with the daily operations of the schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance,
school construction and debt service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes
federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs which includes the Child
Nutrition Program.

Special Revenue Funds - The Special Revenue Funds are the District's Building Fund and Child Nutrition
Fund. The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of
erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment. The Child
Nutrition Fund derives monies from the sale of foods and federal and state program reimbursements.
Expenditures include costs associated with the daily operations of the District's nutrition program.

Debt Service Fund - The Debt Service Fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account for the
accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal, interest and
related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service
and interest earnings from temporary investments.

Capital Proiect Funds - The Capital Project Funds are the District's Bond Funds and are used to account
for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing, and
equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipmeni.

governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms
of a formal trust agreement, either a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund is used. The
terms "nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to whether or not the District is under an obligation to
maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds
on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations.

Agency Fund - The Agency Fund is the school Activity Fund which is used to account for monies
collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The
administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing, and accounting
for these activity funds. The school Activity Funds can include money which is received from the sale of
foods through a school Lunch Fund.

Memorandum O - Total Column

The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate
that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial
position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnter-fund eliminations have not been made in the
aggregation of this data.

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma
State Department of Ëducation (OSDE). This format is essentially the generally accepted form of
presentation used by State and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34,
Basic Financial Statements-Manaqement's Discussion and Analvsisjor State and Local Governments.
This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34.

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows:

* Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments
for the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved.* lnvestments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased.

" Capital assets in proprietary funds are recorded when acquired and depreciated
over their useful lives

" Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.
" Long-term debt is recorded when incurred.* Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when

the obligation is incurred.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 4

C. Basis of Accountinq and Presentation (continued)

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become available and
measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related
liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned and liabilities are
incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds.

D. Budqets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must be
submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1. lf
the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold an election on the first Tuesday
in February to approve the levy. lf the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes
the legal budget. lf an election is held and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes
the legal budget. If voters reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved
tax rate.

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue Funds, and
Debt Service Fund that includes revenues and expenditures.

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.
Encumbrance accounting--under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are
recorded as expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the District.

The unencumbered balance of current fiscal year appropriations and the unexpended reserve
appropriations of the previous fiscal year are lapsed and become a part of the beginning fund balance for
the succeeding fiscal year.

E. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates.

F. Assets. Líabilities and Fund Equitv

Cash. Cash Eouival nts and lnvestments

All monies which are not invested in Certificate of Deposits or United States Treasury Funds are
maintained in NOW Checking Accounts or Savings Accounts.

lnventories

Ïhe value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the financial statements.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 5

Fixed Assets and Pro , Plant and Eouioment

Property and equipment purchases are recorded as capital outlays in the accompanying statements of
revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances. The District does not maintain complete financial
records of capital assets purchased which would include depreciation schedules; therefore, a General
Fixed Asset Group of Accounts is not presented.

Compensated Absences

The District has elected not to present a liability for compensated absences

Operatinq Leases

The District has elected not to present a liability for operating leases. All operating leases contain a
mutual ratification clause for both parties; therefore, the District does not consider the obligation to be for
a period extending beyond the current fiscal year.

Lonq Term Debt

Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due, or when resources have
been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For other long{erm
obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial resources is
reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported
in the general long-term debt account group. Long-term liabilities expected to be financed from
proprietary fund operations are accounted for in those funds.

General Lonq-Term Debt

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by
the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be
fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. General long-term debt of the District consists of
bonds payable. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and future
revenues of the debt service fund.

Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid formula under
the provisions of Article XVlll, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the
allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts.

PAGE 13



CLEVELAND SCHOOL DISTRICT #I-6
PAWNEE COUNTY - OKLAHOMA
JULY 1 ,2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 8

State Revenues (continued)

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education
may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review.
Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the
adjustment is made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State
Board of Education rules require that revenue ear-marked for these programs be expended only for the
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the
fiscal year be carried fon¡¡ard into the following year to be expended for the same categorical program.
The State Deparlment of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted
for in the general fund.

The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which consists of ad valorem taxes on real
and personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax
levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county
treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of
receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of the taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior
to April 1.

lf the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second
half taxes become delinquent on April I of the year following the year of assessment. lf not paid by the
following October '1, the properly is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two
years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. lf at the end of two years the owner
has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.

G. Reve[ue, Expenses and Expenditures

I nter-fund Transactions

Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures, or expenses. Transactions that
constitute reimbursement to a fund for expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly
applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. Any
legally authorized transfers are treated as operating transfers and are included in the results of the
Government Funds. Transfers between the Agency Funds (Activity Funds) and the Governmental Fund
Types (General Fund) are shown as operating transfers into the Governmental Fund Types (General
Fund) only. No transfer is shown out from the Agency Funds as they are custodial in nature (assets
equal liabilities) and do not involve measurement of results of operations.

2. Risk Manaqement

Liabilities Protection PIan

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torls; theft of, damage to and destruction of
assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial
insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials
liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage
in any of the past three fiscal years.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 9

Liabilities Protection Plan (continued)

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a
transfer or pooling risks amount the participants of that pool ln accordance with professional standards,
the District reporls the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk
pool is the Oklahoma School Assurance group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of
providing workers' compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. ln that
capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and cerlain fiscal activities, including
obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing,
and legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG,
the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion
of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated
by projecting losses based on the District's losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in
excess of the Loss Fund so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. lf
the District does not use their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest.

The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public School Unemployment Compensation Program. ln
this program, the District is required to make a deposit based on past experience for potential
unemployment claims. The funds for each District are kept separate. The money contributed by each
District does not earn interest and is fully insured. lf the District has claims in excess of the amount of
their account, they would be liable for the excess.

3. Emplovee Retirement Svstem

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System (the
"System"), which is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement system (PERS). Under
the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating
employees. Participation is required for all teachers and other certified employees and is optional for all
other regular employees of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. A
participant's date of membership is the date the first contribution is made to the System. The System is
administered by a board of trustees which acts as a fiduciary for investing the funds and governing the
administration of the System. The District has no responsibility or authority for the operation and
administration of the System nor has it any liability, except for the current contribution requirements.

A participant with 5 years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement allowance at the age of
sixty-two or with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five. The normal retirement allowance paid
monthly for life and then to beneficiaries, if certain options are exercised, equals two percent of the
average of the highest three earning years of contributory service multiplied by the number of years of
credited service. A participant leaving employment before attaining retirement age, but completing ten
years of service, may elect to vest his accumulated contributions and defer receipt of a retirement annuity
until a later date. When a participant dies in active service and has completed ten years of credited
service, the beneficiary is entitled to a death benefit of $18,000.00, and the surviving spouse may, in lieu
of the death benefit, elect to receive, subject to the surviving spousal options, the participant's retirement
benefits accrued at the time of death.

The contribution rates for the District and its employees, which are not actuarially determined, are
established by statute and applied to the employee's earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits. The
District is required by statute to contribute 9.50% of applicable compensation for the year ended June 30,
2018. An additional 7.80% of compensation is required for federal grants. The District is allowed by the
Oklahoma Teacher's Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating
members. The required contribution for participating member is 7% up to a maximum compensation
level.

The total contributions for employees of Cleveland School District #l-6 covered by the System for the year
2018,2017 and 2016 were $1 ,081,914.77, $1,046,204.91 and $1,086,412.67, respectively.

ïhe pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension
benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension benefits that will
be paid in the future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the
effect of projected salary increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school
districts.

The Oklahoma Teacher Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes
financial statements and required supplementary information for the System. The System issues and
independent financial report, financial statements, and required supplementary information that may be
obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK
73152 or by calling 405-521-2387.

4. Continqencies

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor
agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the
applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be
determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.

5. Subsequent Events

Management has evaluated subsequent events through February 4,2019, whích is the date the financial
statements were available to be issued and has determined that no additional information needs to be
added to the financial statement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

The Honorable Board of Education
Cleveland School District #l-6
Pawnee County, Oklahoma

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by
the Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial
statements, regulatory basis, of Cleveland School District #l-6, Pawnee County, Oklahoma, as tisted in
the Table of Contents, as of and forthe yearended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial
statements, which collectively comprise the District's combined financial statements, and have issued my
report thereon dated February 4,2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the
financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.
However, my report was qualified for the omission of general fixed asset account groups with respect to
the presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the
Oklahoma State Board of Education.

lnternal Gontrol Over Financial Reporting
ln planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, lconsídered the District's internalcontrol
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing my opinion on the financial statements, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, I do
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility ihat a material misstatement
of the District's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by ihose charged wiih governance.

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in ihe first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses
may exist that have not been identified.

INTERNAL CONTROL/COMPLIANCE REPORT
Cleveland School District #l-6
Page Two

Compliance and Other Matters
As parl of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of
material misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on
the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with
those provisions was not an objective of my audit and, accordingly, I do not express such an opinion.

reported under Goye rnment Auditing Sfandards.

Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control and compliance. Accordingly,
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

Honorable Board of Education
Cleveland School District #l-6
Pawnee County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program
I have audited Cleveland School District #l-6, Pawnee County, Oklahoma compliance with the types of
compliance requirements of lifle 2 U.S. Code of Federat Regutations Part 200, tJniform Administrative
Requiremenfs, Cosf Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) that
could have a direct and material effect on each of the District's major federal programs for the year ended
June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results
section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

Management's Responsibility
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and
grants applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs
based on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States; and Tiile 2 U.S. Code of Federat Regutations paft 200, uniform
Administrative Requiremenfs, Cosf Principats, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform
Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those
requirements and performing such other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstances.

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program
ln my opinion, Cleveland School District #l-6 complied, in alf material respects, with the types of
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on lnternal Gontrol over Comptiance
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. ln planning and performing my
audit of compliance, I considered the District's internal control over compliance with the type! oi
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in

Cleveland School District #l-6

accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged
with governance.

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that I consider to be material weaknesses. However,
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solety to describe the scope of our
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
