INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
 
August 14, 2018 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Cushing School District Number I-67 
Cushing, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying basic financial statements—regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major 
fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Cushing School District Number I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma 
(District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018 and the related notes to the financial statements,  as listed in the table of 
contents.   
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet financial reporting requirements of the State of 
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements in the circumstances.  Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance 
of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.   Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 
 
Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by the Cushing School District Number I-67, on the basis of the 
financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education.  The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of 
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not 
reasonably determined, are presumed to be material.

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles” paragraph, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the 
governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Cushing School District Number 
I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for 
the year then ended.  
 
Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
 
In our opinion, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the 
respective financial position—regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the Cushing School District Number I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the 
respective changes in financial position—regulatory basis for the year then ended on the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1. 
 
Other Matters  
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s 
basic financial statements.  The combining statements—regulatory basis, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and 
are not a required part of the basic financial statements.  The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic 
financial statements. Management’s discussion and analysis and budgetary comparison information and notes on pages 3–7 
and 30–35, are presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, and 
are also not a required part of the basic financial statements.     
 
The combining statements—regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements 
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  In our opinion, the combining statements—regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are 
fairly stated in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole arising from regulatory basis 
transactions. 
 
Management’s discussion and analysis and budgetary comparison information and notes on pages 3–7 and 30–35, which are 
the responsibility of management, has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial 
statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated August 14, 2018 on our 
consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions 
of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an 
opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 

Unaudited 
 
As management of the Cushing School District Number I-67 (the “District”), we offer readers of the District’s financial 
statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 2018.  The intent of this discussion and analysis is to look at the District’s financial performance as a whole; 
readers should also review the basic financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements to enhance 
their understanding of the District’s financial performance. 
 
Financial Highlights 
 

The total net position of the District increased $4,260,171 or (11.72%) over the fiscal year. 
 

General revenues accounted for $19,835,188 or 94.2% of total governmental activities revenue.  Program specific 
revenues accounted for $1,218,678 or 5.8% of total governmental activities revenue. 

 
Governmental activities capital assets increased by a net of $1,352,206, primarily due to vo-ag classroom 
improvements, parking lot improvements, softball complex improvements and depreciation. 

 
The District had $15,786,140 in expenses related to governmental activities; $1,218,678 of these expenses was 
offset by program specific charges for services, grants or contributions.  The remaining expenses of the 
governmental activities were offset by property tax levies, state and county sources, and other miscellaneous 
sources. 

 
Overview of the Financial Statements 
 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial statements. The 
District’s basic financial statements are comprised of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) 
fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains other supplementary 
information. 
 
Government-wide financial statements – The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide 
readers with a broad overview of the District’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business.   
 
The Statement of Net position presents information on all of the District’s assets and liabilities, with the difference 
between the two reported as net position.  Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful 
indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the District’s net position changed during the most 
recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change 
occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.  Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this 
statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected property taxes). 
 
The government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes 
and intergovernmental revenues from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their 
costs through user fees and charges.  The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 8–9 of this 
report.

Fund financial statements – A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources 
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.  The District, like other state and local governments, 
uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.  All of the funds 
of the District can be divided into two categories – governmental funds and fiduciary funds. 
 
Governmental Funds – Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  However, unlike the government-wide financial 
statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on current sources and uses of spendable resources, as 
well as on balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year.  Such information may be useful in 
evaluating a government’s near-term financing requirements. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is 
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  By doing so, readers may better understand the 
long-term effect of the government’s near-term financing decision.  Both the governmental funds balance sheet and 
the governmental fund statements of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation 
to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
The District maintains six individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in the Governmental 
Fund Balance Sheet and in the Governmental Fund Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund 
Balances for the General, Building, Sinking and Building Bond funds, all of which are considered to be major funds.  
Data from the other three funds are combined into a single, aggregated presentation.  Individual fund data for each of 
these non-major governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this report. 
 
The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General, Special Revenue (Building, CO-OP and Child 
Nutrition Funds) and Debt Service Funds.  Budgetary comparison schedules have been provided for the major funds 
to demonstrate compliance with the budget and are presented as required supplemental information. 
 
The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 10–13 of this report. 
 
Fiduciary Funds – Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the 
District.  Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of these 
funds are not available to support the District’s own programs.   
 
The District uses an agency fund to account for resources held for student activities and groups.  The basic fiduciary 
fund financial statement can be found on pages 14-15 of this report. 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements – The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full 
understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements.  The notes to the financial 
statements can be found on page 16–29 of this report.   
 
Other Information  
 
In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents certain information 
required by the Oklahoma State Department of Education concerning the District’s budgetary comparisons and notes.  
Required supplementary information can be found on pages 30–35 of this report. 
 
The combining statements referred to earlier in connection with non-major governmental funds are presented on 
pages 36-37 of this report. 
 
Governmental-wide Financial Analysis 
 
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position.  In the 
case of the District, assets (excluding accumulated depreciation) exceed liabilities by $40,602,767 as of June 30, 
2018.

The largest portion of the District’s net position (71.8%) reflects its investments in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings 
and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles), less any debt used to acquire those assets that is 
still outstanding.  The District uses these capital assets to provide service to students; consequently these assets are 
not available for future spending.  Although the District’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, 
it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital 
assets cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.

Total net position $ 40,602,767      $ 36,342,596      

Governmental Activities

 
 
An additional portion of the District’s net position (23.8%) represents resources that are subject to external restriction 
on how they may be used.  The remaining balance of unrestricted net position $1,758,399 may be used to meet the 
government’s ongoing obligation to citizens and creditors. 
 
As of June 30, 2018, the District is able to report positive balances in all three categories of net position for the 
government as a whole. 
 
Analysis of the District’s Operations – The following table provides a summary of the District’s operations for the 
year ended June 30, 2018 with comparative totals for the year ended June 30, 2017.  Governmental activities 
increased the District’s total net position by $4,260,171.

Governmental Activities

 
Financial Analysis of the Governments Funds 
 
Governmental funds – The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, 
outflows, and balances of spendable resources.  Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing 
requirements.  In particular, unreserved fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources 
available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
At the end of the current fiscal year, the District’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of 
$40,602,767.  Approximately 76% of the total amount ($30,920,418) constitutes unreserved fund balance.  The 
remainder of the fund balance is reserved to indicate that is not available for new spending because it has already 
been committed 1) to pay for debt service ($342,294), 2) to pay for OTAC ($83,035), 3) to pay for Building 
($1,689,251), 4) to pay for child nutrition ($177,719) and 5) to pay for capital projects ($7,390,050). 
 
Capital Assets 
 
The District’s investment in capital assets for its governmental activities as of June 30, 2018, amounts to $88,300,624 
(excluding accumulated depreciation).  This investment in capital assets includes land, building and improvements, 
furniture, fixtures and equipment, and vehicles. 
 
Major capital asset events during the current fiscal year included the following: 
 

The vo-ag building, parking lot and softball complex.

Additional information on the District’s capital assets can be found in note 2 on page 25 of this report. 
 
Debt Administration 
 
At the end of the current fiscal year, the District had a total of general obligation bonds payable of $8,470,000, which 
are backed by the future revenues of the Debt Service Fund and a lease payable of $19,670,000, which is backed by 
future revenues from general obligation bond issues.

Total $ 28,140,000      $ 28,140,000      

Governmental Activities

 
Additional information on the District’s long-term debt can be found in footnote 2 on pages 25–26 of this report. 
 
Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates 
 
In the 2018-19 Budget, General fund revenues are budgeted to increase from the 2017-18 Budget.  General property 
taxes as certified assessed valuations have increased over this year.  The state sources of revenue make up 20% of 
General fund revenues.  This revenue source is the most volatile and subject to decline if the State of Oklahoma is 
unable to supplement its income.   
 
As a result of the potential impact in revenue, the District has made a concerted effort to limit appropriations to only 
those items truly necessary.

CHANGES IN FUND BALANCE TO THE GOVERNMENT-WIDE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES AND CHANGES

The accompanying notes are an integral part of the basic financial statements.
13

Net Change in Fund Balances - Total Governmental Funds $ 2,907,964      

Amounts reported in governmental activities in the statement of activities are different because:

Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures.  However, in the statement of  
activities the cost of those assets have not been reflected.  This is the amount of capital
outlays during the current period. 2,359,760      

Depreciation expense on capital assets is reported in the Government-Wide Statement of
Activities and Changes in Net Position, but they do not require the use of current financial
resources.  Therefore, depreciation expense is not reported as expenditures in 
Governmental Funds. (1,007,555)    

Bond proceeds are reported as income in governmental funds, the receipt of bond proceeds
increase long-term liabilities in the statement of net assets.  This is the amount of bond
proceeds received during the current period. (7,470,000)    

Repayment of long-term obligations is reported as an expenditure in governmental funds,
the repayment reduces long-term liabilities in the statement of net position.  This is the
amount of repayments during the current period. 7,470,000

 Payne County, Oklahoma

 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 

The basic financial statements of the Cushing School District Number I-67 (the “District”) have been prepared in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) as applied to local 
government units.  The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the accepted standard-setting body for 
establishing governmental accounting and financial reporting principles.  The more significant accounting policies of 
the District are described below. 
 
A. Reporting Entity 

 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and 
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The District is part of the public 
school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is 
financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support.  The general operating authority for the public school system 
is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  

 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education (Board) composed of five elected members.  The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  The Board, constituting an on-going entity, is the 
level of government, which has governance responsibilities over all activities, related to public elementary and 
secondary school education within the jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District.  The Board receives 
funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of these funding 
source entities.  However, the Board is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined in 
Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since Board members 
are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate management, the 
responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. 

 
These financial statements present only the activities of the District.  The Cushing Public School Foundation is not 
included in the reporting entity since the District does not appoint any of the board members or exercise any 
oversight authority over the Foundation.  The Foundation is an independently operated non-profit organization that 
was developed to assist teachers in improving the quality of education and to provide scholarships.  The 
Foundation exists outside the operational boundaries of the school system.  There are no component units 
(entities considered to be financially accountable to the District). 

 
B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting 

 
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is, in substance, the format established 
by GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis for State and 
Local Governments.   
 
As to basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows: 
 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the expenditure of 
monies are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as assets. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the obligation is paid. 
• Capital assets are recorded when acquired and depreciated over their useful lives.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 

B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (Continued) 
 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when they are 
earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental 
fund types; and, when revenues are earned.   
 
The Fund financial statements conform to the regulatory (statutory) basis of accounting, which is another 
comprehensive basis of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles.  The accounting policies 
are prescribed by the Oklahoma Department of Education and conform to the system of accounting authorized by 
the State of Oklahoma. 

 
The District’s basic financial statements consist of government-wide statements, including a statement of net 
position and a statement of activities, and fund financial statements, which provide a more detailed level of 
financial information.  Basis of accounting determines when transactions are recorded in the financial records and 
reported on the financial statements.  Government-wide financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis 
of accounting.   
  
Government-wide Financial Statements – The statement of net position and the statement of activities display 
information about the District as a whole.  These statements include the financial activities of the primary 
government, except fiduciary funds.   
 
The statement of net position presents the financial condition of the District activities at year-end.  The statement 
of activities presents demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given program are offset by 
program revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific program.  Program 
revenues include 1) charges to students or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, 
or privileges provided by a given function and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the 
operational or capital requirements of a particular function.   
 
Taxes, interest and other items not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as general 
revenues. 
 
Fund Financial Statements – During the year, the District segregates transactions related to certain District 
functions or activities in separate funds in order to aid financial management and to demonstrate legal compliance. 
Fund financial statements are designed to present financial information of the District at this more detailed level.  
The focus of governmental and enterprise fund financial statements is on major funds.  Each major fund is 
presented in a separate column.  Non-major funds are aggregated and presented in a single column.  Fiduciary 
funds are reported by type.    
 

 Fund Accounting – The accounts of the District are organized and operated on the basis of funds.  A fund is an 
independent fiscal accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  Fund accounting segregates funds 
according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance with finance-
related legal and contractual provisions.  The minimum number of funds is maintained consistent with legal and 
managerial requirements.  There are two categories of funds: governmental and fiduciary.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 

B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (Continued) 
 

Governmental Funds – are used to account for the District’s general activities including the collection and 
disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets 
(capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds).  Governmental fund types 
use the Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting, which is primarily cash receipts and disbursements with certain 
modifications as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  If the District utilized 
the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the governmental funds would use the modified accrual 
basis of accounting based on the flow of current financial resources measurement focus recognizing revenues 
when susceptible to accrual (i.e., when they become measurable and available, normally considered available if 
collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period).  As a result, Ad valorem taxes on real and personal 
property associated with the current fiscal period and all other revenue items are recorded as revenues when 
collected rather than when "measurable" and "available."  Entitlements, grants and shared revenues are recorded 
at the time of receipt.   Expenditures are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved rather than at the 
time the related liability is incurred.  Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain 
compensated absences and claims and judgments which are recognized when the obligations are expected to be 
liquidated with expendable available financial resources.  Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash 
basis of accounting.  These practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America. 
 
The following are the District’s major governmental funds: 

 
General fund – is the main operating fund of the District.  It accounts for all financial resources of the general 
government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.  This is a budgeted fund, and any fund 
balances are considered as resources available for use.  Major revenue sources include local property taxes 
and federal and state funding.  Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the 
schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction, and debt 
service on bonds and other long-term debt.  The General Fund also accounts for federal and state financed 
programs where restricted monies must be expended for specific programs.  Project accounting is employed 
to maintain integrity for the various sources of these funds. 

  
Capital Projects fund – consists of the District’s Bond Fund and accounts for the proceeds of bond sales used 
exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing 
facilities, acquisition of technical equipment and the acquisition of transportation equipment. 

 
Debt Service fund – consists of the District’s Sinking Fund and accounts for the accumulation of financial 
resources for servicing of general long-term debt (principal, interest and related costs).  This is a budgeted 
fund.  The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service. 
 
Building Fund – is a special revenue fund which consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied 
for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing furniture, 
equipment and computer software to be used on or for school district property, for paying energy and utility 
costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty insurance premiums for school 
facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of security personnel.

B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (Continued) 
 

Other governmental funds of the District that are considered non-major funds include:   
 

Special Revenue funds – account for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific purposes 
(not including expendable trusts or major capital projects). The special revenue funds are composed of the 
District’s Building Fund, Child Nutrition Fund and CO-OP Fund.  These are budgeted funds and any fund 
balances are considered as resources available for use. 
 

Child Nutrition Fund – consists of monies derived from federal and state financial assistance and food 
sales.  This fund is used to account for the operations of the school cafeteria. 

 
CO-OP Fund – is a special revenue fund which is called the Oklahoma Technical Assistance Center.  It 
accounts for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific purposes.  These are 
budgeted funds and any fund balances are considered as resources available for use. 

 
Fiduciary Funds – account for assets held by the District in a trustee capacity or as an agent on behalf of others.   

 
Agency fund – is custodial in nature and do not present results of operations or have a measurement focus. 
Agency funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting.  This fund is the School Activities Fund 
used to account for monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-
sponsored groups.  This is an unbudgeted fund.  The administration is responsible, under the authority of the 
Board, of collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.  These funds have no equity, assets 
are equal to liabilities, and do not include revenues and expenditures for general operation of the District.    

 
C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures 

 
 1. Deposits and Investments  

 
State statutes govern the District’s investment policy.  Permissible investments include direct obligations of the 
United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank 
and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, and trust 
companies.  Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered 
by federal deposit insurance.  Investments are stated at cost.  The School District invests entirely in 
certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, and participates in the Secured Investment Program of 
Oklahoma State School Boards Association, as authorized by Oklahoma Statutes Title 62, Section 348. 

 
2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 
The District’s financial instruments include cash and investments. The District’s estimates of the fair value of 
all financial instruments does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial 
instruments recorded in the accompanying statement of net assets and fund balance sheets. The carrying 
amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these 
instruments.

3. Estimates 

 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. 
Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 
4. Interfund Transactions 

 
Interfund transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute 
reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to 
another fund are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed.  Non-recurring or non-
routine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. 
 

5. Inventories  
 

Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies held for consumption.  The value of 
consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District’s financial statements.  The costs of 
inventories are recorded as expenditures when encumbered and purchased rather than when consumed. 

 
6. Capital Assets  

 
Capital assets, which include land, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and 
vehicles, are reported in the government-wide financial statements.  The District defines capital assets as 
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $2,500 and an estimated useful life in excess of two years.  
Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed.  Donated 
capital assets are recorded at estimated acquisition value at the date of donation.     
 
The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add value of the asset or materially extend assets 
lives are not capitalized.   
 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed.  Interest 
incurred during construction is not capitalized.   
 
All reported capital assets are depreciated except for land.  Improvements are depreciated over the remaining 
useful lives of the related capital assets.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the 
following estimated useful lives:  

 

   

Assets Years
Buildings and improvements 40 - 100
Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment 10 - 100
Vehicles 5 - 40

7. Compensated Absences 
 

The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in accordance with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, 
Article 6-104, which provides for annual sick leave and personal business days.  District policy allows certified 
employees to accumulate such days to a maximum number of days.  None of the benefits are payable upon 
retirement or death.  Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected in the financial statements 
because such statements are prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. This practice differs from 
generally accepted accounting principles.  

 
8. Long-term Obligations 

 
In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and long-term lease obligations are reported as 
liabilities in the applicable statement of net position.    

 
9. Net Position 

 
In the government-wide financial statement, net position represents the difference between assets and 
liabilities. Net investment in capital assets, consists of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, 
reduced by the outstanding balances of any borrowing used for the acquisition, construction, or improvement 
of those assets.  Net position is reported as restricted when limitations on their use change the nature or 
normal understanding of the availability of the asset.  Such constraints are either externally imposed by 
creditors, contributors, grantors, laws or other governments, or are imposed by law through constitutional 
provisions or enabling legislation.   

 
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances.  The hierarchy is 
based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed upon use of resources for specific purposes 
versus availability of appropriation.  An important distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between 
amounts that are considered nonspendable (i.e., fund balance associated with assets that are not in 
spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or 
items that are legally required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund)) and those 
that are spendable (such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or receivables).   
 
Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, assigned or 
unassigned, as appropriate. 
 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors (such as 
debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments; or by law, through 
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 

 
Committed fund balance represents amount that are useable only for specific purposes by formal action 
of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority.  Such amounts are not subject to legal 
enforceability (like restricted amounts), but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government 
removes or changes the limitation by taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment.

C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (Continued) 
 

9. Net position (Continued) 
 

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes but are 
neither restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-
level body or official who the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for 
specific purposes.  Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable amounts (except negative 
balances) that are reported in governmental funds other than the general fund, that are neither restricted 
nor committed, and amounts in the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in 
accordance with the provisions of the standard. 

 
Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund.  It represents the amounts 
that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to 
specific purposes within the general fund.   

 
10. Property Taxes and Other Local Revenues 

 
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 
personal property within the District.  The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from 
the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer.  
Property taxes are levied on November 1 and are due on receipt of the tax bill.  The first half of taxes is due 
prior to January 1.  The second half is due prior to April 1.  If the first payment is not made timely, the entire 
tax becomes due and payable on January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year 
following the assessment.  If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount 
of the taxes due.  The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  If 
at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.  No 
provision has been made for uncollected taxes, as all taxes are deemed collectible.  Other local sources of 
revenues include tuition, fees, rentals, disposals, commissions and reimbursements. 

 
11. Intermediate Revenues 

 
Revenue from intermediate source is the amount of money from funds collected by an intermediate 
administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the district and the state, and distributed to districts in 
amounts that differ in proportion to those which were collected within such systems. 

 
12. State Revenues 

 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs.  State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal 
year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  The State 
Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund.   
 
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by state aid formula under the 
provisions of Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state 
aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts.  After review and verification 
of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal 
period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review.  Normally, such adjustments are treated 
as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (Continued) 
 

13. Federal Revenues 
 

Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form of operating grants or 
entitlements.  An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific purpose, activity or facility.  A grant 
may be received either directly from the federal government or indirectly as a pass through from another 
government, such as the state.  Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant 
to an allocation formula contained in applicable statutes.  The majority of the federal revenues received by the 
District are apportioned to the general fund.  The District maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the 
federal revenues received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

 
14. Non-Monetary Transactions 

 
The District receives commodities from the U. S. Department of Agriculture.  The value of these commodities 
has been included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards and they have been reflected in the 
basic financial statements as revenue and expense.     

 
15. Resource Use Policy 
 

It is in the School’s policy for all funds that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which 
both restricted and unrestricted resources, including fund balances, are available, the School considers 
restricted amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used.  Furthermore, it is the School’s 
policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which committed, assigned, or 
unassigned resources, including fund balances, are available, the School considers committed amounts to be 
spent first, followed by assigned amounts and lastly unassigned amounts.

3. OTHER INFORMATION  
 

A. Risk Management  
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; errors 
and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God.  The District purchases commercial insurance to cover these 
risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials’ liability.  The District had the 
following insurance coverage during the year: commercial property - $350,000,000; general liability - $1,000,000;   
and educators liability $1,000,000.  Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial 
insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 
 
The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or 
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool.  In accordance with GASB No. 10, the School reports the 
required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense.  The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 
Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' compensation coverage 
to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma.  
 
In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including 
obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal 
defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year.  As a member of OSAG the District is 
required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule.  A portion of the fees paid by the 
District goes into a loss fund for the District.  The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based on 
the schools losses for the last five years.  OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the District's 
liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund.  If the District does not use their loss fund in three 
years it is returned to them with no interest. 

 
The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation Program.  In this 
program the District is required to contribute 1.6% of their taxable payroll for unemployment insurance.  The funds 
for each district are kept separate and districts can contribute more than 1.6% of their payroll if they elect to.  The 
money contributed by each District earns interest and is fully insured.  If the District has claims in excess of the 
amount in their account they would be liable for the excess.

3. OTHER INFORMATION (Continued) 
 

B. Contingent Liabilities  
 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, 
principally the federal government. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a 
liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot 
be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 

C. Non-Monetary Transactions 
 

The fair market value as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services of the commodities 
received during the period under audit was $66,353.  

 
D. Employee Retirement System and Plan 

 
Description of Plan 

 
The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, which is a cost 
sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system (PERS), which is administered by 
the Board of Trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (the “System”).  The System provides 
retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and 
beneficiaries.  Title 70 Section 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be amended 
only through legislative action.   

  
The Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial 
statements and required supplementary information for the System.  That report may be obtained by writing to the 
Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma District, OK 73152 or by calling 405-521-
2387. 

 
Basis of Accounting 

 
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of interest 
income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made. Benefits and 
refunds are recognized when paid.  The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the 
present value of pension benefits.  This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension 
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the 
effect of projected salary increases.  There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts.  
The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 

  
Funding Policy 

 
The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions.  The contribution rates for 
the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes.  The rates are not 
actuarially determined.  The rates are applied to the employee’s earnings plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  The 
required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation.  Additionally, OTRS receives “federal 
matching contributions” for positions whose funding comes from federal sources or certain grants.  The District 
and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable compensation.  Contributions received by the System 
from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and 
individual income taxes.  The District contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution 
contributed the remaining 4.5% during this year.  The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement 
System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating members.  The school is required to pay 
16.5% for any compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits.

4. RELATED PARTY 
 

The Cushing Educational Facilities Authority was created by Trust Indenture dated September 13, 2013, under the 
provisions of Title 60, Oklahoma Statutes 2011, Sections 176 to 180.3, inclusive.  The Trust was created generally to 
promote the development of educational, recreational and cultural activities within and near the territorial limits of the 
City and to thereby provide educational, recreational and cultural facilities which will benefit and strengthen culture and 
the economy of the City of Cushing, Oklahoma.  The Authority is exempt from State and Federal Income taxes.  In 
2013, the Authority issued 2013 General Obligation Bonds in the amount of $39,730,000 for the purpose of 
constructing, equipping, repairing and remodeling school buildings, acquiring school furniture, fixtures and equipment 
and acquiring and improving school sites.  Final maturity of those bonds has not been determined at this time.  
Construction of facilities started during the year.  The City of Cushing, as beneficiary, has elected to preserve the legal 
structure of this Authority for a potential future use. The School will be liable to pay these monies back through bond 
issues. 

 
5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
 

Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the audit report, which is the date the financial 
statements were available to be issued and have determined that there is a possibility that the Cushing School Building 
Fund may be required to re-pay Stroud Schools Building Fund for excess property tax revenues received due to 
Lincoln County incorrectly identifying the school districts in the property tax valuations.  No estimated amount of liability 
has been added to the financial statements at this time.

 For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018

BUDGETARY INFORMATION 
 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.  A preliminary budget is submitted to the Board of 
Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1.  Since the voters have permanently 
approved the additional levies, the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget.  An annual Estimate of Needs is then 
approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise Board.  
Supplemental appropriations can be made during the year.  

 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.  Encumbrance 
accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the 
applicable fund - is utilized in all Governmental Funds of the District.  Purchase orders or contracts document 
encumbrances for goods or purchased services.  Under Oklahoma law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at year-
end.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL  

 STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
 
August 14, 2018 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Cushing School District Number I-67 
Cushing, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the accompanying basic financial statements —regulatory basis of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Cushing School District Number I-67, 
Payne County, Oklahoma (District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial 
statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated 
August 14, 2018, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of 
accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board.   
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of District’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of District’s 
internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will 
not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention 
by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was 
not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. 
Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be 
material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our 
audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.  
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on 
compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering the entity’s internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other 
purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 
 PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED 
 BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
August 14, 2018 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Cushing School District Number I-67 
Cushing, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited the Cushing School District Number I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma (District)’s compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District’s major federal 
programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and 
questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with the federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its 
federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs based on 
our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; 
and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).   Those standards 
and Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District’s 
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. 
However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, Cushing School District Number I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material respects, with 
the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
 
Management of Cushing School District Number I-67, Payne County, Oklahoma (the District), is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the District’s internal control 
over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal 
program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s 
internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does 
not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect 
and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis.  A material 
weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant 
deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in 
internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we 
consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal 
control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.  
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
