INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

 
September 12, 2018 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56 
Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements—regulatory basis of the 
Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma (District), as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018 and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.   
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements  
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet financial reporting requirements of the State of 
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements in the circumstances.  Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance 
of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the comptroller General of the United States. Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design 
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 
 
Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by the Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, on the basis of 
the financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education.  The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of 
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not 
reasonably determined, are presumed to be material.

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the Perkins-Tryon School 
District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position, or, 
where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended.  
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
 
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is a departure from the 
regulatory basis of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The amount that should be 
recorded in the general fixed asset account group is not known.   
 
Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the “Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of 
Accounting” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the 
assets, liabilities and fund balance arising from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of Perkins-
Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected 
and expenditures paid and encumbered for the year then ended on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 
 
Other Matters  
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s 
basic financial statements.  The combining statements—regulatory basis, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and 
are not a required part of the basic financial statements.  The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for 
purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic 
financial statements. 
 
The combining statements—regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements 
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  In our opinion, the combining statements—regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are 
fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole arising from regulatory basis 
transactions. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated September 12, 2018 on our 
consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions 
of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an 
opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 

The accompanying financial statements of the Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne 
County, Oklahoma (the “District”) conform to the regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis 
of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting 
authorized by the State of Oklahoma.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present 
financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.  The District’s accounting policies are described in the following notes that are an integral part of the 
District's financial statements.  

 
A. Reporting Entity 

 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and 
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The District is part of the public 
school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is 
financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support.  The general operating authority for the public school system 
is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  

 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education (Board) composed of five elected members.  The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  The Board, constituting an on-going entity, is the 
level of government, which has governance responsibilities over all activities, related to public elementary and 
secondary school education within the jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District.  The District receives 
funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of these funding 
source entities.  However, the District is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined in 
Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since Board members 
are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate management, the 
responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. 

 
These financial statements present only the activities of the District.  There are no component units (entities 
considered to be financially accountable to the District). 

 
B. Measurement Focus 

 
The accounts of the District are organized and operated on the basis of funds and account groups.  A fund is an 
independent fiscal accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  Fund accounting segregates funds 
according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance with finance-
related legal and contractual provisions.  The minimum number of funds is maintained consistent with legal and 
managerial requirements.  The Account Groups are reporting devices to account for certain assets and liabilities of 
the governmental funds not recorded directly in other funds. 

 
The District has the following fund types and account groups:   

 
Governmental funds - are used to account for most of the District’s general activities, including the collection 
and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general 
fixed assets  (capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt  (debt service funds).   Basis 
of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures or expenses are recognized in the accounts and 
reported in the financial statements.  Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, 
regardless of the measurement focus applied.  All governmental type funds are accounted for using the 
Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting.  All revenues from all sources, including property taxes, 
entitlements, grants, and shared revenues are recognized when they are received rather than earned.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 
 B. Measurement Focus (Continued) 
 

Expenditures are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved rather than at the time the related 
liability is incurred.  Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain compensated 
absences and claims and judgments are recognized when the obligations are expected to be liquidated with 
expendable available financial resources.  Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of 
accounting.  These practices differ from generally accepted accounting principles. 

 
Governmental funds include the following fund types: 

 
General fund - is the general operating fund of the District.  It accounts for all financial resources of the 
general government, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.  This is a budgeted fund, 
and any fund balances are considered as resources available for use.  Major revenue sources include 
local property taxes and federal and state funding.  Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily 
operations of the schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school 
construction, and debt service on bonds and other long-term debt.  The General Fund also accounts for 
federal and state financed programs where restricted monies must be expended for specific programs. 
Project accounting is employed to maintain integrity for the various sources of these funds.  The operation 
of the District’s school cafeteria is reported as part of the General fund and consists of monies derived 
from federal and state financial assistance and food sales. 

  
Special Revenue funds - account for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific 
purposes (not including expendable trusts or major capital projects).  The special revenue funds are 
composed of the District’s Building Fund and Child Nutrition Fund.  These are budgeted funds and any 
fund balances are considered as resources available for use. 

 
   Building fund - consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of 

erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing furniture, 
equipment and computer software to be used on or for school district property, for paying energy and 
utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty insurance 
premiums for school facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of security 
personnel. 

 
Child Nutrition Fund - consists of monies derived from federal and state financial assistance and food 
sales. This fund is used to account for the operations of the school cafeteria. 

 
Debt Service fund - consists of the District’s Sinking Fund and accounts for the accumulation of financial 
resources for servicing of general long-term debt (principal, interest and related costs).  This is a budgeted 
fund.  The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service. 

 
Capital Project fund - consists of the District’s Bond Fund and accounts for the proceeds of bond sales 
used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating 
existing facilities, and the acquisition of transportation equipment.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 

B. Measurement Focus (Continued) 
 
Fiduciary funds - account for assets held by the District in a trustee capacity or as an agent on behalf of 
others.  

 
Agency fund - is custodial in nature and does not present results of operations or has a measurement 
focus. Agency funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. These funds are the School 
Activities Fund and Lunch Fund used to account for monies collected principally through fundraising 
efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups.  This is an unbudgeted fund.  The administration is 
responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity 
funds.  These funds have no equity, assets are equal to liabilities, and do not include revenues and 
expenditures for general operation of the District.    

 
Account groups – are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish 
accounting control over long-term debt. 

 
General Long-term Debt Account Group - accounts for the outstanding principal balances of all long-term 
debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund and the amount to be 
provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal.   
 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 
 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education.  This format is essentially the generally accepted form of presentation used by state and 
local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-
Management’s Discussion and Analysis for State and Local Governments with certain modifications.  This format 
differs significantly from that required by GASB 34.   
 
The financial statements are essentially prepared on the basis of cash receipts and disbursements modified as 
required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows: 
 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the 
expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

• Investments are recorded as assets when acquired. 
• School supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as inventory assets. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long-term debt is recorded in the General Long-Term Debt Account Group and not in the basic 

financial statements. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as expenditure when paid and not recorded as a liability. 
• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group and not in the basic 

financial statements.  Fixed assets are not depreciated.  
 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when they are 
earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental 
fund types; and, when revenues are earned.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 

D. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures 
 
 1. Deposits and Investments  

 
State statutes govern the District’s investment policy.  Permissible investments include direct obligations of the 
United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank 
and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, and trust 
companies.  Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered 
by federal deposit insurance.  Investments are stated at cost.  The School District invests entirely in 
certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, and participates in the Secured Investment Program of 
Oklahoma State School Boards Association, as authorized by Oklahoma Statutes Title 62, Section 348. 

 
 2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 
The District’s financial instruments include cash and investments. The District’s estimate of the fair value of all 
financial instruments does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments 
recorded in the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and fund balances. The carrying amount of these 
financial instruments approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

 
  3. Estimates 

 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting requires 

management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. 
Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 
 4. Interfund Transactions 

 
Interfund transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute 
reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to 
another fund are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed.  Non-recurring or non-
routine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. 
 

5. Inventories  
 

Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies held for consumption.  The value of 
consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District’s financial statements.  The costs of 
inventories are recorded as expenditures when encumbered and purchased rather than when consumed. 

 
  6. Fixed Assets  

 
The District has not maintained a record of its general fixed assets, and, accordingly, a General Fixed Asset 
Account Group required by the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Board of 
Education is not included in the financial statements. General fixed assets purchased are recorded as 
expenditures in the various funds at the time of purchase.

  7. Compensated Absences 
 

The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in accordance with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, 
Article 6-104, which provides for annual sick leave and personal business days.  District policy allows certified 
employees to accumulate such days to a maximum number of days.  None of the benefits are payable upon 
retirement or death.  Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected in the financial statements 
because such statements are prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. This practice differs from 
generally accepted accounting principles.  

 
 8. Long-term Obligations 

 
The District reports long-term debt at face value in the general long-term debt account group.  Certain other 
lease obligations not expected to be financed with current available financial resources are also reported in the 
general long-term debt account group.  

 
9. Fund Balance 

 
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances.  The hierarchy is 
based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed upon use of resources for specific purposes 
versus availability of appropriation.  An important distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between 
amounts that are considered non-spendable (i.e., fund balance associated with assets that are not in 
spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or 
items that are legally required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund)) and those 
that are spendable (such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or receivables).   
 
Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, assigned or 
unassigned, as appropriate. 
 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors (such as 
debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments; or by law, through 
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 

 
Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific purposes by formal action 
of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority.  Such amounts are not subject to legal 
enforceability (like restricted amounts), but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government 
removes or changes the limitation by taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment 

 
Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes, but are 
neither restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-
level body or official who the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for 
specific purposes.  Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable amounts (except negative 
balances) that are reported in governmental funds other than the general fund, that are neither restricted 
nor committed, and amounts in the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in 
accordance with the provisions of the standard.

9. Fund Balance (Continued) 

 
Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund.  It represents the amounts 
that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to 
specific purposes within the general fund.   
 

10. Property Taxes and Other Local Revenues 
 
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 
personal property within the District.  The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from 
the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer. 
Property taxes are levied on November 1 and are due on receipt of the tax bill.  The first half of taxes is due 
prior to January 1.  The second half is due prior to April 1.  If the first payment is not made timely, the entire 
tax becomes due and payable on January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year 
following the assessment.  If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount 
of the taxes due.  The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  If 
at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.  No 
provision has been made for uncollected taxes, as all taxes are deemed collectible.  Other local sources of 
revenues include tuition, fees, rentals, disposals, commissions and reimbursements. 

 
11. Intermediate Revenues 

 
Revenue from intermediate source is the amount of money from funds collected by an intermediate 
administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the district and the state, and distributed to districts in 
amounts that differ in proportion to those which were collected within such systems. 

 
 12. State Revenues 
 

Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by state aid formula under the 
provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board of Education administers the 
allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts.  After 
review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may 
adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review.  Normally, such 
adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs.  State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal 
year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  The State 
Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund.

13. Federal Revenues 
 

Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form of operating grants or 
entitlements. An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific purpose, activity or facility.  A grant 
may be received either directly from the federal government or indirectly as a pass through from another 
government, such as the state.  Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant 
to an allocation formula contained in applicable statutes.  The majority of the federal revenues received by the 
District are apportioned to the general fund.  The District maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the 
federal revenues received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

 
14. Non-Monetary Transactions 

 
The District receives commodities from the U. S. Department of Agriculture.  The value of these commodities 
has been included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards; however, they have not been reflected 
in the combined financial statements as either revenue or expense since they are not reported under the 
regulatory basis of accounting.   

 
 15. Memorandum Only - Total Columns  

 
Total columns on the combined financial statements are captioned "memorandum only" because they do not 
represent consolidated financial information and are presented only to facilitate analysis.  The columns do not 
present information that reflects financial position or results of operations in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles.  Inter-fund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data.  

 
16. Comparative Data 

 
Comparative total data for the prior year has been presented in the accompanying financial statements in 
order to provide an understanding of changes in the District's assets, liabilities, fund balances, revenues and 
expenses.  However, complete comparative date (i.e., presentation of prior year totals by fund type in each of 
the statements) has not been presented since their inclusion would make the statements unduly complex and 
difficult to read.  Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year 
classifications. 

 
17. Resource Use Policy 
 

It is in the District’s policy for all funds that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which 
both restricted and unrestricted resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers 
restricted amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used.  Furthermore, it is the District’s 
policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which committed, assigned, or 
unassigned resources, including fund balances, are available, the School considers committed amounts to be 
spent first, followed by assigned amounts and lastly unassigned amounts.

2. STEWARDSHIP, COMPLIANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
 

Budgetary Information  
 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.  A preliminary budget is submitted to the Board of 
Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1.  The electors of the District have voted on 
the question to make the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local support levy permanent; therefore, an annual 
mileage election (normally the first Tuesday in February) is not necessary.  Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal 
Estimate of Needs (Budget) is required for all funds except for trust and agency funds.  Budgets are presented for all 
funds that include the originally approved budgeted appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations 
as adjusted for supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories.  The annual Estimate 
of Needs, when approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County 
Excise Board becomes the legal budget.  Supplemental appropriations, if required, were made during the year and are 
reflected on the budget vs. actual presentations shown as original budget and final budget.  

 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.  Encumbrance 
accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the 
applicable fund - is utilized in all Governmental Funds of the District.  Purchase orders or contracts document 
encumbrances for goods or purchased services.  Under Oklahoma law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at year-
end.

4. OTHER INFORMATION  
 

A. Risk Management  
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; errors 
and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God.  The District purchases commercial insurance to cover these 
risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials’ liability.  The District had the 
following insurance coverage during the year: commercial property - $350,000,000; general liability - $1,000,000;   
and educators liability $1,000,000. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial 
insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

 
The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or 
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool.  In accordance with GASB No. 10, the School reports the 
required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense.  The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 
Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' compensation coverage 
to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma.  In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control 
services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess 
insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the 
plan year.  As a member of OSAG the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established 
payment schedule.  A portion of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District.  The fee for the 
loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based on the school’s losses for the last five years.   
 
OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance 
of the loss fund. If the District does not use their loss fund in three years it is returned to them with no interest. 

 
The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation Program.  In this 
program the District is required to contribute 1.6% of their taxable payroll for unemployment insurance.  The funds 
for each district are kept separate and districts can contribute more than 1.6% of their payroll if they elect to.  The 
money contributed by each District earns interest and is fully insured.  If the District has claims in excess of the 
amount in their account they would be liable for the excess.  

 
B. Contingent Liabilities  

 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, 
principally the federal government. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a 
liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot 
be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.

C. Non-Monetary Transactions 
 

The fair market value as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services of the commodities 
received during the period under audit was $29,208.  

 
D. Employee Retirement System and Plan 

 
Description of Plan 

 
The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, which is a cost 
sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system (PERS), which is administered by 
the Board of Trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (the “System”).  The System provides 
retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and 
beneficiaries.  Title 70 Section 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be amended 
only through legislative action.  The Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System issues a publicly available financial 
report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for the System.  That report may 
be obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 
or by calling 405-521-2387. 
 
Basis of Accounting 

 
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of interest 
income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made.  Benefits 
and refunds are recognized when paid.  The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the 
present value of pension benefits.  This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension 
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the 
effect of projected salary increases.  There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts.  
The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 
 
Funding Policy 

 
The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions.  The contribution rates for 
the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes.  The rates are not 
actuarially determined.  The rates are applied to the employee’s earnings plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  The 
required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation.  Additionally, OTRS receives “federal 
matching contributions” for positions whose funding comes from federal sources or certain grants.  The District 
and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable compensation.  Contributions received by the System 
from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and 
individual income taxes.  The District contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution 
contributed the remaining 4.5% during this year.  The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement 
System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating members.  The school is required to pay 
16.5% for any compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits. 
 
Annual Pension Cost  

 
The District’s total contributions for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $416,196, $423,629 and $432,122, respectively.

            Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Adminstrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL  

 STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
 GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 
 
 
September 12, 2018 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56 
Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements—regulatory basis 
within the combined financial statements of the Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne 
County, Oklahoma (District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial 
statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated 
September 12, 2018, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of 
accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board.  However, our report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account 
group with respect to the presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the 
Oklahoma State Board of Education.  
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of District’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of District’s 
internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will 
not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention 
by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was 
not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. 
Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be 
material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our 
audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.  
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on 
compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering the entity’s internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other 
purpose.

 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 
 PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED 
 BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
 
September 12, 2018 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56 
Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited the Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma (District)’s 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have 
a direct and material effect on each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants applicable 
to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs based on 
our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit requirements of 
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and 
Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those standards and Uniform Guidance require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District’s compliance with those requirements and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. 
However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma, complied, in all 
material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
 
Management of Perkins-Tryon School District Number I-56, Perkins-Tryon, Payne County, Oklahoma (the District), is 
responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the District’s 
internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each 
major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over 
compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the District’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does 
not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect 
and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis.  A material 
weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant 
deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in 
internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we 
consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal 
control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.  
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
