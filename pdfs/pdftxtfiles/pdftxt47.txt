The Honorable Board of Education 
McAlester School District No. 1-80 
Pittsburg County, Oklahoma 

Report on Financial Statements 

Independent Auditor's Report 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements - regulatory 
basis of the McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with financial reporting provisions prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted 
my audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amount and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design· audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evid~nce I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit 
opinion. · 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note 1 (C) to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by the 
McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting 
provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1 (C) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, 
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 

1 



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse Opinion on 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraphs, the financial statements referred to in the first 
paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, the financial position of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma 
as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in financial position for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not include the general fixed asset account 
group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset 
account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on 
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, 
Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for 
the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in the Note 1 (C). 

Other Matters 
Other Information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial 
statements within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-regulatory basis, 
and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under supplementary information, are presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined financial statements of the 
District. The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis 
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and/or the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The combining financial statements-regulatory basis, and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, 
under supplementary information and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting 
records used to prepare the combined financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the 
combined financial statements, and other additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the combined financial 
statements, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America. In my opinion, the supplementary information including the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined 
financial statements taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 (C). 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated January 8, 2019, 
on my consideration of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma's, internal control 
over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not 
to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be 
considered in assessing the results of my audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



MCALESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-80 
PITTSBURG COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying financial statements of the McAlester School District No. 1-80 (the "District
") conform to 

the regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis of accounting pres
cribed by the 

Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting autho
rized by the 

State of Oklahoma. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intende
d to present 

financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally
 accepted in 

the United States of America. The District's accounting policies are described in the followin
g notes that 

are an integral part of the District's financial statements. 

A Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and, 

accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District 
is part of the 

public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board 
of Education 

and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma. The general operating authority f
or the public 

school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected me
mbers. The 

appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has c
onsidered all 

potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reportin
g entity was 

made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (
GASB). The 

basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting
 entity is the 

governing body's ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifes
tation of this 

ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight 
responsibility 

include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the designation of mana
gement, the 

ability to significantly influence operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A second crit
erion used in 

evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this crite
rion involves 

considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity
 is conducted 

within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. A 
third criterion 

used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting 
entity is the 

existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exerc
ise oversight 

responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential com
ponent units 

included in the District's reporting entity. These statements present only the activities of the D
istrict 

B. Measurement Focus 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the 
results of its 

operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to 
aid financial 

management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities. 

A fund is an independent accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. The accou
nt groups are 

financial reporting devices designed to provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities
 that are not 

recorded directly in the funds. 

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each cate
gory, in turn, 

is divided into separate "fund types." The District has the following fund types and account gro
ups: 

Governmental Funds 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the 

collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or
 construction 

of general fixed assets (capital project funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt 
(debt service 

funds). Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, regar
dless of the 

measurement focus applied. All governmental type funds are accounted for using the
 Regulatory 

(Statutory) basis of accounting. All revenues from all sources, including property taxes, 
entitlements, 

grants, and shared revenues are recognized when they are received, rather than earned. 
Expenditures 

are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved, rather than at the time the relat
ed liability is

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

with expendable, available financial resources. Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash 

basis of accounting. These practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 

States of America 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to 

be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include local property taxes and federal and 

state funding. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools, except for 

programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and 

other long'.'"term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be 

expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are used for proceeds of specific revenue sources that 

are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for the 

purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing 
furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for technology center property, for 

paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and 

casualty insurance premiums for center facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying 
salaries of security personnel. 

Co-op Fund - The co-op Fund is established when the boards of education of tWo or more school 

districts enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs. The revenues necessary to 
operate a cooperative program can come from federal, state, or local sources, including the individual 

contributions of participating school districts. The expenditures for this fund would consist of those 
necessary to operate and maintain the joint programs. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The child nutrition fund consists of revenues from local collections, state, and 
federal sources used to benefit the food service program. 

Municipal Tax Lew Fund - In 2003, the City of McAlester passed sales tax measures. A portion of 
the tax was earmarked for the McAlester School District. The monies received by the District are 

designated for construction, capital expenditures and general facilities repair and maintenance. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's sinking fund and is used to account for the 

accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest. The 

primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings 
from temporary investments. · 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's bond fund and is used to account for the 

proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new 

school facilities, renovating existing facilities and acquiring transportation equipment. 

Fiduciary Funds 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other 

governments or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms of 

a trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and reporting. Agency funds generally are 

used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve 

measurement of results of operations. 

Expendable Trust Funds - Expendable trust funds typically include the gifts and endowments fund. The 

District maintained a gifts and endowment fund during the 2017-18 fiscal year. · 

Gifts and Endowments Fund - The gifts and endowments fund receives its assets by way of 
philanthropic foundations, individuals, or private organizations for which no repayment or special 

service to the contributor is expected. This fund is used to promote the general welfare of the District.

PITTSBURG COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-,REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Agency Funds - The agency fund is the school activities fund, which is used to account for 
monies, 

collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored group
s. The 

administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursin
g, and 

accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only
 to establish 

accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to accoun
t for all 

long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund 
and the 

amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal. 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, pl
ant, and 

equipment of the school district. The District does not maintain the information necessary to
 include 

this group in its combined financial statements. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by th
e Oklahoma 

State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form of
 presentation 

used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34, Ba
sic Financial 

Statements-Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. 
This format 

significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and d
isbursements 

modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education
 (OSDE) as 

follows: 
• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 

the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure when the obligation is paid. 

• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group. Fixed assets are
 not 

depreciated. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United 

States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and
 measurable, 

or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related 
liabilities are 

incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

Prior to July 1 each year, the governing board of the school district prepares a verified applica
tion showing 

the needs of the school district and submits the application to the County Excise Board,
 who makes 

temporary appropriations for lawful current expenses of the school district. The temporary a
ppropriations 

are merged with the annual appropriations when the annual budget for the school dist
rict is finally 

approved. 

Prior to October 1 each year, the school Board of Education must make a financial statement,
 showing the 

true fiscal condition of the school as of the close of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, a
long with an 

itemized statement of estimated needs and probable income from all sources for the fiscal yea
r. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the general fund and special reven
ue fund(s) of 

the school district.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Encumbrances represent commitments to unperformed contracts for goods or service
s. Encumbrance 

accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources 
are recorded as 

expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the District. 
Under Oklahoma 

Law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of the year. 

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum
 only" to indicate 

that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not
 present financial 

position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted acco
unting principles. 

Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund eliminations have not b
een made on the 

aggregation of this data. 

Cash - Cash consists of currency and checks on hand, demand deposit accounts, with
 banks and other 

financial institutions. 

Investments - State statutes govern the District's investment policy. Permissible inv
estments include 

direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of depos
it of savings and 

loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings cert
ificates of savings 

and loan associations, and trust companies. Collateral is required for demand deposits 
and certificates of 

deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit insurance. Investments are stated 
at cost. 

Inventories - Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies held for c
onsumption. The 

value of consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District's financial state
ments. The costs 

of inventories are recorded as expenditures when encumbered and purchased; r
ather than when 

consumed. 

Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to 
be liquidated with 

expendable, available financial resources is reported as expenditure and a fun
d liability of the 

governmental fund that will pay it. There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vaca
tion leave that are 

not expected to be liquidated with expendable, available financial resources. 

No liability is recorded for non-vesting accumulating rights to receive such pay benefits 

Fixed Assets - The District has not maintained a record of its general fixed assets, an
d, accordingly, a 

General Fixed Asset Account Group is not included in the financial statements. Gen
eral fixed assets 

purchased are recorded as expenditures in the various funds at the time of purchase. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund w
hen due or when 

resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the fo
llowing year. For 

other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable, 
available financial 

resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion o
f such obligations 

is reported in the general long-term debt account group. 

Cash Fund Balance - Cash fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purc
hase order, legal 

contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

F. Revenues, Expenses and Expenditures 

Local Revenues - Revenue from local sources is revenue produced within the scho
ol district, which 

includes ad valorem taxes. It is available for current educational expenses and fo
r other purposes 

authorized by the school board.

MCALESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-80 
PITTSBURG COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxe
s on real and 

personal property within the District. The county assessor, upon receipt of the certification
 of tax levies 

from the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the co
unty treasurer 

prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of
 receipt of the 

tax rolls. The first half of the tax is due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to Apr
il 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2
. Second half 

taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If taxes a
re delinquent 

and unpaid for a period of three years or more the real estate may be sold for such taxes. 

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is revenue from funds co
llected by an 

intermediate administrative unit or political sub-division, such as a county or municipality, and
 redistributed 

to the school district. 

State Revenues - Revenue from state sources for current operations are primarily governe
d by the state 

aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The S
tate Board of 

Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based o
n information 

accumulated from the districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Departmen
t of Education 

may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclose
d by review. 

Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the ye
ar when the 

adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational pro
grams. State 

Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expende
d only for the 

program for which the money is provided. These rules also require that the money not expen
ded, as of the 

close of the fiscal year, be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the sam
e categorical 

programs. The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program
 revenues be 

accounted for in the general fund. 

Federal Revenues - Revenue from Federal sources is money originating from the Federal go
vernment and 

made available to the school district either as direct grants or under various programs passe
d-through the 

State Department of Education and other State agencies. 

The Federal government also makes payments to school districts whose revenues are adve
rsely affected 

by the presence of Federal activities. Although these payments are made in consideration o
f lost property 

tax revenue, the Oklahoma State Department of Education advocates classifying such
 amounts as 

revenue from Federal sources. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly with 
the interaction 

between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a school classroo
m, in another 

location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning situations, such as those involving
 co-curricular 

activities. It may also be provided through some other approved medium, such as tele
vision, radio, 

telephone and correspondence. Examples of expenditures that might be included here are th
e activities of 

teacher assistant of any type (clerks, graders, teaching machines, etc.), which assist in th
e instructional 

process. The activities of tutors, translators, and interpreters would be recorded here. 
Department 

chairpersons who teach for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/transfer fees paid 
to other LEAs 

would be included here. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide administrative, tech
nical (such as 

guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance instruction. These ser
vices exist as 

adjuncts for fulfilling the objective of instruction, community services and enterprise program
s, rather than 

as entitles within them.

acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of buildings and additions to 

buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in equipment; and improvement 

to sites. 

Other Outlays Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds are not properly classified as

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to outside 

agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayments, non-qualified 

expenditures, and other refunds to be repaid from District funds. 

lnterfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or 

expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made 

from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that 

is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are reported as 

transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity 

transfers. 

Budgetary Information 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal Estimate of Needs (Budget) is required for all General and 

Special Revenue funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved budgeted 

appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for supplemental 

appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. The annual Estimate of Needs, when 

approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise 

Board, becomes the legal budget. Supplemental appropriations, if required, were made during the year 

and are reflected on the budget vs. actual presentations shown included in supporting schedules. 

2. Deposit Categories of Credit Risk 

Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal 

· deposit insurance. The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible 

investments include:

========== 

This lease purchase liability has been reflected in the financial statements under the General Long Term 
Debt Account Group. 

The district has leasing arrangements covering various school land and equipment which are accounted 
for as operating leases and hence, the property and equipment do not change ownership. These lease 
arrangements are as follows: 

On November, 28, 2000, the school district entered into a ninety-nine (99) year lease with the City of 
McAlester for one dollar. The school district is leasing approximately 7.62 acres for ballfields, stands, 
concessions, sports buildings and related sports activities to be operated by the school district. The school 
district is responsible for the maintenance of the ballfields, any equipment, buildings or improvements of 
the premises and must pay for all utility cost related to the facilities. 

On July, 13, 2015, the school district leased certain premises to the McAlester Building Foundation, Inc. 
from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018 for one dollar. The McAlester Building Foundation, Inc. agreed to 
improve the building subject to the lease, including storm window placement and heating and air 
conditioning units. The school district is responsible for all utilities, including electrical service, gas, water, 
sewer and trash services as well as provide grounds keeping services and janitorial services and 
maintenance of the common areas of the building. It was also engaged that the Superintendent of Schools 
and one member of the Board of Education would serve as members of the Board of Directors of the 
McAlester Building Foundation, Inc. 

On February 11, 2013, the school district leased approximately 2.64 acres of land to the City of McAlester 
for one dollar for a period of 99 years to be used as a canine recreational park. The City of McAlester has 
the responsibility for maintenance of the property and any improvements and payment for all utility cost 
related to the facilities.

4. Employee Retirement System · 

Description of Plan 

The District participates in the .state-administrated Teacher's Retirement System of Oklahoma (the 

"system"), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system. The supervising 

authority for the management and operation of the System is a 13-member Board of Trustees, which acts 

as a fiduciary for investment of the funds and the application of plan interpretations. The System provides 

retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments, death benefits and other benefits to 

plan members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statutes establish benefit provisions and may be 

amended only through legislative action. The District has no responsibility or authority for the operation 

and administration of the system nor has it any liability, except for contribution requirements. The 

Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial 

statements and required supplementary information for the System. The report may be obtained by writing 

to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73152. 

Basis of Accounting 

The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of 

interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are 

made. Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized 

disclosed measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the 

present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee 

services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no 

actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an under-funded pension 

benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 

Funding Policy 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. The contribution 

rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes. 

The rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee's earnings plus employer-

paid fringe benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation. 

Additionally, OTRS receives "federal matching contributions" for positions whose funding comes from 

federal sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable 

compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its 

revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. The District 

contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% 

during this year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System to make the 

required contributions on behalf of the participating members. The school is required to pay 16.5% for any 

compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits. 

Annual Pension Cost 

The District's total contribution for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $2,264,786.30, $2,078,035.49, and 

$2,239,658.15 respectively. The District's total payroll for fiscal year 2017-18 amounted to $13,312, 133.64. 

5. Litigation 

The District is contingently liable for lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of its operations. The 

settlement of such contingencies under the budgetary process would require appropriation of revenues yet 

to be realized, and would not materially affect the financial position of the District at June 30, 2018.

MCALESTER SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-80 
PITTSBURG COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. For all federal programs, the District uses the fund types prescribed by the Oklahoma State 

Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 

Oklahoma. General and Child Nutrition Funds are used to account for resources restricted, or 

designated for, specific purposes by a grantor. Federal and state financial assistance generally is 

accounted for in the General and Child Nutrition Fund. 

2. The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its' measurement 

focus. The Governmental Fund types are accounted for using a current financial measurement focus. 

All federal grant funds were accounted for in the General and Child Nutrition Funds. With this 

measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities and the fund balance are included on the 

balance sheet. Operating statements of these funds present increases and decreases in net current 

assets. 

The Regulatory Basis of Accounting is used for the Governmental Fund types and Agency Funds. 

This basis of accounting recognizes revenue from all sources when they are received. Federal grant 

funds are considered to be recognized when encumbered or reserved to the extent of expenditures 

made under the provisions of the grant. 

3. Positive amounts listed in the either "Balance at July 1, 2017" or "Balance at June 30, 2018" column 

represent funds received by the school and not yet expended or coded to the program. Negative 

amounts represent expenditures which have been claimed, but the revenue not yet collected. 

4. The District received donated foods through the Federal Food Distribution Program (10.555). At June 

30, 2018, the school maintained an immaterial amount of food commodities inventory. Per the 

Regulatory Basis of Accounting, the commodities received and used are not recognized as revenue or 

expenditures in the school's Financial Statements. 

5. The District has not elected to use the 10% de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform 

Guidance. 

6. Reconciliation of the Revenue shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards to Statement 

of Revenue, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is as follows:

REPORTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
McAlester School District No. 1-80 
Pittsburg County, Oklahoma 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America arid 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-
regulatory basis within the combined financial statements of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg 
County, Oklahoma (District}, as listed in the Table of Contents; as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and 
have issued my report thereon dated January 8, 2019, which was .adverse with respect to the presentation of 
the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and 
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, 
my report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account group with respect to the 
presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State 
Board of Education. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the ci.rcumstances 
for the purpose of expressing my opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section 
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal 
control that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been 
identified 

35 



Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of material 

misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and 
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 

financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 

objective of my audit, arid accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no 

instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 

Standards. However, I noted certain immaterial instances of noncompliance that I have reported to 

management in the "Schedule of Comments" on page 41 of this report. 

Purpose of this Report 

This report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 

testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 

considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 

other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; 

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF 
EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
McAlester School District No. 1-80 
Pittsburg County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the compliance of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma (District's) 

compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 

(OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District's major 
federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the 

summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 

applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs based 

on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of compliance in 

accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit · 

requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those 
standards and Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 

and material effect on a major program occurred. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence about 

the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as I consider 

necessary in the circumstances. 
. ' 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal 

program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, complied, in all material respects, with the 

types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 

major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

37 



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of McAlester School District No. 1-80, Pittsburg County, Oklahoma (District), is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District's 

internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on 
each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 

compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program, on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or 

combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that 
material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or 
detected and corrected on, a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over 
compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that I considered to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that haven 
not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of 
internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Uniform Guidance. 
Accordingly, this report is not su· le for any other purpose.

PITTSBURG COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

SUMMARY OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS 
JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018 

McAlester Public Schools is responsible for follow-up and corrective action on all audit findings. The summary 

of Prior Audit Findings is required to present the current year auditor's evaluation of whether the School District 

has taken appropriate corrective action to address findings and recommendations in the prior audit's Schedule 

of Findings and Questioned Costs. 

FINDING 2017-1 

Condition: During FY 2016-17, the School District's cumulative funds received from the National 

School Lunch and Breakfast programs exceeded cumulative reported expenditures for those programs; 

Balance at 
7/1/2016 

Lunch {Project 763) $ 262,232.87 

Breakfast {Project 764) $ 691,597.65 

Receipts 

$ 1,063,103.04 

$ 544,732.19 

Expenditures 

$ 984,181.03 

$ 495,522.98 

Balance at 
6/30/2017 

$ 341,154.88 

$ 740,806.86 

Recommendation: The District should ensure expenditures are properly coded in amounts which reflect 

the total amount received or claimed will have corresponding expenditures. 

Current Status: This finding was not repeated again during fiscal year 2018. The Lunch balance 

increased to $375,567.27 at June 30, 2018 and the Breakfast balance increased to $782, 199.17. 

However, the Oklahoma State Department of Education has granted them permission to zero out these 

carryover balances going forward. 

FINDING 2017-2 

Condition:. During 2016-17, the school coded $21,172.00 of school wide property insurance expense to 

National School Lunch Program (Project) 763. This amount represented 10% of the total property 

insurance expenses. The school could not provide a rationale to justify that the method of allocation was in 

reasonable proportion to the total expense. 

Recommendation: The school district should monitor all federal expenditures coded to federal awards 

to ensure they are allowable cost for that program under the Uniform Guidance. 

Current Status: This finding was corrected in the 2017-18 school year.
