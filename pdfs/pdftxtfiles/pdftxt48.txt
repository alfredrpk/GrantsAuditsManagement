The Honorable Board of Education 
Ada School District Nci. 1-19 
Pontotoc County, Oklahoma 

Report on Financial Statements 

Independent Auditor's Report 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements - regulatory 
basis of the Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 
30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with financial reporting provisions prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted 
my audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amount and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my 
qualified audit opinion. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note 1 (C) to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by the Ada 
School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1 (C) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, 
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse Opinion on 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraphs, the financial statements referred to in the first 
paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, the financial position of Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma as of 
June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in financial position for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not include the general fixed asset account 
group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by .the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset 
account group is not known. · 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on 
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the financial statements referred to. in the first paragraph 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, 
Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for 
the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in the Note 1 (C). 

Other Matters 
Other Information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial 
statements within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-regulatory basis, 
and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under supplementary information, are presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined financial statements of the 
District. The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis 
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part 
of the basic financial statements. 

The combining financial statements-regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, 
under supplementary information and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting 
records used to prepare the combined financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the 
combined financial statements, and other additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the combined financial 
statements, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America. In my opinion, the supplementary information including the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined · 
financial statements taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 (C). 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated January 7, 2019, 
on my consideration of Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma's, internal control over 
financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts 
and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of my testing 
of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide 
an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part 
of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in 
assessing the results of my audit.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



ADA SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-19 
PONTOTOC COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying financial statements of the Ada School District No. 1-19 (the "District") conform to the 

regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis of accounting prescribed by the 

Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the 

State of Oklahoma. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present 

financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 

the United States of America. The District's accounting policies are described in the following notes that 

are an integral part of the District's financial statements. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and, 

accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the 

public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education 

and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma. The general operating authority for the public 

school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The 

appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered all 

potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was 

made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The 

basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the 

governing body's ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this 

ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight responsibility 

include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the designation of management, the 

ability to significantly influence operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in 

evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion involves 

considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted 

within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. A third criterion 

used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the 

existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight 

responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units 

included in the District's reporting entity. These statements present only the activities of the District. 

B. Measurement Focus 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its 

operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial 

management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities. 

A fund is an independent accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. The account groups are 

financial reporting devices designed to provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are not 

recorded directly in the funds. 

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, 

is divided into separate "fund types." The District has the following fund types and account groups: 

Governmental Funds 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, including the 

collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction 

of general fixed assets (capital project funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service 

funds). Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the 

measurement focus applied. All governmental type funds are accounted for using the Regulatory 

(Statutory) basis of accounting. All revenues from all sources, including property taxes, entitlements, 

grants, and shared revenues are recognized when they are received, rather than earned. Expenditures 

are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved, rather than at the time the related liability is 

incurred. Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain compensated

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

with expendable, available financial resources. Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash 

basis of accounting. These practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 

States of America. 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to 

be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include local property taxes and federal and 

state funding. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools, except for 

programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and 

other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be 

expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are used for proceeds of specific revenue sources that 

are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for the 

purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing 
furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for technology center property, for 

paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and 
casualty insurance premiums for center facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying 

salaries of security personnel. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The child nutrition fund consists of revenues from local collections, state, and 

federal sources used to benefit the food service program. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's sinking fund and is used to account for the 

accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest. The 

primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings 

from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's bond fund and is used to account for the 

proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new 

school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment. 

Fiduciary Funds 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other 

governments or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms of 

a trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and reporting. Agency funds generally are 

used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve 

measurement of results of operations. 

Private-Purpose Trust Funds - Private-Purpose Trust funds are used to report trust arrangements 

under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments ... 
The school's Gifts and Endowment fund is classified as a Private-Purpose Trust fund. 

Agency Funds - The agency fund is the school activities fund, which is used to account for monies, 

collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The 
administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursing, and 
accounting for these activity funds.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish 

accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for all 

long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund and the 
amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal. 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, plant, and 

equipment of the school district. The District does not have the information necessary to include this 
group in its combined financial statements. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma 

State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form of presentation 

used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASS Statement No. 34, Basic Financial 

Statements-Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. This format 
significantly differs from that required by GASS 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements 

modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as 

follows: 
• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 

the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 
• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long:-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure when the obligation is paid. . 

• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group. Fixed assets are not 
depreciated. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 

States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, 

or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are 

incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

Prior to July 1 each year, the governing board of the school district prepares a verified application showing 

the needs of the school district and submits the application to the County Excise Board, who makes 

temporary appropriations for lawful current expenses of the school district. The temporary appropriations 

are merged with the annual appropriations when the annual budget for the school district is finally 

approved. 

Prior to October 1 each year, the school Board of Education must make a financial statement, showing the 

true fiscal condition of the school as of the close of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, along with an 

itemized statement of estimated needs and probable income from all sources for the fiscal year. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the general fund and special revenue fund(s) of 

the school district. 

Encumbrances represent commitments to unperformed contracts for goods or services. Encumbrance 

accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as 

expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the District. Under Oklahoma 

Law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of the year.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate 

that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial 

position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund eliminations have not been made on the 

aggregation of this data. 

Cash - Cash consists of currency and checks on hand, demand deposit accounts with banks and other 

financial institutions. 

Investments - State statutes govern the District's investment policy. Permissible investments include 

direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and 

loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings 

and loan associations, and trust companies. Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of 

deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit insurance. Investments are stated at cost. 

Inventories - Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies held for consumption. The 

value of consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District's financial statements. The costs 

of inventories are recorded as expenditures when. encumbered and purchased, rather than when 

consumed. 

Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated with 

expendable, available financial resources is reported as expenditure and a fund liability of the 

governmental fund that will pay it. There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation leave that are 

not expected to be liquidated with expendable, available financial resources. 

No liability is recorded for non-vesting accumulating rights to receive such pay benefits 

Fixed Assets - The District has not maintained a record of its general fixed assets, and, accordingly, a 

General Fixed Asset Account Group is not included in the financial statements. General fixed assets 

purchased are recorded as expenditures in the various funds at the time of purchase. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due or when 

resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For 

other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable, available financial 

resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations 

is reported in the general long-term debt account group. 

Cash Fund Balance - Cash fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase order, legal 

contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

F. Revenues, Expenses and Expenditures 

Local Revenues - Revenue from local sources is revenue produced within the school district, which 

includes ad valorem taxes. It is available for current educational expenses and for other purposes 

authorized by the school board. 

The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 

personal property within the District. The county assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies 

from the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer 

prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the 

tax rolls. The first half of the tax is due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half 

taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If taxes are delinquent 

and unpaid for a period of three years or more the real estate may be sold for such taxes.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is revenue from funds collected by an 

intermediate administrative unit or political sub-division, such as a county or municipality, and redistributed 

to the school district. 

State Revenues - Revenue from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state 

aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of 

Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information 

accumulated from the districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education 

may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. 

Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the 

adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State 

Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 

program for which the money is provided. These rules also require that the money not expended, as of the 

close of the fiscal year, be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical 

programs. The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be 

accounted for in the general fund. 

Federal Revenues - Revenue from Federal sources is money originating from the Federal government and 

made available to the school district either as direct grants or under various programs passed-through the 

State Department of Education or other State Agencies. 

The Federal government also makes payments to school districts whose revenues are adversely affected 

by the presence of Federal activities. Although these payments are made in consideration of lost property 

tax revenue, the Oklahoma State Department of Education advocates classifying such amounts as 

revenue from Federal sources. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly with the interaction 

between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a school classroom, in another 

location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning situations, such as those involving co-curricular 

activities. It may also be provided through some other approved medium, such as television, radio, 

telephone and correspondence. Examples of expenditures that might be included here are the activities of 

teacher assistant of any type (clerks, graders, teaching machines, etc.), which assist in the instructional 

process. The activities of tutors, translators, and interpreters would be recorded here. Department 

chairpersons who teach for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/transfer fees paid to other LEAs 

would be included here. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide administrative, technical (such as 

guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance instruction. These $ervices exist as 

adjuncts for fulfilling the objective of instruction, community services and enterprise programs, rather than 

as entitles within them. 

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures - Activities concerned with providing non-

instructional services to students, staff, and the community. 

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures - Consist of activities involved with the 

acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of buildings and additions to 

buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in equipment; and improvement 

to sites. 

Other Outlays Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds are not properly classified as 

expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These are classified as Other Outlays. 

These include debt service payments (principal and interest).

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Other Uses Expenditures - This includes scholarships provided by private gifts and endowments; student 

aid and staff awards supported by outside revenue sources (i.e., foundations). Also, expenditures for self-

funded employee benefit programs administered either by the District or a third party administrator. 

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to outside 

agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayments, non-qualified 

expenditures, and other refunds to be repaid from District funds. 

lnterfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or 

expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made 

from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that 

is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are reported as 

transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity 

transfers. 

Budgetary Information 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal Estimate of Needs (Budget) is required for all General and 

Special Revenue funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved budgeted 

appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for supplemental 

appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. The annual Estimate of Needs, when 

approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise 

Board, becomes the legal budget. Supplemental appropriations, if required, were made during the year 

and are reflected on the budget vs. actual presentations shown included in supporting schedules. 

2. Deposit Categories of Credit Risk 

Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal 

deposit insurance. The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible 

investments include: 

1. Direct obligations of the United States Government to the payment of which the full faith and credit 

of the government is pledged. 

2. Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged. 

3. Certificates of deposits of banks when such certificates of deposits are secured by acceptable 

collateral as in the deposit of other public monies. 

4. Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations to the extent that such 

accounts or certificates are fully insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. 

5. Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral consisting of those items specified in 

paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section including obligations of the United States, its agencies and 

instrumentalities, and where collateral has been deposited with a trustee of custodian bank in an 

irrevocable trust or escrow account established for such purposes. 

6. County, municipal or school district direct debt obligations for which an ad valorem tax may be 

levied or bond and revenue anticipation notes, money judgments against such county, municipality 

or school district ordered by a court of record or bonds or bond and revenue anticipation notes 

issued by a public trust for which such county, municipality or school district is a beneficiary thereof. 

All collateral pledged to secure public funds shall be valued at no more than market value.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Deposit Categories of Credit Risk (continued) 

7. Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and which 

investments consist of obligations of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, and 

investments in those items listed above. 

8. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district. 

9. Qualified pooled investment programs, the investments of which consist of those items specified 

above, as well as obligations of the United States agencies and instrumentalities, regardless of the 

size of the district's budget. To be qualified, a pooled investment program for school funds must be 

governed through an lnterlocal cooperative agreement formed pursuant to Title 70 Section 5-117b, 

and the program must competitively select its investment advisors and other professionals. Any 

pooled investment program must be approved by the Board of Education. 

The District's investment policy instructs the treasurer to minimize risks by diversifying the investment 

portfolio; structuring investments so that securities mature in time to meet cash requirements; and by 

investing the full amount of all accounts of the District. 

Custodial Credit Risk: 

Deposits and Investments - The District's demand deposits are required by law to be collateralized by the 

amount that is not federally insured. 

Securities pledged as collateral are held by a third party or Federal Reserve Bank. Joint custody 

safekeeping receipts are held in the name of the depositing institution, but are pledged to the District. The 

security cannot be released, substituted, or sold without the School Treasurer's approval and release of 

the security. 

Certificates of deposit are collateralized at least by the amount not federally insured. As of June 30, 2018, 

the District had no deposits exposed to custodial credit risk. 

The District had no investments at June 30, 2018. 

Interest Rate Risk: 

Investments are made based upon prevailing market conditions at the time of the transaction with the 

intent to hold the instrument until maturity. However, the District has no formal written policy addressing 

interest rate risk. 

Credit Risk: 

The District has no formal written policy addressing credit risk. 

At June 30, 2018, the District has no investments that are not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the 

United States Government.

3. General Long-Term Debt 

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be 

received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by 

the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be 

fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. 

General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable and capital leases payable. Debt service 

requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and future revenues of the debt service fund. 

Capital leases are generally paid from Capital Projects funds. 

A brief description of the outstanding general obligation bond issues at June 30, 2018, is set forth below:

General long-Term Debt (continued) 

Interest expense incurred on general long-term debt during the current year totaled $63,935.00. 

The school district's lease-purchase commitments include property financed through a technique referred 

to as "conduit financing." Conduit financing involves the use of a public trust which issues conduit debt 

obligations (limited-obligation revenue bonds, certificates of participation, or similar debt instruments) for 

the express purpose of providing capital financing for a specific third party that is not a part of the issuer's 

financial reporting entity. The public trust has no obligation for such debt beyond the resources provided 

by a lease or loan with the third party, on whose behalf the debt is issued. The school district has an 

outstanding obligation on a lease-purchase of this type at June 30, 2018. 

The Pontotoc County Public Facilities Authority (the Authority) issued Ada Public Schools Project Revenue 

Bonds Series 2014, dated June 1, 2014, in the aggregate principle amount of $11,485,000.00. The school 

district leased ground to the Authority to provide a tract of land on which to make building improvements 

and purchase equipment and fixtures. Subsequent to making the improvements, the Authority sub-leased 

the property and improvements back to the school district pursuant to a sub-lease for a period of twelve 

(12) years, or until such time as the indebtedness is retired. The lease/rental payments derived from the 

sub-lease are assigned to a trustee who applies them to debt service payments on the Authority's revenue 

bonds. 

The school district's lease payment schedule is designed to coincide with the Authority's debt service 

payments. The school district taxpayers have previously approved a proposition to issue a series of 

general obligation bonds defining each series by purpose and amount of proceeds that each series will 

provide. The bonds are to be issued in series so that at no time the total bonds outstanding will exceed the 

amount allowed under the constitution of Oklahoma. The school district is using the proceeds of these 

general obligation bonds to finance the installments of the lease-purchase obligation. The lease purchase 

financing was used to construct and equip school facilities and purchase copiers. 

The following schedule reflects future lease-purchase payments for all outstanding agreements: 

Year ending 
June 30, Payments 

2019 $ 1,539, 150.00

2024-26 4,617,450.00 

Total $ 12,313,200. 00 

The above leases contain a clause that gives the District the ability to terminate the lease agreements at 

the end of each fiscal year. The District has recorded the liability for future lease payments in the General 

Long Term Debt Account Group.

Changes in General Long-Term Debt - (continued) 

The District has eleven (11) copier lease purchase agreements with outstanding balances at June 30, 

2018. During the fiscal year 17-18, three (3) of the copier lease purchase agreements totaling $8, 724.57 

were paid from General Fund and eight (8) of the copier lease purchase agreements totaling $20,776.92 

were paid from the School District Activity Fund. 

4. Employee Retirement System 

Description of Plan 

The district participates in the state-administrated Teacher's Retirement System of Oklahoma (the 

"system"), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system. The supervising 

authority for the management and operation of the System is a 13-member Board of Trustees, which acts 

as a fiduciary for investment of the funds and the application of plan interpretations. The System provides 

retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments, death benefits and other benefits to 
plan members and beneficiaries. · Oklahoma State Statutes establish benefit provisions and may be 

amended only through legislative action. The district has no responsibility or authority for the operation 

and administration of the system nor has it any liability, except for contribution requirements. The 

Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial 

statements and required supplementary information for the System. The report may be obtained by writing 

to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73152. 

Basis of Accounting 

The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of 

interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are 

made. Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized 

disclosure measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the 

present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee 

services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no 

actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an under-funded pension 

benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 

Funding Policy 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. The contribution 

rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statues. 

The rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee's earnings plus employer-

paid fringe benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation. 

Additionally, OTRS receives "federal matching contributions" for positions whose funding comes from 

federal sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14.0% of applicable 

compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its 

revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income tax. The District 

contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% 

during this year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System to make the 

required contributions on behalf of the participating members. The school is required to pay 16.5% for any 

compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits. 

Annual Pension Cost 

The District's total contributions to the system for years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were 

retirement $1,945,063.92, $1,341,966.00, and $1,355,726.00 respectively. The District's total payroll for 

fiscal year 2017-18 amounted to $11,837,955.52.

5. Litigation 

The District is contingently liable for lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of its operations. The 

settlement of such contingencies under the budgetary process would require appropriation of revenues yet 

to be realized, and would not materially affect the financial position of the District at June 30, 2018. 

6. Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 

assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial 

insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials 

liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in 

any of the past three fiscal years. 

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is transfer 

or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASB No. 10, the School 

reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the 

Oklahoma School Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' 

compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. In that capacity, OSAG is 

responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract 

arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for 

any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is required 

to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the 

District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses 

based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund, 

so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use 

their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest. 

7. Surety Bonds 

The District has bond coverage through. the Western Surety Company in the amount of $1,000 each, 

covering certain district employees as custodians of school activity funds and education funds for the term 

of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. 

The treasurer is bonded by Travelers Casualty and Surety Company, bond number 105430559, for the

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. For all federal programs, the District uses the fund types prescribed by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 
Oklahoma. General and Child Nutrition Funds are used to account for resources restricted, or 
designated for, specific purposes by a grantor. Federal and state financial assistance generally 
is accounted for in the General and Child Nutrition Fund. 

2. The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its' 
measurement focus. The Governmental Fund types are accounted for using a current financial 
measurement focus. All federal grant funds were accounted for in the General and Child 
Nutrition Funds. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities and the 
fund balance are included on the balance sheet. Operating statements of these funds present 
increases and decreases in net current assets. 

The Regulatory Basis of Accounting is used for the Governmental Fund types and Agency 
Funds. This basis of accounting recognizes revenue from all sources when they are received. 
Federal grant funds are considered to be recognized when encumbered or reserved to the 
extent of expenditures made under the provisions of the grant. 

3. Positive amounts listed in the either "Balance at July 1, 2017" or "Balance at June 30, 2018" 
column represent funds received by the school and not yet expended or coded to the program. 
Negative amounts represent expenditures which have been claimed, but the revenue not yet 
collected. 

4. The District received donated foods through the Federal Food Distribution Program (10.555). At 
June 30, 2018, the school maintained an immaterial amount of food commodities inventory. Per 
the Regulatory Basis of Accounting, the commodities received and used are not recognized as 
revenue or expenditures in the school's Financial Statements. 

5. The District has not elected to use the 10% de mini mus indirect cost rate allowed under the 
Uniform Guidance. 

6. The District transferred $86,954.49, from Title II, Part A to Title I. This amount was expended as 
Title I, funds and is shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards in the Transfer 
In/ (Out) column.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Ada School District No. 1-19 
Pontotoc County, Oklahoma 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements~ 
regulatory basis within the combined financial statements of Ada School District No. 1-19 , Pontotoc County, 
Oklahoma (District), as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and 
have issued my report thereon dated January 7, 2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of 
the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and 
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, 
my report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account group with respect to the 
presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State 
Board of Education. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing my opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, I do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section 
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal 
control that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been 
identified. 

31 



Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and 
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 
financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 
objective of my audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 
Standards. I noted certain immaterial instances of noncompliance that I have reported to management in the 
"Schedule of Comments" on page 36 of this report. 

Purpose of this Report 

This report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 
considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 
other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL 
PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THESCHEDULE 

OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Ada School District No. 1-19 
Pontotoc County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the compliance of Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma (District's) 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 
OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District's major federal 
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary 
of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 
applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs based 
on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those 
standards and Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 
and material effect on a major program occurred. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence about 
the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as I consider 
necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, Ada School District, No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material respects, with 
the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of 
its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

33 



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of Ada School District No. 1-19, Pontotoc County, Oklahoma (District), is responsible for 

establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 

requirements referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District's 

internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on 

each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 

the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 

internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an 

opinion on effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the 

effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 

compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 

functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 

program, on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or 

combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that 

material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or 

detected and corrected on, a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a 

deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 

requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over 

compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 

of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 

material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 

compliance that I considered to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have 

not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of 

internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Uniform Guidance. 

Accordingly, this report is not suitaiJle for any other purpose.

ADA SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-19 
PONTOTOC COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

SCHEDULE OF COMMENTS 
JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018 

The following conditions represent areas noted during my review of the school's accounting system in which I 

feel improvements in the internal control and/or operational efficiency may be attained. I have also noted, as 

required, any noncompliance with State Department of Education Regulations. 

I. Condition: During our review of the activity fund we noted at the High School the sponsors would turn 

money into the secretary, with no receipt issued. Due to the procedure followed, we could not test the 

source receipts to determine all monies were deposited. 

We also noted the District did not have adequate controls related to what receipts books had been checked 

out and turned back in at the year end. We could not be certain all receipt books which were issued were 

returned and available for auditor review. 

The District did not use fundraiser reconciliation forms during the year. 

Recommendation: An effective internal control system within the activity fund receipting process is 

essential to determining that all of the monies collected are being properly and timely deposited and 

available for the student use as approved within each activity fund sub-account. The District should 

evaluate the current internal control system within the activity fund and strengthen the controls and/or 

implementation of these controls. Some controls to consider implementing are as follows: 

);;>- Activity fund records should be kept in an organized fashion that allows a third party to easily and 

effectively view each subaccount's receipts, expenditures and any fundraiser profit and loss forms for 

each fiscal year. 

);;>- At the beginning of each fiscal year a pre-numbered, triplicate receipt book should be issued to each 

subaccount sponsor/teacher who will collect monies. The activity custodian should be responsible for 

issuing the receipt books, keeping an accurate list of receipt books and ensuring that all receipt books 

are turned in at the end of each year. All receipt copies should remain intact in receipt books. If 

computerized receipts are used they must be pre-numbered and have all of the information as a hand 

written receipt would. Each receipt should be printed out in numerical sequence and provided for 

review. 

);;>- Any sponsor who collects money should be made aware of their responsibility of writing receipts, along 

with the processes and controls the District has in place for timely depositing and accurate tracing. 

Many times this is most effectively accomplished at a beginning of the year activity fund meeting with all 

the sponsors together. 

);;>- Any monies turned into the activity fund custodian should have a corresponding sponsor receipt or 

group of receipts that is easily traceable to the deposit turned into the custodian. This is most easily 

accomplished by the sponsor attaching the receipt the custodian issues to the receipt or group of 

receipts which make up the deposit. 

);;>- The District should require that any time products are sold as a fundraiser a Profit and Loss form is 

completed. These forms should be completed by the sponsors and turned into the activity fund 

custodian. It should be the responsibility of the activity fund custodian to ensure that these are both 

turned in timely and accurately filled out. 

);;>- Several other site secretaries including Ada Junior High School and Washington Elementary were not 

attaching the secretary receipt to the last receipt making up their deposit. Therefore, they were difficult 

or were unable to test their receipts to deposit tickets.

2. Condition: During our review of Activity Fund disbursements, we noted the following: 

»- Activity Fund (62) P.O. #24 to U.S. Bank Equipment Finance for purpose of copier/lease in amount of 
$6,067.11 included several "late fee" payments of $50/each as well as personal property tax of $157.61. 

»- Activity Fund (62) P.O. #60 to Cannon Financial Services for purpose of copier lease in amount of 
$1 ,303.31 included $60.21 of insurance charges from Cannon and $40.10 late payment fee, 

»- Activity Fund (68) P.O. #555 to Ada City Schools for purpose of reimbursing the General Fund for 
wages of concession workers paid by the General Fund in the amount of $17,575.79. However, the 
purchase order had no supporting documentation attached detailing out specific dates, amounts, or 
names of individual concession workers. · 

»- Activity Fund (63) P.O. #182 to and individual for the purpose of "football security" in the amount of 
$420.00. Supporting documentation consisted of a list of people who worked security, however the list 
was not signed or acknowledged by a school supervisor or other designated official who could verify 
that the work had been performed. 

Recommendation: School Administration should ensure that payment procedures are in place to avoid 
paying "late fees". 

Activity Fund disbursements made for the purpose of reimbursing the General Fund for wages of 
concession workers should be supported with documentation which lists the dates, times, names of 
concession workers, amounts and other relevant information needed to verify the actual disbursements. 

Activity expenditures for purposes of paying "football security"; "concession workers" or other similar 
services should be supported with the dates and times worked, individuals worked, and other relevant 
information. A school official, supervisor or other appropriate school designated person should sign 
supporting documentation verifying that the work had actually been performed.
