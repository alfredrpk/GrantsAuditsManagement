INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 

 
 
 
Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 
Norman, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the business type activities and aggregate 
discretely presented component unit of Cameron University (the University) an organizational unit of the 
Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma (the Regents), which is a component unit of the state 
of Oklahoma, which comprise the statement of net position as of June 30, 2018, and the related 
statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and cash flows for the year then 
ended, and the related notes to the financial statements which collectively comprise the entity’s basic 
financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not 
audit the financial statements of the University’s aggregate discretely presented component unit, 
Cameron University Foundation, as described in Note 1 of the financial statements. The Foundation’s 
financial statements were audited by another auditor, whose report has been furnished to us, and our 
opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Foundation, is based solely on the report of 
the other auditor. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement. The financial statements of the Foundation were 
audited by other auditors and were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 



Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion.  
 
Opinion 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of the University as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position 
and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America.  
 
Emphasis of Matters 
As discussed in Note 1, in 2018 the University adopted Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions.  
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of the University’s reporting entity are intended to 
present the financial position, changes in financial position, and cash flows of only the activities of the 
University and Foundation. They do not purport to, and do not, present fairly the financial position of the 
Regents as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position or its cash flows for the year then 
ended, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 
 
Other Matters 
Required Supplementary Information 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the 
management’s discussion and analysis and the required supplementary information, as listed in the 
table of contents, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, 
although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic 
financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied 
certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of 
management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for 
consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other 
knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an 
opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us 
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 
 
Other Supplementary Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise Cameron University’s basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of 
federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial 
statements. 
 



Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 
 

(3) 

The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is the responsibility of management and was derived 
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. 
In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial 
statements as a whole. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards  
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 11, 
2018, on our consideration of the University’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of 
its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other 
matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over 
financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on 
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit 
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the University’s internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance.

CAMERON UNIVERSITY 
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (UNAUDITED) 

JUNE 30, 2018 AND 2017 
 
 
 

(4) 

 
This section of Cameron University’s (the University) financial statements presents management’s 
discussion and analysis of the University’s financial performance during the year ended June 30, 2018. 
Since this management’s discussion and analysis is designed to focus on current activities, resulting 
change, and current known facts, it should be read in conjunction with the University’s basic financial 
statements and footnotes. The overview of the financial statements and financial analysis is presented 
for fiscal year 2018, with fiscal year 2017 data presented for comparative purposes. 
 
Financial Analysis of the University as a Whole 
The basic financial statements of the University are the statement of net position; statement of 
revenues, expenses, and changes in net position; and statement of cash flows. The statement of net 
position presents the financial position of the University at June 30, 2018. The statement of revenues, 
expenses, and changes in net position summarizes the University’s financial activity for the year ended 
June 30, 2018. The statement of cash flows, presented using the direct method, reflects the effects on 
cash that result from the University’s operating activities, investing activities, and capital and noncapital 
financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
The following schedules are prepared from the University’s basic financial statements. With the 
exception of the statement of cash flows, the statements are presented on an accrual basis of 
accounting whereby revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred 
and assets are capitalized and depreciated. 
 
Statement of Net Position 
This statement is presented in categories, namely assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, 
deferred inflows of resources, and net position. The assets are classified between current and 
noncurrent assets. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts 
receivable, and other assets. Noncurrent assets include cash, cash equivalents, and investments that 
are restricted for long-term purposes, such as investment in capital assets, or have scheduled 
maturities exceeding one year. Noncurrent assets also include receivables restricted for investment in 
capital assets as well as capital assets. Capital assets include land, buildings and improvements, 
infrastructure, equipment, library materials, and construction in progress. Capital assets, with the 
exception of land and construction in progress, are shown net of depreciation. 
 
Deferred outflows of resources are consumptions of net position that are applicable to a future period. It 
includes costs associated with pensions. Deferred inflows of resources are acquisitions of net position 
that are applicable to a future period. It includes credits associated with debt restructure and pensions. 
 
Liabilities are also classified between current and noncurrent. Current liabilities include accounts 
payable, accrued expenses, unearned revenue, and the portion of noncurrent liabilities expected to be 
paid in the upcoming fiscal year. These liabilities represent obligations due within one year. Noncurrent 
liabilities include the portion of accrued compensated absences, capital lease obligation, and net 
pension obligation expected to be paid in fiscal year 2020 or thereafter. 
 
At June 30, 2018, the University had approximately $17 million in outstanding capital leases. Additional 
information related to the University’s long-term debt is presented in Note 5 to the financial statements. 
 
Total net position increased to $19.1 million in fiscal year 2018 from $16.6 million in fiscal year 2017.

Financial Analysis of the University as a Whole (Continued) 
Operating revenues includes tuition and fees net of scholarship discounts and allowances, grants and 
contracts, sales and services, auxiliary enterprises, and other. These revenues increased by $.1 million 
in 2018. Tuition and fees revenue decreased by $.1 million from 2017 to 2018. Grants and contracts 
and auxiliary enterprises had a combined increase of $.4 million in 2018. 
 
The majority of nonoperating revenues are made up of state appropriations and Pell grant revenues. 
There was a significant decrease of $1.3 million in state appropriations in fiscal year 2018 as compared 
to fiscal year 2017.  
 
The University’s operating expenses are classified by natural classification, including employee 
compensation, scholarships, contractual services, etc. In fiscal year 2018, operating expenses 
decreased by $1.8 million primarily due to decreases in compensation, supplies and materials, 
scholarships, and depreciation expense. Compensation decreased due to vacancies in full-time faculty 
and staff. Conserative spending resulted in a decrease in supplies and materials. The scholarship 
decrease was due to the reduction in Oklahoma’s Promise scholarships and reduced funding for 
Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant recipients.

Foundation 
Cameron University Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation), is a legally separate, Oklahoma nonprofit 
corporation organized for the purpose of receiving and administering gifts intended for the University. 
Because the restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the 
University, the University’s management believes that presenting the Foundation’s financial statements 
as part of the University reporting entity provides users relevant and timely information about resources 
available to the University. The most recent financial statements of the Foundation are included under 
the heading “Foundation.” 
 
Economic Outlook 
The Oklahoma economy appears to be making a turn in the right direction and is gradually stabilizing. 
The reduction in state appropriations for fiscal year 2019 is only .1% compared to 6% and 16% in 
previous years. However, the University continues to see a decline in enrollment due to a decreasing 
population in southwest Oklahoma. Even with the positive future of the economy, the University 
continues to look for cost saving measures. Significant savings were realized when the University 
outsourced custodial services in fiscal year 2018. Management continues to monitor expenditures to 
ensure resources are used in the most effective and efficient manner. The University remains fully 
committed to increasing and improving student success and student learning inside and outside the 
classroom while continuing to be an engaged partner with common education, business, industry, civic 
and government organizations.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Nature of Operations 
Cameron University (the University) is a regional University operating under the jurisdiction 
of the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma (the Board of Regents) and the 
Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. 
 
Reporting Entity 
The University is one of four institutions of higher education in Oklahoma that comprise the 
Regents of the University of Oklahoma, which in turn is part of the Higher Education 
Component Unit of the state of Oklahoma. 
 
The Board of Regents has constitutional authority to govern, control, and manage the 
Regents of the University of Oklahoma, which consists of Cameron University, Rogers State 
University, University of Oklahoma-Norman Campus and University of Oklahoma Health 
Sciences Center. This authority includes but is not limited to the power to designate 
management, the ability to significantly influence operations, acquire and take title to real 
and personal property in its name, and appoint or hire all necessary officers, supervisors, 
instructors, and employees for member institutions. 
 
Accordingly, the University is considered an organizational unit of the Board of Regents of 
the University of Oklahoma reporting entity for financial reporting purposes due to the 
significance of its legal, operational and financial relationships with the Board of Regents, as 
defined in Section 2100 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) 
Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
In prior years, the University reported itself as a component unit of the state of Oklahoma. 
Based on an evaluation performed by management during 2015, it was determined that the 
University is not a legally separate entity. Therefore, it is not a component unit of the State. 
The University is an organizational unit with the Board of Regents as mentioned above. 
 
Cameron University Foundation 
Cameron University Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation), is a legally separate, Oklahoma 
nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of receiving and administering gifts intended 
for the University. Because the restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be 
used by, or for the benefit of, the University, the University’s management believes that 
presenting the Foundation’s financial statements as part of the University reporting entity 
provides users relevant and timely information about resources available to the University. 
The Foundation reports under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting 
Standards Codification (ASC). As such, certain revenue recognition criteria and presentation 
features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria and presentation features. No 
modifications have been made to the Foundation’s financial information for these 
differences. The Foundation prepares separate, standalone financial statements that may 
be obtained by contacting the Foundation’s management.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Financial Statement Presentation 
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the recognized standard-setting 
body for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. 
GAAP) applicable to public sector institutions of higher education. The University applies all 
applicable GASB pronouncements. 
 
Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus 
and the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under the accrual basis, 
revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded when an obligation has 
been incurred. All significant intra-agency transactions have been eliminated. 
 
Cash Equivalents 
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the University considers all highly liquid 
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Funds 
invested through the State Treasurer’s OK Invest cash management investment policy are 
considered cash equivalents. 
 
Investments 
The University accounts for its investments at fair market value based on quoted market 
prices. Changes in unrealized gain (loss) on the carrying value of investments are reported 
as a component of investment income in the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes 
in net position. 
 
Accounts Receivable 
Accounts receivable consist of tuition and fee charges to students and auxiliary enterprise 
services provided to students, faculty, and staff, the majority of each residing in the state of 
Oklahoma. Accounts receivable also include amounts due from the federal, state, and local 
governments or private sources, in connection with reimbursement of allowable 
expenditures made pursuant to the University’s grants and contracts. Accounts receivable 
are recorded net of estimated uncollectible amounts. The University determines its 
allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts 
receivable are past due, the University’s previous loss history, and the condition of the 
general economy and the industry as a whole. The University writes off specific accounts 
receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such 
receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
 
Restricted Cash and Investments 
Cash and investments that are externally restricted for debt service payments, maintain 
sinking or reserve funds, long-term student loans, or to purchase capital or other noncurrent 
assets are classified as noncurrent assets in the statement of net position.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Capital Assets 
Capital assets are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition or fair market value at the date 
of donation in the case of gifts. The University’s capitalization policy is all items with a unit 
cost of $5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater than one year. Renovations to 
buildings, infrastructure, and land improvements that significantly increase the value or 
extend the useful life of the structure are capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance are 
charged to operating expense in the year in which the expense was incurred. 
 
Costs incurred during construction of long-lived assets are recorded as construction in 
progress and are not depreciated until placed in service. The University capitalizes interest 
as a component of capital assets constructed for its own use. There was no capitalized 
interest in 2018. 
 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 
the assets, generally 40 years for buildings, 25 years for infrastructure and land 
improvements, and 7 years for library materials and equipment, or the duration of the lease 
term for capital leases. 
 
Unearned Revenues 
Unearned revenues include amounts received for tuition and fees and certain auxiliary 
activities prior to the end of the fiscal year but related to the subsequent accounting period. 
Unearned revenues also include amounts received from grant and contract sponsors that 
have not yet been earned. 
 
Compensated Absences 
Employee vacation pay is accrued at year-end for financial statement purposes. The liability 
and expense incurred are recorded at year-end as accrued expenses in the statement of net 
position and as a component of compensation and benefit expense in the statement of 
revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. 
 
Noncurrent Liabilities 
Noncurrent liabilities include (1) principal amounts of capital lease obligations with 
contractual maturities greater than one year; (2) amounts for accrued compensated 
absences; (3) net pension liability; and other liabilities that will not be paid within the next 
fiscal year. Bond discounts and premiums are amortized over the life of the bonds using the 
straight line method, which is not significantly different from the effective interest method. 
Bond issuance costs are expensed as incurred regardless of whether they are included in 
bond proceeds.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Pensions 
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and 
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about 
the fiduciary net position of the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (OTRS) and 
additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the 
same basis as reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of 
employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the 
benefit terms. Investments held by OTRS are reported at fair value. 
 
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB) 
For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and 
deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, information about the 
fiduciary net position of Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System (OTRS) and additions 
to/deductions from OTRS's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis 
as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, OTRS recognizes benefit payments when 
due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair 
value, except for money market investments and participating interest-earning investment 
contracts that have a maturity at the time of purchase of one year or less, which are 
reported at cost. 
 
Net Position 
The University’s net position is classified as follows: 
 

Net Investment in Capital Assets 
The net investment in capital assets component of net position consists of capital assets, 
net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of bonds, notes, 
or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement 
of those assets. Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that 
are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets or 
related debt are also included in this component of net position. To the extent debt has 
been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not included as 
a component of net investment in capital assets. 
 
Restricted Net Position – Expendable 
Restricted expendable net position includes resources in which the University is legally 
or contractually obligated to spend said resources in accordance with restrictions 
imposed by external third parties or through enabling legislation. 
 
Restricted Net Position – Nonexpendable 
Nonexpendable restricted net position consists of endowment and similar type funds in 
which donors or other outside sources have stipulated, as a condition of the gift 
instrument, that the principal is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity, and invested 
for the purpose of producing present and future income, which may either be expended 
or added to principal.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Net Position (Continued) 
Unrestricted Net Position 
Unrestricted net position represents resources derived from student tuition and fees, 
state appropriations, and sales and services of educational departments and auxiliary 
enterprises. These resources are used for transactions relating to the educational and 
general operations of the University, and may be used at the discretion of the governing 
board to meet current expenses for any purpose. These resources also include auxiliary 
enterprises, which are substantially self-supporting activities that provide services for 
students, faculty, and staff. 
 
When an expense is incurred that can be paid using either restricted or unrestricted 
resources, the University’s policy is to first apply the expense towards restricted 
resources, and then towards unrestricted resources. 
 

Classification of Revenues 
The University has classified its revenues as either operating or nonoperating revenues 
according to the following criteria: 
 

Operating Revenues 
Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange 
transactions, such as (1) student tuition and fees, net of scholarship discounts and 
allowances, (2) sales and services of educational departments and of auxiliary 
enterprises, and (3) certain federal, state, and nongovernmental grants and contracts 
that relate specifically to revenues used for student financial assistance. 
 
Nonoperating Revenues 
Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of nonexchange 
transactions, such as gifts and contributions, and other revenue sources that are defined 
as nonoperating revenues by GASB, such as state appropriations, certain governmental 
grants, and investment income. 
 

Scholarship Discounts and Allowances 
Student tuition and fee revenues, and certain other revenues from students, are reported net 
of scholarship discounts and allowances in the statement of revenues, expenses and 
changes in net position. Scholarship discounts and allowances are the difference between 
the stated charge for goods and services provided by the University, and the amount that is 
paid by students and/or third parties making payments on the students’ behalf. Certain 
governmental grants, such as Pell grants, and other federal, state or nongovernmental 
programs, are recorded as either operating or nonoperating revenues in the University’s 
financial statements. To the extent that revenues from such programs are used to satisfy 
tuition and fees and other student charges, the University has recorded a scholarship 
discount and allowance.

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

Deferred Outflows of Resources 
Deferred outflows are the consumption of net position by the University that are applicable 
to a future reporting period. At June 30, 2018, the University’s deferred outflows of 
resources were comprised of deferred outflows related to pensions. 
 
Deferred Inflows of Resources 
Deferred inflows are the acquisition of net position by the University that are applicable to a 
future reporting period. At June 30, 2018, the University’s deferred inflows of resources were 
comprised of credits realized on an OCIA lease restructure and deferred inflows related to 
pensions, and deferred inflows related to other post employment benefits. 
 
Income Taxes 
As a state institution of higher education, the income of the University is generally exempt 
from federal income taxes under Section 115(1) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as 
amended. However, the University may be subject to income taxes on unrelated business 
income under IRC Section 511(a)(2)(B). Such amounts have historically been insignificant. 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures; accordingly, actual 
results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Subsequent Events 
In preparing these financial statements, the University has evaluated events and 
transactions for potential recognition or disclosure through October 11, 2018, the date the 
financial statements were available to be issued.  
 
New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal Year 2018 
The University adopted the following new accounting pronoucements during the year ended 
June 30, 2018:

NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) 

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal Year 2018 (Continued) 
Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits 
Other Than Pensions (GASB No. 75) was issued in June 2015, became effective for the 
University beginning with its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The Statement replaces 
the requirements of GASB Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by 
Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions and requires 
governments to report a liability on the face of the financial statements for the OPEB 
they provide and outlines the reporting requirements by governments for defined benefit 
OPEB plans administered through a trust, cost-sharing OPEB plans administered 
through a trust and OPEB not provided through a trust. The Statement also requires 
governments to present more extensive note disclosures and required supplementary 
information about their OPEB liabilities. Some governments are legally responsible to 
make contributions directly to an OPEB plan or make benefit payments directly as OPEB 
comes due for employees of other governments. In certain circumstances, called special 
funding situations, the Statement requires these governments to recognize in their 
financial statements a share of the other government’s net OPEB liability. 

 
New Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted 
GASB has also issued a new accounting pronouncement which will be effective for the 
University in a future fiscal year. A description of the new accounting pronouncement and 
the University’s consideration of the impact of this pronouncement is described below: 

 
Statement No. 87, Leases (GASB No. 87) was issued in June 2017, will be effective for 
the University beginning with its fiscal year ending June 30, 2020. The Statement is to 
better meet the information needs of financial statement users by improving accounting 
and financial reporting for leases by governments. This Statement increases the 
usefulness of governments’ financial statements by requiring recognition of certain lease 
assets and liabilities for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and 
recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on the payment 
provisions of the contract. It establishes a single model for lease accounting based on 
the foundational principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying 
asset. Under this Statement, a lessee is required to recognize a lease liability and an 
intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease 
receivable and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and 
consistency of information about governments’ leasing activities. 
 

The University is currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on its 
financial statements.

NOTE 2 DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS 

Deposits 
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government’s deposits 
may not be returned to it. The University’s deposit policy for custodial credit risk is described 
as follows: 
 
Oklahoma Statutes require the State Treasurer to ensure that all state funds either be 
insured by Federal Deposit Insurance, collateralized by securities held by the cognizant 
Federal Reserve Bank, or invested in U.S. government obligations. The University’s 
deposits with the State Treasurer are pooled with the funds of other state agencies and 
then, in accordance with statutory limitations, placed in financial institutions or invested as 
the State Treasurer may determine, in the state’s name. 
 
The University requires that balances on deposit with financial institutions, including trustees 
related to the University’s bond indenture and capital lease agreements, be insured by 
Federal Deposit Insurance or collateralized by securities held by the cognizant Federal 
Reserve Bank, or invested in U.S. government obligations, in the University’s name. 
 
At June 30, 2018, the carrying amounts of the University’s deposits were $14,552,022. This 
amount consisted of deposits with the State Treasurer ($14,538,947) and petty cash and 
change funds ($13,075) at June 30, 2018. 
 
Some deposits with the State Treasurer are placed in the State Treasurer’s internal 
investment pool OK INVEST. OK INVEST pools the resources of all state funds and 
agencies and invests them in (a) U.S. treasury securities which are explicitly backed by the 
full faith and credit of the U.S. government; (b) U.S. agency securities which carry an implicit 
guarantee of the full faith and credit of the U.S. government; (c) money market mutual funds 
which participate in investments, either directly or indirectly, in securities issued by the U.S. 
treasury and/or agency and repurchase agreements relating to such securities; (d) 
investments related to tri-party repurchase agreements which are collateralized at 102% 
and, whereby, the collateral is held by a third party in the name of the State Treasurer; (e) 
collateralized certificates of deposits; (f) commercial paper; (g) obligations of state and local 
governments; and (h) State of Israel bonds. 
 
Of funds on deposit with the State Treasurer, amounts invested in OK INVEST total 
$4,345,770 at June 30, 2018. 
 
For financial reporting purposes, deposits with the State Treasurer that are invested in OK 
INVEST are classified as cash equivalents.

Total 4,345,770$       4,334,834$       
 

Agencies and funds that are considered to be part of the State’s reporting entity in the 
State’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report are allowed to participate in OK INVEST. 
Oklahoma statutes and the State Treasurer establish the primary objectives and guidelines 
governing the investment of funds in OK INVEST. Safety, liquidity, and return on investment 
are the objectives which establish the framework for the day to day OK INVEST 
management with an emphasis on safety of the capital and the probable income to be 
derived and meeting the State and its funds and agencies’ daily cash flow requirements. 
Guidelines in the Investment Policy address credit quality requirements, diversification 
percentages, and specify the types and maturities of allowable investments. The specifics 
regarding these policies can be found on the State Treasurer’s website at 
http://www.treasurer.state.ok.us/. 
 
The State Treasurer, at his discretion, may further limit or restrict such investments on a day 
to day basis. OK INVEST includes a substantial investment in securities with an overnight 
maturity as well as in U.S. government securities with a maturity of up to ten years. OK 
INVEST maintains an overall weighted average maturity of no more than four years. 
 
Participants in OK INVEST maintain an interest in its underlying investments and, 
accordingly, may be exposed to certain risks. As stated in the State Treasurer information 
statement, the main risks are interest rate risk, credit/default risk, liquidity risk, and U.S. 
government securities risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that during periods of rising interest 
rates, the yield and market value of the securities will tend to be lower than prevailing 
market rates; in periods of falling interest rates, the yield will tend to be higher. Credit/default 
risk is the risk that an issuer or guarantor of a security, or a bank or other financial institution 
that has entered into a repurchase agreement, may default on its payment obligations.

NOTE 2 DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED) 

Deposits (Continued) 
Liquidity risk is the risk that OK INVEST will be unable to pay redemption proceeds within 
the stated time period because of unusual market conditions, an unusually high volume of 
redemption requests, or other reasons. U.S. government securities risk is the risk that the 
U.S. government will not provide financial support to U.S. government agencies, 
instrumentalities or sponsored enterprises if it is not obligated to do so by law. Various 
investment restrictions and limitations are enumerated in the State Treasurer’s Investment 
Policy to mitigate those risks; however, any interest in OK INVEST is not insured or 
guaranteed by the State, the FDIC or any other government agency. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
The University does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a means of 
managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. 
 
Credit Risk 
All United States government obligations are held by the Federal Reserve Bank in the name 
of the University. Title 70, Section 4306, of the Oklahoma statutes directs, authorizes, and 
empowers the University’s Board of Regents to hold, invest, or sell donor-restricted 
endowments in a manner which is consistent with the terms of the gift as stipulated by the 
donor and with the provision of any applicable laws. 
 
The Board of Regents has authorized short-term funds to be invested in any security 
currently available through the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office. Generally, these include 
direct obligations of the United States government and its agencies, certificates of deposit, 
and demand deposits. The board has authorized endowment and similar funds to be 
invested in direct obligations of the United States government and its agencies, certificates 
of deposit, prime commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances, demand deposits, corporate 
debt (no bond below a Single A rating by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s 
Corporation may be purchased), convertible securities, and equity securities. 
 
Concentration of Credit Risk 
The University places no limit on the amount the University may invest in any one issuer. 
However, the majority of the investments are investments guaranteed by the U.S. 
government.

Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority Lease Obligations 
The Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority (OCIA) periodically issues bonds, which are 
allocated to the State Regents for Higher Education (the State Regents), to be used for 
specific projects at Oklahoma higher education institutions. The University has participated 
in these projects as discussed below. In each of the transactions, OCIA and the University 
have entered into a lease agreement with terms characteristic of a capital lease. As a result, 
the University recognizes its share of the liability and the related assets in connection with 
the projects being constructed or acquired, in its financial statements. Annually, the State 
Legislature appropriates funds to the State Regents to make the monthly lease principal and 
interest payments on-behalf of the University. 
 
In September 1999, OCIA issued its OCIA Bond Issues, 1999 Series A, B, and C. Of the 
total bond indebtedness, State Regents allocated $1,200,000 to the University. Concurrently 
with the allocation, the University entered into a lease agreement with OCIA, representing 
the project being funded by the OCIA bonds. 
 
Through June 30, 2018, the University has drawn its total allotment for expenditures 
incurred in connection with the project. The expenditures have been capitalized as 
investments in capital assets in accordance with University policy. The University has 
recorded a lease obligation payable to OCIA for the total amount of the allotment, less 
repayments made.

NOTE 5 LONG-TERM LIABILITIES (CONTINUED) 

Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority Lease Obligations (Continued) 
In 2004, the University’s lease agreement with OCIA was restructured through a refunding 
of the 1999 Series bonds to OCIA Bond Series 2004A. During fiscal year 2015, OCIA issued 
Bond Series 2014B to refund Bond Series 2004A. The restructured lease agreement with 
OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be 
issued to refund earlier bond issues. The University’s aforementioned lease agreement with 
OCIA was automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring 
resulted in a reduction of principal, thus the University has recorded a deferred inflow of 
resources of $31,856, which is the difference between the reacquisition price and the net 
carrying amount of the old debt, that is being amortized over the remaining life of the old 
debt or the life of the new debt, whichever is shorter. As of June 30, 2018, the unamortized 
credit totaled $6,371. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and 
interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of 
$54,471, which approximates the economic savings of the transaction. 
 
In November 2005, the OCIA issued its OCIA Bond Issues, 2005 Series F. Of the total bond 
indebtedness, the State Regents for Higher Education allocated $12,059,247 to the 
University. Through June 30, 2018, these funds have earned $1,203,081 of interest income. 
Concurrently with the allocation, the University entered into an individual lease agreement 
with OCIA, representing the six projects being funded by the OCIA bonds. 
 
Through June 30, 2018, the University has drawn $13,262,328 for expenditures incurred in 
connection with the projects. The expenditures have been capitalized as investments in 
capital assets in accordance with University policy. The University has recorded a lease 
obligation payable to OCIA for the total amount of the allotment, less repayments made. 
 
In 2011, the OCIA Series 2005F lease agreement was restructured through a partial 
refunding of OCIA’s 2005F bond debt. OCIA issued two new bonds, Series 2010A and 
2010B. The lease agreements with OCIA secure the OCIA bond debt and any future debt 
that might be issued to refund earlier bond issues. OCIA issued this new debt to provide 
budgetary relief for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 by extending and restructuring debt service. 
Consequently, the lease agreement with OCIA automatically restructured to secure the new 
bond issues. 
 
This lease restructuring has extended certain principal payments into the future, resulting in 
a charge or cost on restructuring. The University has recorded a deferred outflow of 
resources of $1,007,459, which is the difference between the reacquisition price and the net 
carrying amount of the old debt that is being amortized over the remaining life of the old debt 
or the life of the new debt, whichever is shorter. The deferred outflow has been completely 
amortized as of June 30, 2018. This restructuring resulted in an aggregate debt service 
difference for principal and interest between the original lease agreement and the 
restructured lease agreement of $49,791 which also approximates the economic cost of the 
lease restructuring. Although this restructuring resulted in a cost to the University, it is 
anticipated that the on-behalf payments provided to cover the original lease agreement will 
also cover the deferred lease restructuring charge.

During fiscal year 2015, the University’s remaining 2005 lease agreement with OCIA was 
restructured through a partial refunding of the Series 2005F bonds. OCIA issued new bonds, 
Series 2014A, to accomplish the refunding. The restructured lease agreement with OCIA 
secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be issued to 
refund earlier bond issues. The University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA 
was automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring 
resulted in a reduction of principal, thus the University has recorded a deferred inflow of 
resources of $343,613 on restructuring which is the difference between the reacquisition 
price and the net carrying amount of the old debt, that is being amortized over the remaining 
life of the old debt or the new debt, whichever is shorter. As of June 30, 2018, the 
unamortized credit totaled $253,745. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in 
principal and interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease 
agreement of $802,126, which approximates the economic savings of the transaction. 
 
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the State Regents made lease interest and principal 
payments totaling $1,551,610 on behalf of the University. These on-behalf payments have 
been recorded as on-behalf state appropriations restricted for debt service in the 
University’s statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. As stated above, 
the on-behalf payments are subject to annual appropriations by the State Legislature. 
 
Future minimum lease payments under the University’s obligation to the OCIA are as

In May 2006, the University entered into a 15-year lease agreement with the Oklahoma 
Development Finance Authority (the ODFA) and the State Regents as a beneficiary of a 
portion of the proceeds from the ODFA State Regents for Higher Education Master Lease 
Revenue Bonds, Series 2006A (the Master Lease 2006A). The University received a net 
amount of $6,100,235 of the proceeds for implementation of an energy management 
system. The University makes lease payments to the State Regents, who then forwards the 
payments to the trustee bank. 
 
During fiscal year 2016, the 2006 lease agreement with ODFA was restructured through a 
refunding of the Series 2006A bonds. The ODFA issued new bonds, Series 2016A, to 
accomplish the refunding. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal 
and interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of 
$228,927 which approximates the economic savings of the transaction.

The University’s academic and nonacademic personnel are covered by various retirement 
plans depending on job classification. The plans available to University personnel include: 
 

Name of Plan/System Type of Plan
Oklahoma Teachersʼ Retirement System (OTRS) Cost Sharing Multiple Employer Defined Benefit Plan
Cameron University Defined Contribution Plan Defined Contribution Plan
Supplemental Retirement Annuity Defined Benefit Plan
Cameron University Presidentʼs Retirement Plan (Plan 2) Defined Benefit Plan

 
Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System 

Plan Description 
The University participates in the OTRS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public 
employee retirement system that is self-administered. OTRS provides retirement, 
disability, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are 
established and may be amended by the legislature of the state of Oklahoma. Title 70 of 
the Oklahoma State Statutes assigns the authority for management and operation of 
OTRS to the board of regents of the System. OTRS issues a publicly available annual 
financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS/. 
 
Benefits Provided 
OTRS provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final compensation, age, 
and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon 
disability and to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 
defines all retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions 
rests with the State Legislature. 
 
Benefit provisions include: 
 
Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years of 
credited Oklahoma service. Members who joined OTRS on June 30, 1992 or prior are 
eligible to retire at maximum benefits when age and years of creditable service total 80. 
Members joining OTRS after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their 
age and years of creditable service total 90. Members whose age and service do not 
equal the eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as early as age 55, and as late as 
age 65 receive unreduced benefits based on their years of service. The maximum 
retirement benefit is equal to 2% of final compensation for each year of credited service.

NOTE 6 RETIREMENT PLANS (CONTINUED) 

Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (Continued) 
Benefits Provided (Continued) 
Final compensation for members who joined OTRS prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as 
the average salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for 
members joining OTRS after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five 
consecutive years of annual compensation in which contributions have been made. The 
final average compensation is limited for service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 
to $40,000 or $25,000, depending on the member’s election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 
of this amount. Service credits accumulated after June 30, 1995 are calculated based on 
each member’s final average compensation, except for certain employees of the two 
comprehensive universities. Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired, the 
designated beneficiary shall receive the member’s total contributions plus 100% of 
interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with interest rates varying based on 
time of service. A surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, in lieu of 
the aforementioned benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled to at the 
time of death as provided under the Joint Survivor Benefit Option. 
 
Upon the death of a retired member, OTRS will pay $5,000 to the designated 
beneficiary, in addition to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the 
member. 
 
A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. 
The disability benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable 
years of credited service. 
 
Upon separation from OTRS, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based 
on certain restrictions provided in the plan, or by the IRC. 
 
Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program 
up to the exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b). 
 
Contributions 
The contribution requirements of OTRS are at an established rate determined by 
Oklahoma Statute and are not based on actuarial calculations. Employees are required 
to contribute 7% of their annual compensation. The University pays the employee 
contributions as a pre-tax benefit to the employees. The University’s contribution rate is 
8.55% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The University’s contributions to 
OTRS in 2018, including both the employer share and the employee share, was 
approximately $3,490,000, equal to the required contributions. In addition, the state of 
Oklahoma also contributed 5% of state revenues from sales, use and individual income 
taxes to OTRS. The amounts contributed on-behalf of the University and recognized in 
the University’s statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position as both 
revenues and compensation and employee benefit expense in 2018 was $1,458,994. 
These on-behalf payments do not meet the definition of a special funding situation.

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred 
Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions 
At June 30, 2018, the University reported a liability of $33,844,429 for its proportionate 
share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 
2017 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was 
determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017. The University’s proportion of 
the net pension liability was based on the University’s contributions to OTRS relative to 
total contributions to OTRS by all participating employers for the year ended June 30, 
2017. Based upon this information, the University’s proportion was 0.51114353%. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the University recognized pension expense of 
$1,119,363. At June 30, 2018, the University reported deferred outflows of resources

Deferred pension outflows totaling $1,981,725 resulting from the University’s 
contributions subsequent to the measurement date, will be recognized as a reduction of 
the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2018. The deferred outflows totaling 
$481,084 resulting from the difference between projected and actual earnings on 
pension plan investments will be recognized in pension expense over five years. The 
deferred inflows totaling $2,310,649 resulting from differences between expected and 
actual experience and deferred inflows totaling $5,125,300 resulting from the changes of 
assumptions will be recognized in pension expense using the average expected 
remaining service life of the plan participants. The average expected remaining life of the 
plan participants is determined by taking the calculated total future service future service 
years of the plan divided by the number of people in the plan including retirees. The total 
future service years of the plan are estimated at 5.59 years at June 30, 2017 and are 
determined using the mortality, termination, retirement and disability assumptions 
associated with the plan. Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

Actuarial Assumptions 
The total pension liability was determined based on an actuarial valuation prepared as of 
July 1, 2017, using the following actuarial assumptions: 
 
 Actuarial Cost Method - Entry Age Normal 
 Amortization Method - Level percentage of Payroll 
 Remaining Amortization Period – 20 Years 
 Asset Valuation Method – 5-year smooth market 
 Inflation – 2.50% 
 Salary Increases - Composed of 2.50% inflation, plus 0.75% productivity increase 

rate, plus step-rate promotional increases for members with less than 25 years of 
service 

 Investment Rate of Return – 7.5% 
 Retirement Age - Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and 

gender. Adopted by the board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five year 
experience study for the period ending June 30, 2014 

 Mortality Rates after Retirement – Males: RP-2000 Combined Healthy mortality 
table for males with White Collar Adjustments. Generational mortality 
improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table’s base year of 2000. 
Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, scaled at 105%. 
Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table’s 
base year of 2012. 

 Mortality Rates for Active Members - RP-2000 Employee Mortality tables multiplied 
by 60% for males and 50% for females 

 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined 
using a building block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real 
rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) 
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the 
long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by 
the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. 
 
The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return 
for each major asset class as of June 30, 2017 are summarized in the following table:

**The Real Estate total expected return is a combination of U.S. Direct Real Estate 
    (unleveraged) and U.S. Value added Real Estate (unleveraged)

 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.5%. The projection of 
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan 
members will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions from 
employers will be made at contractually required rates, determined by state statutes. 
Projected cash flows also assume the state of Oklahoma will continue contributing 5.0% 
of sales, use and individual income taxes, as established by statute. Based on these 
assumptions, OTRS’ fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all 
projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term 
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of 
projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 
 
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate 
The following table presents the net pension liability of the University calculated using 
the discount rate of 7.5%, as well as what the University’s net pension liability would be if 
OTRS calculated the total pension liability using a discount rate that is 1-percentage

Defined Contribution Plan 
Plan Description 
The plan is a Section 401(a) defined contribution plan that became effective January 1, 
2015, for certain FLSA nonexempt employees. The purpose of the plan is to provide 
retirement benefits for the participants and to distribute the funds accumulated to the 
participants or the eligible beneficiaries. All nonexempt employees hired after the 
effective date are allowed a one-time election between participation in OTRS or the 
defined contribution plan. 
 
Funding Policy 
The required contribution rate is 9.0% of pensionable compensation. The University 
contributes the required amounts for participating members. The University’s 
contributions for the year ended June 30, 2018 were approximately $168,000. 
 

Supplemental Retirement Plan – Plan 1 
Plan Description 
The University maintains a supplemental retirement plan (Plan 1) for certain retired 
employees. The plan is in substance a single-employer, defined benefit plan 
administered by the University. Plan 1 has four participants, all of whom are retired and 
currently receiving benefits. Plan 1 guarantees the participants a level of retirement 
benefits when considering social security, OTRS and other retirement assets. The 
authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the Board of Regents. The 
plan does not issue a separate financial report, nor is it included in the financial report of 
another entity. 
 
Funding Policy 
The University has been funding the benefits of Plan 1 on a “pay-as-you-go” basis. 
Benefits are not distributed to the participants until their retirement. During the year 
ended June 30, 2018, the University contributed and paid benefits of $137,286 under 
Plan 1. 
 
Annual Pension Cost and Net Pension Obligation 
The annual required contributions for the year ended June 30, 2018, were determined as

Cameron University President’s Retirement Plan – Plan 2 
Plan Description 
The University maintains a supplemental retirement plan (Plan 2) for a retired University 
President. The plan is in substance a single-employer, defined benefit plan administered 
by the University. Plan 2 has one participant, who is retired and currently receiving 
benefits. Plan 2 guarantees the participant a level of retirement benefits when 
considering social security, OTRS and other retirement assets. The authority to establish 
and amend benefit provisions rests with the Board of Regents. The plan does not issue 
separate a financial report, nor is it included in the financial report of another entity. 
 
Benefits Provided 
Plan 2 is a defined benefit plan that may provide a University benefit for the life of the 
participant. The retirement benefit which is to be provided to the participant will be a 
guaranteed amount equal to the participant’s average compensation, as defined in the 
plan document, when considering the OTRS benefit and other benefits. 
 
Contributions 
Contributions required to fund the cost of the pension and other benefits provided by 
Plan 2 shall be made solely by the University. The University shall contribute to Plan 2 in 
such amounts and at such times as the University shall determine, acting under the 
advice of the actuary for Plan 2. Actual payments of contributions may be made at any 
time permitted by law or regulation. 
 
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred 
Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions 
At June 30, 2018, the University reported a liability of $260,938 related to Plan 2. The 
net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2018 and the total pension liability 
used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
June 30, 2018. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the University recognized pension 
expense of $60,311. Deferred outflows totaling $56,052 and deferred inflows of $79,197 
resulting from the difference between projected and actual earnings on pension plan 
investments will be recognized in pension expense over five years.

Actuarial Assumptions 
The total pension liability was determined based on an actuarial valuation prepared as of 
June 30, 2018 using the following actuarial assumptions: 
 
 Actuarial Cost Method - Entry Age Normal 
 Asset Method - Market Value of Assets 
 Inflation - 3.00% 
 Salary Increases - Not applicable. 
 Discount Rate and Long-Term Expected Rate of Return - 6.00% 
 Mortality - RP-2000 Combined Mortality Table, projected to 2017 using Scale AA 

 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 6.00%. The projection 
of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that plan member 
contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions will be 
made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution rates 
and the member rate. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net 
position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of 
current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the 
total pension liability. 
 
Long-Term Expected Rate of Return 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined 
using a building-block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected 
returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each 
major asset class. These expected future real rates of return are combined to produce 
the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of 
return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Best 
estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the 
pension plan’s target asset allocation as of June 30, 2018 are 7.0% with 85% of assets 
being invested in equities, 3% with 3% of assets being invested in bonds, and 1.5% with 
12% of assets being invested in cash.

Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (Continued) 
A. Contributions  

The contribution requirements of OTRS are at an established rate determined by 
Oklahoma Statute and are not based on actuarial calculations. Employees are required 
to contribute 7% of their annual compensation. The University pays the employee 
contributions as a pre-tax benefit to the employees. The University’s contribution rate is 
8.55% for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. The University’s contributions to 
OTRS in 2018, including both the employer share and the employee share, was 
approximately $3,490,000, equal to the required contributions. In addition, the state of 
Oklahoma also contributed 5% of state revenues from sales, use and individual income 
taxes to OTRS. The amounts contributed on-behalf of the University and recognized in 
the University’s statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position as both 
revenues and compensation and employee benefit expense in 2018 was $1,458,994. 
These on-behalf payments do not meet the definition of a special funding situation. 
 

B. Net OPEB Liability 
The University’s net OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total 
OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial 
valuation as of that date. 
 
Actuarial Assumptions 
The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2018 actuarial valuation was determined using 
the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, 
unless otherwise specified: 
 
Inflation 3%
Salary Increases Composed of 3.25% inflation, including 2.5% price inflation, 

plus .75% productivity increase rate, plus step-rate promotional
increased for members with less than 25 years of service. 

Investment rate of return 7.5%
Healthcare cost trend rates not applicable as the benefit provided is a set dollar amount not 

impacted by health care costs  
 
Mortality rates were based on the RP-2000 Combined Healthy mortality table for males 
with White Collar Adjustments for males. GRS Southwest Region Teacher Moratality 
Table, scales at 105% was used for females. 
 
The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2018 valuation were based on the 
results of an actuarial experience study for the period ended June 30, 2017.

B. Net OPEB Liability (Continued) 

Actuarial Assumptions (Continued) 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined 
using a building block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real 
rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) 
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the 
long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by 
the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. 
 
The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return 
for each major asset class as of June 30, 2017 are summarized in the following table: 
 

Long-Term
Target Asset Expected Real

Asset Class Allocation Rate of Return
Domestic Equity 38.5%                 7.5%                   
International Equity 19.0                    8.5

Total 100.0%

**The Real Estate total expected return is a combination of US Direct Real Estate 
   (unleveraged) and US Value added Real Estate (unleveraged)  
 
Discount Rate 
The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 7.5 percent. The 
projection of cash flows used to determine the single discount rate assumed that plan 
member and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and 
remain a level percentage of payroll. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB plan's 
fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB 
payments for current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected 
rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit 
payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

Other Postemployment Insurance Benefits 
The University provides for the payment of premiums for a $4,000 life insurance policy to all 
eligible individuals retiring from employment. To be eligible, the individuals need only have 
completed the requirements to retire under the OTRS. The University funds the payments 
out of current operations and does not prefund the expenses. For the year ended June 30, 
2018, the amount of expense to the University was approximately $5,700. 
 
Additionally, the University offers life insurance for all current employees in an amount equal 
to twice the employee’s current salary. The University has ceded all claims over $75,000 to 
an insurance company via the purchase of a group life insurance policy. As the employees 
have no vested benefit in this program and the program can be discontinued at the 
discretion of the University, the University has not recorded a liability in connection with any 
future benefit payments. 
 
At June 30, 2018, the University had approximately $1,871,000 of rate stabilization reserves 
with the administrator of the programs discussed above. The rate stabilization reserves are 
available upon request of the University and are reflected as prepaid expenses and other 
assets in the statement of net position.

Foundation’s revenues and other support are derived principally from contributions and its 
activities are conducted in the southwestern Oklahoma area. 
 
Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the 
Foundation, substantially all of the Foundation’s resources and related income are restricted 
by donors for the benefit of the University. Because these restricted resources held by the 
Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University, the Foundation is 
considered a component unit of the University and is discretely presented in the University’s 
financial statements.

Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(Continued) 
 
Basis of Presentation 
The financial statements of the Foundation have been prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting. Net assets and revenues, gains, and losses are classified based upon the 
existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions as follows: 
 
Unrestricted net assets: Net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed stipulations. 
 
Temporarily restricted net assets: Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations that can 
be fulfilled by actions of the Foundation pursuant to those stipulations or that expire by the 
passage of time. 
 
Permanently restricted net assets: Net assets subject to donor-imposed stipulations that 
they be maintained permanently by the Foundation. Generally, the donors of such assets 
permit the Foundation to use all or part of the income earned on the assets. 
 
Income and gains on investments are reported as increases in permanently restricted net 
assets if the terms of the gift that gave rise to the investment or applicable law require such 
amounts to be added to permanent endowment principal. Income and gains are reported as 
increases in temporarily restricted net assets if the terms of the gift or applicable law impose 
restrictions on the use of the income and as increases in unrestricted net assets in all other 
cases. 
 
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues, expenses, gains, losses, and other changes in net assets during the 
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Cash Equivalents 
The Foundation considers all liquid investments with original maturities of three months or 
less to be cash equivalents. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, cash equivalents consisted 
primarily of money market and cash in banks.

NOTE 12 CAMERON UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION (CONTINUED) 

Note 1: Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
(Continued) 
 
Contributions 
The Foundation reports gifts of cash and other assets as restricted contributions when they 
are received with donor stipulations that limit the use of the donated assets. When the intent 
of the donor is that the assets are to remain in perpetuity and the Foundation does not have 
the right to invade the original principal, the assets are reported as permanently restricted. 
When the donor restrictions expire, such as when the Foundation expends the funds in 
accordance with the donor’s wishes, temporarily restricted net assets are released to 
unrestricted net assets and reported in the statements of activities as net assets released 
from restrictions. 
 
Promises to Give 
Unconditional promises to give are recognized as revenues or gains in the period received 
and as assets, decreases of liabilities, or expenses, depending on the form of the benefits 
received. Conditional promises to give are recognized only when the conditions on which 
they depend are substantially met and the promises become unconditional. 
 
Collections 
All collections of works of art, historical treasures, and similar assets are capitalized. Items 
added to the collections are capitalized at cost if purchased or at estimated fair value on the 
acquisition date, if donated. Collection items sold or removed are reported as unrestricted or 
temporarily restricted gains or losses depending on donor stipulations, if any, placed on the 
items at the time of acquisition. 
 
Credit Risk 
The Foundation maintains cash balances at a financial institution located in Oklahoma. 
From time to time, the account balance may exceed the limits insured by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management does not consider this to be an unreasonable 
risk of loss. 
 
Real Property 
Real property consists primarily of land and farm property donated to the Foundation. 
Management has made attempts to revalue portions of the real property assets at 
subsequent dates. The Foundation’s management is of the opinion that revaluation of all the 
real property would not have a significant impact on the Foundation’s statements of financial 
position or changes in net assets. 
 
Assets Held for Sale 
The Foundation received contributed property during the year ended June 30, 2018 that 
totaled $522,952. The Foundation recorded this in-kind contribution as assets held for sale. 
The Foundation intends to sell this property as soon as possible.

(Continued) 
 
Marketable Securities 
Marketable securities are stated at fair value. Fair values are generally determined based 
upon quoted market prices. Realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities are 
computed on the first-in, first-out basis. 
 
The Foundation utilizes various investment instruments. Marketable securities, in general, 
are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit, and overall market volatility. Due 
to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is reasonably possible that 
changes in the values of marketable securities will occur in the near term and that such 
changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the statements of financial position. 
Significant fluctuations in fair values could occur from year to year and the amounts the 
Foundation will ultimately realize could differ materially. 
 
Income Taxes 
The Foundation is exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal 
Revenue Code and a similar provision of state law; and is classified as a public charity 
under section 509(A)(3). However, the Foundation is subject to federal income tax on any 
unrelated business taxable income. 
 
Other Assets 
Other assets consist of mineral interests stated at depletion value and property held for sale 
stated at fair value at date of donation.  
 
Subsequent Events 
Subsequent events have been evaluated through September 21, 2018 which is the date the 
financial statements were issued. 
 
Note 2: Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The Foundation maintains several bank accounts. The table below is designed to disclose 
the level of custody credit risk assumed by the Foundation based upon how its deposits 
were insured at June 30, 2018 and 2017. FDIC regulations state time and savings accounts 
are insured up to a $250,000 maximum. 
 
Category 1 – Insured by FDIC or collateralized with securities held by the Foundation or by 
its agent in its name. 
 
Category 2 – Uninsured but collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial 
institution’s trust department or agent in the Foundation’s name. 
 
Category 3 – Uninsured and uncollateralized.

Note 5: Real Property 
 
Real property consists of land and farm property donated to the Foundation and is held for 
the production of income. Real property with a carrying amount of $235,000 at June 30, 
2018 and 2017 is part of permanently restricted net assets. Real property with a carrying 
value of $3,000 at June 30, 2018 and 2017 is part of unrestricted net assets. 
 
Note 6: Notes Payable 
 
On June 26, 2001, the Foundation entered into a non-recourse agreement with a bank 
whereby the bank loaned the Foundation $1,000,000 for the purpose of allowing the 
University’s graduate investment class to manage an active bond portfolio (see Note 8). This 
non-recourse note had an original maturity date of June 30, 2002, but has been renewed 
annually with a current maturity date of November 30, 2018. Interest accrues on this note at 
the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill rate published in the Wall Street Journal plus 1.0% (2.89% at 
June 30, 2018). The non-recourse note is secured by a first and prior security interest in 
Cameron’s Investment Program fund. Income earned by the portfolio above the borrowing 
rate shall be donated to the Foundation for the purpose of sponsoring upper-level business 
majors in the pursuit of graduate degrees at the University. The balance at June 30, 2018 
and 2017 was $682,768 and $703,031, respectively. The balance is due within the first year. 
 
During the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Foundation paid $16,007 
and $9,717 for interest associated with this note payable.

NOTE 12 CAMERON UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION (CONTINUED) 

Note 9: Fair Value Measurements (Continued) 
 
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of assets and 
liabilities in the financial statements. 
 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: The carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the 
short maturity of such amounts. 
 
Investments: Investments in cash and cash equivalents, publicly traded securities, and 
mutual funds are stated at market value based on quoted market prices. Investments, 
common trust funds, certificates of deposit, government agency bonds and mortgage-
backed securities are stated at market price as determined by the fund manager or 
quoted market prices in non-active markets. Other investments are stated at fair value 
based upon current market conditions and other factors deemed relevant to the 
valuation as provided by the independent valuation specialist and or Foundation 
management. 
 
Cameron Investment Program: Investments in cash, accrued interest, and corporate 
bonds are stated at market value based on quoted market prices.  
 
Pledges and Accounts Receivable: The carrying amount of receivables is based on the 
discounted value of expected future cash flows, which approximate fair value. 
 
Other Assets: Remaining financial instruments are carried at cost, which approximates 
fair value. 
 
Accounts Payable and Other Liabilities: The carrying amount approximates fair value 
due to the short maturity of those amounts. 

 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a 
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The 
fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and 
minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of 
inputs that may be used to measure fair value are: 
 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
Level 2 Observable inputs other than the Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for 
similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs 
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market date for substantially 
the full term of the asset or liabilities. 
 
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that 
are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The following is a description of methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value 
on a recurring basis: 
 
Investments: Where quoted market prices are available in an active market, investments are 
classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 investments include equity 
securities, mutual funds, and money market funds. If quoted market prices are not available, 
then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with 
similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Level 2 investments include equity 
securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows, corporate and other bonds, 
U.S. government securities, marketable alternative assets, inflation hedging and 
opportunistic and other investments. In certain cases where Level 1 or Level 2 inputs are not 
available, investments are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy and include corporate 
and other bonds and marketable and nonmarketable alternative assets.

NOTE 12 CAMERON UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION (CONTINUED) 

Note 10: Endowments 
 
The Foundation endowments consist of approximately 200 individual funds established for a 
variety of purposes. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net 
assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of 
Directors to function as endowments, are classified and reported based upon the existence 
or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. 
 
Interpretation of Relevant Law: In accordance with the requirements of FAS 117-1, and the 
Oklahoma Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (OUPMIFA), the 
Foundation will report the market value of an endowment as perpetual in nature. As a result, 
the Foundation classifies as permanently restricted (1) the original value of gifts donated to 
the endowment, (2) the original value of subsequent gifts donated to the endowment, (3) all 
realized and unrealized gains and losses of the endowment, and (4) less any income 
distribution in accordance with the spending policy which will be classified as temporarily 
restricted. In accordance with OUPMIFA, the Foundation considers the following factors in 
making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 
 

(1) The duration and preservation of the fund; 
(2) The purpose of the foundation and the donor-restricted endowment fund; 
(3) General economic conditions; 
(4) The possible effect of inflation and deflation; 
(5) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments; 
(6) Other resources of the foundation; 
(7) The investment policies of the foundation. 

 
Return Objectives and Risk Parameters: The Foundation has adopted investment and 
spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of 
funding to programs supported by the endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing 
power of the endowment assets. Under this policy, as approved by the board of directors, 
the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results which 
generate a dependable, increasing source of income and appreciation while assuming a 
moderate level of investment risk. The goal of the Foundation is to provide a consistent rate 
of return of 4% over the rate of inflation as measured by the national Consumer Price Index 
(CPI), on a fee adjusted basis over a typical market cycle of no less than three years and no 
more than five years. Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. 
 
Strategies Employed for Achieving Objectives: To satisfy its long-term rate of return 
objectives, the Foundation relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are 
achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield 
(interest and dividends). The Foundation targets a diversified asset allocation that places a 
greater emphasis on equity-based investments to achieve its long-term return objectives 
while reducing risk to acceptable levels.

NOTE 12 CAMERON UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION (CONTINUED) 

Note 10: Endowments (Continued) 
 
Spending Policy and How the Investment Objectives Relate to Spending Policy: The 
Foundation has a policy of appropriating for distribution at the end of each year earnings in 
the form of dividends and interest that were earned during that year. In establishing this 
policy, the Foundation considered the long-term expected return on its endowment. 
Accordingly, over the long term, the Foundation expects the current spending policy to allow 
its endowment to grow at an average of 3% annually. This is consistent with the 
Foundation’s objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in 
perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new 
gifts and investment return.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 
BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 

ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITNG STANDARDS 
 
 
 
Board of Regents of the Univeristy of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 
Norman, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Cameron University 
(the University), an organizational unit of the Regents of the University of Oklahoma (the Regents), 
which is a component unit of the state of Oklahoma, which comprise the statement of net position as of 
June 30, 2018, and the related statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and 
cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued 
our report thereon dated October 11, 2018. Our report includes emphasis of matters paragraphs 
acknowledging that the University is an organizational unit of the Regents and these financial 
statements reflect only the assets, liabilities and revenues and expenses of the University and not the 
Regents as a whole. The Cameron University Foundation, Inc. (the Foundation) has been presented as 
part of the reporting entity. This legally separate organization was audited by other auditors. The 
Foundation was not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the University’s internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for 
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a 
timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 
 



Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 

(66) 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the University’s financial statements are free 
of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 
material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on 
compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express 
such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that 
are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
University’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the University’s internal control and 
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 

FEDERAL PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

 
 
 
Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 
Norman, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited the compliance of Cameron University (the University) with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of the University’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
University’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditors’ results section of the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grants applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for the University’s major federal program 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit 
of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code 
of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 
and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence about the University’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for the major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the University’s 
compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, the University complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program 
for the year ended June 30, 2018. 



Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma 
Cameron University 

(68) 

Other Matters 
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance, which is required to be 
reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs as Finding 2018-001. Our opinion on the major federal 
program is not modified with respect to these matters. 
 
The University’s response to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit are described in the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The University’s response was not subject to 
the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on 
the response. 
 
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
Management of the University is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control 
over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, we considered the University's internal control over compliance 
with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on its major federal program 
to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for the major federal program and to test and report on the 
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant 
deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe 
than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by 
those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance, as described in the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2018-001, that we consider to be significant 
deficiencies. 
 
Cameron University’s response to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit 
are described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. Cameron University’s 
response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, 
accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS

(71) 

 
NOTE 1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 

The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards includes the federal award 
activity of Cameron University under programs of the federal government for the year ended 
June 30, 2018. The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the 
requirements of 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and 
Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Because the Schedule 
presents only a selected portion of the operations of Cameron University, it is not intended 
to and does not present the financial position, changes in net assets, or cash flows of 
Cameron University. 
 
 

NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Expenditures reported on the Schedule are reported on the accrual basis of accounting. 
Such expenditures are recognized following the cost principles contained in the Uniform 
Guidance, wherein certain types of expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to 
reimbursement. The University has elected not to use the 10 percent de minimis indirect 
cost rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance. 
 
 

NOTE 3 FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM 

Under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (Direct Loan Program), the U.S. 
Department of Education makes loans to enable a student or parent to pay the costs of the 
student’s attendance at a postsecondary school. The Direct Loan Program enables an 
eligible student or parent to obtain a loan to pay for the student’s cost of attendance directly 
from the U.S. Department of Education rather than through private lenders. The University 
began participation in the Direct Loan Program on July 1, 2010. The University administers 
the origination and disbursement of the loans to eligible students or parents. The University 
is not responsible for the collection of these loans. 
 
 

NOTE 4 LOANS OUTSTANDING 

The University had $50,276 in Federal Perkins Loans outstanding at June 30, 2018. 
 
 

NOTE 5 SUBRECIPIENTS 

During the year ended June 30, 2018, the University did not provide any federal awards to
