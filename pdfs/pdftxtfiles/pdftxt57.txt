The Honorable Board of Education 
Duncan School District No. 1-1 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 

Report on Financial Statements 

Independent Auditor's Report 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements - regulatory 
basis of the Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with financial reporting provisions prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted 
my audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amount and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In 
making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation 
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's 
internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the 
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit 
opinion. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note 1 (C) to the financial statements, the financial statements are prepared by the 
Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting 
provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting 
described in Note 1 (C) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, 
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse Opinion on 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraphs, the financial statements referred to in the first 
paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, the financial position of Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County Oklahoma as 
of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in financial position for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not include the general fixed asset account 
group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset 
account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on 
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County 
Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for 
the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in the Note 1 (C). 

Other Matters 
Other Information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial 
statements within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-regulatory basis, 
and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under supplementary information, are presented for 
purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined financial statements of the 
District The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis 
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part 
of the basic financial statements. 

The combining financial statements-regulatory basis, and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, 
under supplementary information and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting 
records used to prepare the combined financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account group financial statements within the 
combined financial statements, and other additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the combined financial 
statements, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 
the United States of America. In my opinion, the supplementary information including the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined 
financial statements taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 (C). 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated January 7, 2019, 
on my consideration of Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County, Oklahoma's, internal control over 
financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts 
and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of my testing 
of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide 
an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part 
of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be considered in 
assessing the results of my audit . -~

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 



DUNCAN SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-1 
STEPHENS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The accompanying financial statements of the Duncan School District No. 1-1 (the "District") conform to the 

regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis of accounting prescribed by the 

Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the 

State of Oklahoma. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present 

financial position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 

the United States of America. The District's accounting policies are described in the following notes that 

are an integral part of the District's financial statements. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and, 

accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the 

public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education 

and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma. The general operating authority for the public 

school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The 

appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered all 

potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was 

made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The 

basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the 

governing body's ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this 

ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight responsibility 

include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the designation of management, the 

ability to significantly influence operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in 

evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion involves 

considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted 

within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. A third criterion 

used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the 

existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight 

responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units 

included in the District's reporting entity. These statements present only the activities of the District. 

B. Measurement Focus 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its 

operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial 

management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities. 

A fund is an independent accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. The account groups are 

financial reporting devices designed to provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are not 

recorded directly in the funds. 

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, 

is divided into separate "fund types." The District has the following fund types and account groups: 

Governmental Funds 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, including the 

collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction 

of general fixed assets (capital project funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service 

funds). Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the 

measurement focus applied. All governmental type funds are accounted for using the Regulatory 

(Statutory) basis of accounting. All revenues from all sources, including property taxes, entitlements, 

grants, and shared revenues are recognized when they are received, rather than earned. Expenditures 

are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved, rather than at the time the related liability is 

incurred.

DUNCAN SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-1 
STEPHENS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain compensated absences and 

claims and judgments are recognized when the obligations are expected to be liquidated with expendable, 

available financial resources. Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. 

These practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to 

be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include local property taxes and federal and 

state funding. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools, except for 

programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and 

other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be 

expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are used for proceeds of specific revenue sources that 

are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for the 

purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing 

furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for technology center property, for 

paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and 

casualty insurance premiums for center facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying 

salaries of security personnel. 

Insurance Fund - The insurance fund consists of revenues from reimbursements from insurances 

losses to be used to repair or replace damages. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's sinking fund and is used to account for the 

accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal and interest. The 

primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings 

from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's bond fund and is used to account for the 
proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new 

school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment. 

Fiduciary Funds 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other 

governments or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the terms of 

a trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and reporting. Agency funds generally are 

used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve 

measurement of results of operations. 

Private-Purpose Trust Funds - Private-Purpose Trust funds are used to report trust arrangements 

under which principal and income benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments. 

The School District's Gifts and Endowment Fund is considered to be a Private-Purpose Trust Fund. 

Agency Funds - The agency fund is the school activities fund, which is used to account for monies, 

collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The 

administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursing, and 

accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish 

accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for all 

long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund and the 

amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, plant, and 
equipment of the school district. The District does not have the information necessary to include this 
group in its combined financial statements. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form of presentation 
used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial 
Statements-Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. This format 
significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements 
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as 
follows: 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 
the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
• Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
• Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure when the obligation is paid. 
• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group. Fixed assets are not 

depreciated. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, 
or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are 
incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

Prior to July 1 each year, the governing board of the school district prepares a verified application showing 
the needs of the school district and submits the application to the County Excise Board, who makes 
temporary appropriations for lawful current expenses of the school district. The temporary appropriations 
are merged with the annual appropriations when the annual budget for the school district is finally 
approved. 

Prior to October 1 each year, the school Board of Education must make a financial statement, showing the 
true fiscal condition of the school as of the close of the previous fiscal year ended June 30, along with an 
itemized statement of estimated needs and probable income from all sources for the fiscal year. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the general fund and special revenue fund(s) of 
the school district. 

Encumbrances represent commitments to unperformed contracts for goods or services. Encumbrance 
accounting - under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as 
expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the District. Under Oklahoma 
Law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of the year. 

E. Assets. Liabilities and Fund Equity 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate 
that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund eliminations have not been made on the 

aggregation of this data.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS- REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

Cash - Cash consists of currency on hand and checks on hand, and demand deposit accounts with banks 

and other financial institutions. 

Investments - State statutes govern the District's investment policy. Permissible investments include 

direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and 

loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings 

and loan associations, and trust companies. Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of 

deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit insurance. Investments are stated at cost. 

Inventories - Inventories consist of minimal amounts of expendable supplies held for consumption. The 

value of consumable inventories at year-end is not material to the District's financial statements. The costs 

of inventories are recorded as expenditures when encumbered and purchased, rather than when 

consumed. 

Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated with 

expendable, available financial resources is reported as expenditure and a fund liability of the 

governmental fund that will pay it. There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation leave that are 

not expected to be liquidated with expendable, available financial resources. 

No liability is recorded for non-vesting accumulating rights to receive such pay benefits 

Fixed Assets - The District has not maintained a record of its general fixed assets, and, accordingly, a 

General Fixed Asset Account Group is not included in the financial statements. General fixed assets 

purchased are recorded as expenditures in the various funds at the time of purchase. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due or when 

resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For 

other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable, available financial 

resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations 

is reported in the general long-term debt account group. 

Cash Fund Balance - Cash fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase order, legal 

contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

F. Revenues, Expenses and Expenditures 

Local Revenues - Revenue from local sources is revenue produced within the school district, which 

includes ad valorem taxes. It is available for current educational expenses and for other purposes 

authorized by the school board. 

The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 

personal property within the District. The county assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies 

from the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer 

prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the 

tax rolls. The first half of the tax is due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half 

taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If taxes are delinquent 

and unpaid for a period of three (3) years or more the real estate may be sold for taxes. 

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is revenue from funds collected by an 

intermediate administrative unit or political sub-division, such as a county or municipality, and redistributed 

to the school district. 

State Revenues - Revenue from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state 

aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of 

Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information 

accumulated from the districts.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education 
may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. 
Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the 
adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
program for which the money is provided. These rules also require that the money not expended, as of the 
close of the fiscal year, be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical 
programs. The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be 
accounted for in the general fund. 

Federal Revenues - Revenue from Federal sources is money originating from the Federal government and 
made available to the school district either as direct grants or under various programs passed-through the 
State Department of Education or other state agencies. 

The Federal government also makes payments to school districts whose revenues are adversely affected 
by the presence of Federal activities. Although these payments are made in consideration of lost property 
tax revenue, the Oklahoma State Department of Education advocates classifying such amounts as 
revenue from Federal sources. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly with the interaction 
between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a school classroom, in another 
location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning situations, such as those involving co-curricular 
activities. It may also be provided through some other approved medium, such as television, radio, 
telephone and correspondence. Examples of expenditures that might be included here are the activities of 
teacher assistant of any type (clerks, graders, teaching machines, etc.), which assist in the instructional 
process. The activities of tutors, translators, and interpreters would be recorded here. Department 
chairpersons who teach for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/transfer fees paid to other LEAs 
would be included here. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide administrative, technical (such as 
guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance instruction. These services exist as 
adjuncts for fulfilling the objective of instruction, community services and enterprise programs, rather than 
as entitles within them. 

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures - Activities concerned with providing non-
instructional services to students, staff, and the community. 

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures - Consist of activities involved with the 
acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of buildings and additions to 
buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and other built-in equipment; and improvement 
to sites. 

Other Outlays Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds are not properly classified as 
expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These are classified as Other Outlays. 
These include debt service payments (principal and interest). 

Other Uses Expenditures - This includes scholarships provided by private gifts and endowments; student 
aid and staff awards supported by outside revenue sources (i.e., foundations). Also, expenditures for self-
funded employee benefit programs administered either by the District or a third party administrator. 

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to outside 
agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayments, non-qualified 
expenditures, and other refunds to be repaid from District funds. 

lnterfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or 
expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made 
from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that 
is reimbursed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are reported as 
transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity 
transfers. 

Budgetary Information 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal Estimate of Needs (Budget) is required for all General and 
Special Revenue funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved budgeted 
appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for supplemental 
appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. The annual Estimate of Needs, when 
approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise 
Board, becomes the legal budget. Supplemental appropriations, if required, were made during the year 
and are reflected on the budget vs. actual presentations shown included in supporting schedules. 

2. Deposit Categories of Credit Risk 

Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal 
deposit insurance. The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible 
investments include: 

1. Direct obligations of the United States Government to the payment of which the full faith and credit 
of the government is pledged. 

2. Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged. 

3. Certificates of deposits of banks when such certificates of deposits are secured by acceptable 
collateral as in the deposit of other public monies, 

4. Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations to the extent that such 

accounts or certificates are fully insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. 

5. Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral consisting of those items specified in 

paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section including obligations of the United States, its agencies and 
instrumentalities, and where collateral has been deposited with a trustee of custodian bank in an 
irrevocable trust or escrow account established for such purposes. 

6. County, municipal or school district direct debt obligations for which an ad valorem tax may be 
levied or bond and revenue anticipation notes, money judgments against such county, municipality 

or school district ordered by a court of record or bonds or bond and revenue anticipation notes 

issued by a public trust for which such county, municipality or school district is a beneficiary thereof. 

All collateral pledged to secure public funds shall be valued at no more than market value. 

7. Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and which 

investments consist of obligations of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, and 

investments in those items listed above. 

8. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district. 

9. Qualified pooled investment programs, the investments of which consist of those items specified 
above, as well as obligations of the United States agencies and instrumentalities, regardless of the 

size of the district's budget. To be qualified, a pooled investment program for school funds must be 
governed through an lnterlocal cooperative agreement formed pursuant to Title 70 Section 5-117b, 

and the program must competitively select its investment advisors and other professionals. Any 

pooled investment program must be approved by the Board of Education.

STEPHENS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA . 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Deposit Categories of Credit Risk (continued) 

The District's investment policy instructs the treasurer to minimize risks by diversifying the investment 

portfolio; structuring investments so that securities mature in time to meet cash requirements; and by 

investing the full amount of all accounts bf the District. 

Custodial Credit Risk: 

Deposits and Investments - The District's demand deposits are required by law to be collateralized by the 

amount that is not federally insured. 

The District participates in a money market mutual fund regulated by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission which invests in a portfolio of U.S. Treasury and government securities maturing in 397 days 

or less. 

The money market mutual fund investment is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other 

government agency. 

It is possible that interest or principal on securities of the money market mutual fund will not be paid when 

due. Money market funds try to minimize this risk by purchasing higher-quality securities. 

Interest Rate Risk: 

Investments are made based upon prevailing market conditions at the time of the transaction with the 

intent to hold the instrument until maturity. However, the District has no formal written policy addressing 

interest rate risk. 

Prices of fixed-income securities generally fall when interest rates rise. Interest rate changes have a 

greater effect on the price of fixed-income securities with longer maturities. 

Credit Risk: 

The District has no formal written policy addressing credit risk. 

At June 30, 2018, the District has no investments, except the money market mutual fund, that are not 

guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government. 

3. General Long-Term Debt 

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the. revenue to be 

received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by 

the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be 

fully paid serially within25 years from the date of issue. 

General long-term debt of the District includes of bonds payable and capital leases. Debt service 

requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and future revenues of the debt service fund. 

Capital leases are paid from the_General Fund and Capital Projects Fund.

The District participates in the state-administrated Teacher's Retirement System of O
klahoma (the 

"system"), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system. Th
e supervising 

authority for the management and operation of the System is a 13-member Board of Trustee
s, which acts 

as a fiduciary for investment of the funds and the application of plan interpretations. The Sy
stem provides 

retirement and disability benefits, annual cost of living adjustments, death benefits and oth
er benefits to 

plan members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statutes establish benefit provisions
 and may be 

amended only through legislative action. The District has no responsibility or authority for
 the operation 

and administration of the system nor has it any liability, except for contribution requi
rements. The 

Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that incl
udes financial 

statements and required supplementary information for the System. The report may be obtai
ned by writing 

to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 
73152. 

Basis of Accounting 

The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except 
for accruals of 

interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the con
tributions are 

made. Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a
 standardized 

disclosed measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation metho
d reflects the 

present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result
 of employee 

services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. 
There are no 

actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an under-fu
nded pension 

benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 

Funding Policy 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. Th
e contribution 

rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklah
oma Statutes. 

The rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee's earnings p
lus employer-

paid fringe benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of c
ompensation. 

Additionally, OTRS receives "federal matching contributions" for positions whose funding
 comes from 

federal sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14.0%
 of applicable 

compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from
 3.54% of its 

revenues from sales tax use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes.
 The District 

contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma plus the federal contribution contributed the re
maining 4.5% 

during this year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System
 to make the 

required contributions on behalf of the participating members. The school is required to pay 
16.5% for any 

compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits.

5. Litigation 

The District is contingently liable for lawsuits and other claims in the ordinary course of its operations. The 

settlement of such contingencies under the budgetary process would require appropriation of revenues yet 

to be realized, and would not materially affect the financial position of the District at June 30, 2018. 

6. Related Entities 

The following entities are separately constituted and, accordingly, their financial position and results of 

operations have not been presented in the accompanying financial statements. Officers are not appointed

OHS Tip-In Basketball Booster Club 
Winner's Circle Booster Club 
OHS Swim Booster Club 
OHS Soccer Booster Association 
OHS Music Parent Association 
Duncan Public School's Foundation 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 

assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial 

insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials 

liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in 

any of the past three fiscal years. 

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is transfer 

or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASS No. 10, the School 

reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the 

Oklahoma School Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' 

compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. In that capacity, OSAG is 

responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract 

arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for 

any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is required 

to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the. 

District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses 

based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund, 

so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use 

their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest. 

The District participates in the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation Account under the 

sponsorship of the Oklahoma State School Boards Association and the cooperative councilfor Oklahoma 

School Administration. The account was established to let school districts self-insure unemployment 

benefits for school employees. The funds are held in the name of each school district as reserves to pay 

unemployment claims. Each school district is individually liable for that portion of the benefits paid from the 

fund attributable to wages paid by the school district in the same manner as if no group account had been 

established. The reserve funds may be withdrawn from the account upon request of the school district. At 

June 30, 2018, the Duncan School District had reserves on deposit with the Oklahoma Public Schools 

Unemployment Compensation Accounting totaling $23, 123.51. This amount has not been included in the 

District's balance sheet at June 30, 2018.

DUNCAN SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-1 
STEPHENS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. For all federal programs, the District uses the fund types prescribed by the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 
Oklahoma. The General Fund is used to account for resources restricted, or designated for, 
specific purposes by a granter. Federal and state financial assistance generally is accounted for 
in the General Fund. 

2. The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its' 
measurement focus. The Governmental Fund types are accounted for using a current financial 
measurement focus. All federal grant funds were accounted for in the General Fund. With this 
measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities and the fund balance are included 
on the balance sheet. Operating statements of these funds present increases and decreases in 
net current assets. 

The Regulatory Basis of Accounting is used for the Governmental Fund types and Agency 
funds. This basis of accounting recognizes revenue from all sources when they are received. 
Federal grant funds are considered to be recognized when encumbered or reserved to the 
extent of expenditures made under the provisions of the grant. 

3. Positive amounts listed in the either "Balance at July 1, 2017" or "Balance at June 30, 2018" 
column represent funds received by the school and not yet expended or coded to the program. 
Negative amounts represent expenditures which have been claimed, but the revenue not yet 
collected. 

4. The District received donated foods through the Federal Food Distribution Program (10.555). At 
June 30, 2018, the school maintained an immaterial amount of food commodities inventory. Per 
the Regulatory Basis of Accounting, the commodities received and used are $89,947.11 not 
recognized as revenue or expenditures in the school's Financial Statements. 

5. The District has not elected to use the 10% de mini mus indirect cost rate allowed under the 
Uniform Guidance. 

6. Reconciliation of the Revenue shown on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards to 
Statement of Revenue, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balance is as follows: 

Revenue 

Total revenue per "Schedule of Expenditures 

of Federal Awards" $ 2,975,053.10 

Less Commodities (non-cash assistance) (89,947.11) 

Net Total $ 2,885, 105.99

REPORTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Duncan School District No. 1-1 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica and 
the standards applicable to financial audits ·contained in Government Auditing ·standards, issued by the 

Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-
regulatory basis within the combined financial statements of Duncan School District No. 1-1 , Stephens County, 
Oklahoma (District}, as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and 
have issued my report thereon dated January 7, 2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of 
the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and 
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, 
my report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account group with respect to the 
presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State 

Board of Education. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing my opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over financial repo'rting. Accordingly, I do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.· 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 

control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial 
statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a 

deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 

important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

·My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section 
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal 
control that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been 

identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of material 

misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and 
grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of 

financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 

objective of my audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no 
instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 

Standards. I noted certain immaterial instances of noncompliance that I have reported to management in the 

"Schedule of Comments" on page 39 of this report. 

Purpose of this Report 

This report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in 

considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 

other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; 

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF 

EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Duncan School District No. 1-1 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the compliance of Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County, Oklahoma (District's) 

compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget 

(OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the District's major 

federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the 

summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 

applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs based 

on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of compliance in 

accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; and the audit 

requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 

Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those 

standards and Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 

whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 

and material effect on a major program occurred. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence about 

the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as I consider 

necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance for each major federal 

program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance . 

. Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material respects, 

with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each 

of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

35 



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of Duncan School District No. 1-1, Stephens County, Oklahoma (District), is responsible for 

establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 

requirements referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District's 

internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on 

' each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 

the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 

internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an 

opinion on effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the 

effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 

compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 

functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 

program, on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or 

combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that 

material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or 

detected and corrected on, a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a 

deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 

requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over 

compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 

of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 

material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 

compliance that I considered to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have 

not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of 

internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Uniform Guidance. 

Accordingly, this re~ort1~~e for any other purpose.

JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018

DUNCAN SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-1 
STEPHENS COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

SCHEDULE OF COMMENTS 
JULY 1, 2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018 

The following conditions, while not representing material weaknesses in the system of internal accounting 
control, represent areas noted during my review of the school's accounting system in which I feel improvements 
in the internal control and/or operational efficiency may be attained. I have also noted, as required, any 
noncompliance with State Department of Education Regulations. 

*I. Condition: Our review of Activity Fund sponsor receipts indicated that monies collected are not always 
deposited with the site secretary in a timely manner. Approximately 30% of all Activity Fund source 
receipts tested were untimely. 

Recommendation: The School Board should ensure that all activity sub-account sponsors deposit 
monies by the end of the next business day, if collections exceed $100, or at least weekly if under $100 
with the Activity Fund Custodian and retain their copy of the receipt issued by the Custodian. 

II. Condition: The District has adopted an Activity Fund Profit and Loss Statement. This form is to be 
completed and turned into the site secretary. The District Activity Fund custodian collects all forms that are 
turned in and files in a binder by site. We were provided with the binder. We noted several fundraisers 
that were held by various District student organizations which did not have a P&L form completed and 
turned in. These included the Sr. Class t-shirt sale, Sophomore Class t-shirt sale, FFA plant sale, and the 
FFA clothing sale. 

Recommendation: The District should adopt procedures that require all sponsors conducting a fundraiser 
for a student organization to complete the District's Activity Fund Profit and Loss Statement. District 
officials at each site including the site secretary and principal should ensure a P&L form is completed for all 
fundraising events held, and also ensure that all forms are turned into the District Activity Fund Custodian 
at the administration building. 

Previous Year's Audit Comments 

Excluding the condition marked with an asterisk, there are no other items in the 2016-17 audit report, which 
have been repeated in this report. 

I would like to express my appreciation for the courtesies and cooperation extended to us by school district 

administrators and employees during the course of this audit.
