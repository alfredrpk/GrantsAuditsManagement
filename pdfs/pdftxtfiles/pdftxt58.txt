 INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Marlow School District No. I-003 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 
 
Board Members: 
 
Report on Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory 
basis of the Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s 
basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with the financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet 
financial reporting requirements of the State of Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory 
basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the financial statements in the 
circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal 
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.    In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
adverse and qualified audit opinions. 
 
 
 

 



2 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by Marlow School District No. I-003 
Stephens County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, to meet the requirements of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of 
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 
 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
 
In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the 
above paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, the financial position of Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, 
Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, or the changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows 
for the year then ended. 
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
 
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is a 
departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education.  The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset account group is not known. 
 
Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
 
In our opinion,  except for the effects of the matter described in the “Basis for Qualified Opinion on 
Regulatory Basis of Accounting” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities, and fund balance  arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of  Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, 
Oklahoma as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected, expenditures paid and encumbered, and 
budgetary results, for the year ended on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively 
comprise the Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s basic financial statements. 
The combining statements – regulatory basis, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a 
required part of the basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented 
for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is 
also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



3 

The combining statements-regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and 
other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.   Such information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America.  In our opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of 
federal awards are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a 
whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated September 13, 
2018, on our consideration of the Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s internal 
control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to 
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results 
of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Marlow School District No. I-003, 
Stephens County, Oklahoma’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an 
integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standard in considering 
Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s internal control over financial reporting 
and compliance.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
The basic financial statements of the Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma 
(the “District”) have been prepared in conformity with another comprehensive basis of accounting as 
prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The more significant of the District’s 
accounting policies are described below. 

 

1.A. Reporting Entity 
 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes 
and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. 
 
 The District is part of the public-school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control 
of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma support.  The 
general operating authority for the public-school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in 
Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members.  The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 
 
In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered 
all potential component units.  The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting 
entity was made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB).   The basic, but not the only, criterion for including a potential component unit within the 
reporting entity is the governing body’s ability to exercise oversight responsibility.  The most 
significant manifestation of this ability is financial interdependency.  Other manifestations of the 
ability to exercise oversight responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing 
authority, the designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations, and 
accountability for fiscal matters.  A second criterion used in evaluating potential component units is 
the scope of public service.  Application of this criterion involves considering whether the activity 
benefits the District and /or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted within the geographic 
boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons.  A third criterion used to evaluate 
potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of 
special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight 
responsibilities.  Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units 
included in the District’s reporting entity.  The District has various supporting groups.  However, the 
District does not appoint any of the board members or exercise any oversight authority over these 
groups and the dollar amounts are not material to the District. 

 

1.B.  Fund Accounting 
 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its 
operations.  Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial 
management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities. 
 
A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  An account group, on the 
other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets and 
liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable 
available financial resources. 
 
Funds are classified into two categories: governmental and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided 
into separate "fund types."

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued) 

 
1.B.  Fund Accounting, (continued) 

 
Governmental Fund Types 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing of 
general long-term debt (debt service funds). 

 
 1.  General Fund - The General Fund is used to account for all financial transactions except 
those required to be accounted for in another fund.  Major revenues sources include state and local 
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures 
include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for programs funded for 
building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and other long-

term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for 
specific programs. 
 
2.  Special Revenue Funds - The Special Revenue Funds of the District consist of the Building 
Fund and Child Nutrition Fund. 
 

Building Fund - The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for 
the purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and 
equipment. 

 
Child Nutrition Fund - The Child Nutrition Fund consists of monies collected from meals 
served to students and employees of the District and is expended on food, supplies and 
salaries to operate the lunchroom.  The District also deposits reimbursements received from 
the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs into this fund. 
 

3.  Debt Service Fund - The Debt Service Fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to 
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt 
principal, interest and related costs.  The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied 
specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 
 
4. Capital Projects Fund - The Capital Projects Fund consists of the District’s 2018 Building 
Bond issue.  These funds are used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and 
equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities and acquiring transportation 
equipment. 
 

Fiduciary Fund Types 
 

Fiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other 
governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District.  When these assets are held under the 
terms of a formal trust agreement, trust funds are used for their accounting and reporting.   Agency 
funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their 
agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued) 
 

1.B.  Fund Accounting, (continued) 
 

1.  Agency Funds - The Agency Fund is the School Activities fund, which is used to account for 
monies, collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored 
groups.  The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, 
disbursing and accounting for these activity funds. 

 
Account Groups 
 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish 
accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets not accounted for in proprietary 
funds. 

 
1. General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group is used to account for all 
long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund 
and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal.  It 
is also used to account for liabilities for compensated absences and early retirement incentives, 
which are to be paid from funds provided in future years. 
 
2. General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, 
plant and equipment of the District.  The District does not have the information necessary to 
include this group in its combined financial statements. 
 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 
 

The total column on the general-purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to 
indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis.  Data in this column does not 
present financial position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles.  Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation.  Interfund eliminations 
have not been made in the aggregation of this data. 
 

1.C.  Basis of Accounting and Presentation 
 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education.  This format is essentially the generally accepted form of 
presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB 34, Basic 
Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. This 
format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 
 
The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements 
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as 
follows: 
 
• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the

1.C.  Basis of Accounting and Presentation, (continued) 
 

• Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the obligation is 
incurred. 

 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available and 
measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related 
liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned and liabilities are 
incurred for trust funds. 

 
1.D.  Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 
 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.   The board of education requests an 
initial temporary appropriations budget from the county excise board before June 30.  Then no later 
than October 1, the board of education prepares financial statement and estimate of needs and files it 
with the applicable county clerk and the State Department of Education.  The final budget may be 
revised upon approval of the board of education and the county excise board. 
 
Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal budget is required for all funds except for trust and agency 
funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved budgeted 
appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for supplemental 
appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. 
 

1.E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity 
 

Cash and Cash Equivalents – The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits, and highly 
liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased, to be cash and 
cash equivalents. 
 
Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States government and agencies 
with maturities greater than three months when purchased.   All investments are recorded at cost, 
which approximates market value. 
 
Property Tax Revenues – The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist 
of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District.  The County Assessor, upon 
receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax 
roll for submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1.  The county treasurer must commence 
tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls.  The first half of taxes are due prior to 
January 1.  The second half is due prior to April 1.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued) 

 

1.E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity, (continued) 
 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2.  Second 
half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment.  If not paid by 
the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due.  The owner has 
two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  If at the end of two years the 
owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property. 
 
Inventories – The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018, is not material to the basic 
financial statements. 
 
Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment - The General Fixed Asset Account Group has not 
been presented. 
 
Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated with 
expendable available financial resources is reported as an expenditure and a fund liability of the 
governmental fund that will pay it.  There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation leave that 
are not expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources. 
 
No liability is recorded for nonvesting accumulating rights to receive sick pay benefits.  Vested 
accumulated rights to receive sick pay benefits have not been reported in the general long-term debt 
account group since the amount is not material to the financial statements. 
 
Long-Term Debt – Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due or 
when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following 
year.  For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable 
available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund.  The remaining 
portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term debt account group. 
 
Fund Balance - In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund 

balances.  The hierarchy is based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed upon use of 

resources for specific purposes versus availability of appropriation.  An important distinction that is 

made in reporting fund balance is between amounts that are considered nonspendable (i.e., fund 

balance associated with assets that are not in spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid items, 

long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or items that are legally required to be maintained 

intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund) and those that are spendable (such as fund balance 

associated with cash, investments or receivables). 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, 

assigned or unassigned, as appropriate. 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors 

(such as debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments; or 

by law, through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued) 

 

1.E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity, (continued) 
 

Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific purposes by 

formal action of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority.  Such amounts are 

not subject to legal enforceability (like restricted amounts), but cannot be used for any other 

purpose unless the government removes or changes the limitation by taking action similar to that 

which imposed the commitment. 

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes, but 

are neither restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a 

subordinated high-level body or official who the governing body has delegated the authority to 

assign amounts to be used for specific purposes.  Assigned fund balances includes all remaining 

spendable amounts (except negative balances) that are reported in governmental funds other than 

the general fund, that are neither restricted nor committed, and amounts in the general fund that 

are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance with the provisions of the standard. 

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund.  It represents the 

amounts that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, 

committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the general fund. 

Resource Use Policy 

It is the District’s policy for all funds that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes 

for which both restricted and unrestricted resources, including fund balances, are available, the 

District considers restricted amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used. 

Furthermore, it is the District’s policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes 

for which committed, assigned, or unassigned resources, including fund balances, are available, 

the School considers committed amounts to be spent first, followed by assigned amounts and 

lastly unassigned amounts 

1.F.  Revenue, Expenses, and Expenditures 
 

State Sources - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state 
aid formula under provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board of 
Education administers the allocation of the state aid funds to school districts based on information 
accumulated from the districts. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of 
Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by 
review.  Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when 
the adjustment is made.

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued) 

 

1.F.  Revenue, Expenses, and Expenditures, (continued) 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical education programs.  The 
State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only 
for the program for which the money is provided.  These rules also require that the money not 
expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended 
for the same categorical programs.  The State Department of Education requires that categorical 
educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 
 
Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or 
expenses.  Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially 
made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the 
fund that is reimbursed. 
 
All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are reported 
as transfers.   Transfers in/transfers out may not agree because activity fund transactions are not 
included.

Custodial Credit Risk – Exposure to custodial credit related to deposits exists when the District holds 
deposits that are uninsured and uncollateralized; collateralized with securities held by the pledging 
financial institution, or by its trust department or agent but not in the District’s name; or collateralized 
without a written or approved collateral agreement.  Exposure to custodial credit risk related to 
investments exists when the District holds investments that are uninsured and unregistered, with 
securities held by the counterparty or by its trust department or agent but not in the District’s name.

Note 2 – Deposit and Investment Risk, (continued) 
 
The District’s policy as it relates to custodial credit risk is to secure its uninsured deposits with 
collateral, valued at no more than market value, at least at a level of 100 percent of the uninsured 
deposits and accrued interest thereon.  The investment policy and state law also limit acceptable 
collateral to U.S. Treasury and agency securities and direct debt obligations of the state, municipalities, 
counties, and school districts in the state of Oklahoma, surety bonds, and letters of credit.  As required 
by Federal 12 U.S.C.A., Section 1823(e), all financial institutions pledging collateral to the District must 
have a written collateral agreement approved by the board of directors or loan committee. 

 
The District did not have any custodian credit risk as of June 30, 2018 as defined above. 
 
Investment Credit Risk – The District has no investment policy that limits its investment choices other 
than the limitations of state law that generally authorize investment in: 
 
1. Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities to which the full faith 

and credit of the U.S. Government is pledged, or obligations to the payment of which the full faith 
and credit of the State is pledged. 

2. Certificates of deposit of banks when such certificates of deposits are secured by acceptable 
collateral for the deposit of public monies. 

3. Savings accounts or saving certificates to the extent that such accounts or certificates are fully 
insured             by the United States Government. 

4. Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral including obligations of the United States 
government, its agencies and instrumentalities, or the State of Oklahoma. 

5. County, municipal or school district debt obligations for which an ad valorem tax may be levied. 
6. Money market funds regulated by the SEC and in which investments consist of obligations of the 

United States, its agencies and instrumentalities. 
7. Warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district. 
8. Qualified pooled investment programs through an interlocal cooperative agreement formed pursuant 

to applicable law and to which the board of education has voted to be a member, the investments of 
which consist of those items specified in paragraphs 1 through 7 above, as well as obligations of the 
United States agencies and instrumentalities. 

9.  Any other investment that is authorized by law. 
 
Investment credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its 
obligation.  The District has no formal policy limiting investments based on credit rating, but discloses 
any such credit risk associated with their investment by reporting the credit quality ratings of investment 
in debt securities as determined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations-rating agencies- 
as of the year end.  Unless there is information to the contrary, obligations of the U.S. government or 
obligations explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government are not considered to have credit risk and do 
not require disclosure of credit quality. 
 
The District did not have any investment credit risk as of June 30, 2018, as defined above. 
 
Investment Interest Rate Risk – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely 
affect the fair value of an investment.  The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits 
investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing 
interest rates.  The District discloses it exposure to interest rate risk by disclosing the maturity dates of 
its various investments.  The District had no investment interest rate risk as defined above.

Note 2 – Deposit and Investment Risk, (continued) 

 
Concentration of Investment Credit Risk – Exposure to concentration of credit risk is considered to 
exist when investments in any one issuer represent a significant percent of total investments of the 
District (any over 5 percent are disclosed).  Investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. 
government and investments in mutual funds, external investment pools, and other pooled investments 
are excluded from this consideration.   The District places no limit on the amount it may invest in any 
one issuer. 
 
At June 30, 2018, the District had no concentration of credit risk as defined above. 

 

Note 3 - General Long-Term Debt 
 

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be 
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters.   Bond issues have been 
approved by the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements and transportation 
purposes.  These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. 
 
General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable and lease purchases.   Debt service 
requirements for bonds are payable solely from the fund balance and future revenues of the debt 
service fund. 
 
The following is a summary of the long-term debt transactions of the District for the year ended June 
30, 2018:

 Interest paid on general debt during the 2017-18 year was $31,482.50. 
 
The District has entered into various lease agreements as lessee for financing the acquisition of copiers 
and  the building project.  The lease agreements qualify as a capital leases for accounting purposes 
since title transfers at the end of the lease terms and they have been recorded at the present value of 
the future minimum lease payments.  The leases contain a clause which gives the District the ability to 
terminate the lease agreements at the end of each fiscal year. 

 
 As noted in Note 1 to the financial statements, the District does not record fixed assets in the financial 
statements.  Consistent with this, the District has not recorded the above assets as assets in the General 
fixed assets account group.  The District has recorded the liability for future lease payments in the 
general long-term debt account group for the above leases.  The schedule of future minimum lease 
payments under the capital lease and the present value of the net minimum lease payments at June 30, 
is as follows:

Note 4 - Employee Retirement System 

 
Plan Description - The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement 
System (the “System”) which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit Public Employee 
Retirement System (PERS).  The administration, benefits, and funding of the System are governed by 
Article XVII, Section 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes.  The System is administered by a board of trustees 
which acts as a fiduciary for investing the funds and governing the administration of the System. PERS 
provides retirement, disability and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries.   The District has 
no responsibility or authority for the operation and administration of the System nor has it any 
liability, except for the current contribution requirements. 
 
The System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required 
supplementary information that can be obtained in writing at the Teachers’ Retirement System of 
Oklahoma, P.O. Box 53524, Oklahoma City, Ok 73152 or by calling (405) 521-2387. 
 
Funding Policy -   Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, 
and the participating employees.  Participation is required for all teachers and other certified 
employees and is optional for all other regular employees of public education institutions who work at 
least 20 hours per week. 

 
The contribution rates for the District and its employees, which are not actuarially determined, are 
established by statute and applied to the employee’s earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  The 
District is required by statute to contribute 9.50% applicable compensation for the year ended June 30, 
2018.  The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System to make the required 
contributions on behalf of the participating members.  The required contribution for participating 
members is 7%. 
 
The District’s contributions to the System for the years ending June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were 
$536,619.36,  $526,246, and $540,968  respectively. 
 
The compensation for employees covered by the System for the year ended June 30, 2018 was 
$5,521,396; the District’s total compensation was $6,809,529.   In addition to the District’s 9.50% 
contributions, the District was required to pay into the System 7.80% of compensation arising from 
federal grants $39,446.87.  There were $374,413 contributions made by employees during the year 
ended June 30, 2018. 
 
The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension 
benefits.  This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension benefits that 
will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the 
effect of projected salary increases.  There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school 
districts.  The nonfunded pension benefit obligation of the System as determined as part of the latest 
actuarial valuation dated June 30, 2017, is as follows: 
 
 Total pension obligation                                   $   22,054,148,050 
 Net assets available for benefits, at cost              15,516,340,027 
 
 Nonfunded pension benefit obligation               $     6,637,808,023 
 
The System’s accounting records are maintained on the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals 
of interest income.

Note 4 - Employee Retirement System, (continued) 
 
Ten-year historical trend information is presented in the Teacher’s Retirement System of Oklahoma 
Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2017.  This information is useful in assessing the pension 
plan’s accumulation of sufficient assets to pay pension benefits as they come due. 

 
Note 5 - Contingencies 
 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor 
agencies.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the 
applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot 
be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 

 
Note 6 – Risk Management 
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God.  The District purchases 
commercial insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and 
public official’s liability.  The District had the following insurance coverage during the year: 
Commercial property - $44,799,362; general liability - $1,000,000; and educator’s liability 
$1,000,000.  Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance 
coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 
 
The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers’ Compensation coverage in which there is a 
transfer or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool.  In accordance with GASB No. 10, the 
school reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense.  The risk 
pool is the Oklahoma School Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of 
providing workers’ compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma.  In that 
capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, 
including obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims 
processing, and legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year.  As a 
member of OSAG the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established 
payment schedule.  A portion of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District.  The 
fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based on the school’s losses for the last five 
years.  OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the District’s liability for claim loss in 
limited to the balance of the loss fund.  If the District does not use their loss fund in three years it is 
returned to them with no interest. 

Note 7 - Use of Estimates 
 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting requires 
the District to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ 
from those estimates.

Notes to the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards 

For the Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 
 

Note 1 – Basis of Presentation – The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards (the 
Schedule) includes the federal award activity of the School under programs of the federal government for 
the year ended June 30, 2018.  The information in this Schedule is presented in accordance with the 
requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, 
Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Because the Schedule 
presents only a selected portion of the operations of the School, it is not intended and does not present the 
financial position, changes in net position or cash flows of the School. 
 
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Expenditures reported on the Schedule are 
reported on the regulatory basis of accounting consistent with the preparation of the combined financial 
statements except for nonmonetary assistance noted in Note 3.  Such expenditures are recognized following 
the cost principles contained in the Uniform Guidance, wherein certain types of expenditures are not 
allowable or are limited as to reimbursement.  The School has elected not to use the 10 percent de minimus 
indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance. 
 
Note 3 – Food Distribution – Non-monetary assistance is reported in the Schedule at the fair market value 
of the commodities received and disbursed. 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 



Exhibit C-1 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
 
 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Marlow School District No. I-003 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 
 
 
Board Members: 
 
 
We have audited,  in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America 
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States of America, the accompanying fund type and account group 
financial statements-regulatory basis, within the combined financial statements of Marlow  School District 
No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to 
the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial statements and have issued our 
report thereon dated September 13, 2018.  The report on these financial statements was adverse with 
respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of 
accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  However, our report was qualified for the omission of the 
general fixed asset account group with respect to the presentation of financial statements on the regulatory 
basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. 
 
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Marlow School District 
No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s, internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to 
determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our 
opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the District’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
District’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination 
of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of 
the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis.   A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe 
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 



Exhibit C-2 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may 
exist that were not identified.  Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies 
in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  We did identify certain deficiencies in 
internal control, described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs that we consider 
to be significant deficiencies.  (2018-001, 2018-002). 
 
Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The 
results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported 
under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s, Response to Findings 
 
Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s response to the findings identified in our 
audit are described in the attached corrective action plan.  The District’s response was not subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion 
on it. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance.  This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 

PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE 
REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Marlow School District No. I-003 
Stephens County, Oklahoma 
 
Board Members: 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma’s, compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct 
and material effect on each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The 
District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Marlow School District, No. I-003 
Stephens County, Oklahoma’s, major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and 
the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Those 
standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that 
could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those requirements and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
 
 We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, Marlow School District No. I-003, Stephens County, Oklahoma complied, in all material 
respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 



Exhibit D-2 

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
 
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.   A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform 
Guidance.    Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

be required on all salaries funded from revenues other than funds generated from local taxes or revenues originating 
from the State of Oklahoma. No later than April 1, 2001, and each April 1 thereafter, the Board of Trustees of the 
Teachers' Retirement System shall set the contribution rate to be paid by employers. The contribution rate shall be 
determined using cost principles established by federal regulations and shall be consistent with generally accepted 
accounting principles. “ 
 
Cause/Effect of Condition - The District reclassified salaries and did not recalculate teachers retirement on the 
reclassified salaries.  Teacher’s retirement was underpaid. 
 
Recommendation – The District should contact teacher retirement to discuss how to remit the underpaid amounts. 
 
2018-002 – Statement of Condition – During our testing of payroll, we noticed timesheets were not being kept by 
all employees that would be considered non-exempt by the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Also, we noted a few 
timesheets that were not signed by the supervisor. 
 
Criteria –The Fair Labor Standards Act requires accurate time records be maintained by all non-exempt employee. 
 
Cause/Effect of Condition - Oversight by the District.  Some employees are preparing timesheets, but not everyone 
that would be considered non-exempt is preparing timesheets.  Employees could be overpaid or underpaid 

 
Recommendation – Timesheets should be completed by all non-exempt employees.  The supervisor should review 
timesheets before they approve them to ensure they are accurate.

Findings-Financial Statement Audit 
2017-001 – Statement of Condition - The Superintendent was paid a stipend that was not included in his 
contract.  The board approved stipends for all staff, but the amount approved was not in the minutes. 
 
Criteria - The superintendent cannot be paid more than the amount listed on the contract filed with the 
State Department of Education.  All salaries are required to be approved by the board. 
 
Cause/Effect of Condition -Staff was not aware that the superintendent’s contract needed to be amended. 
The superintendent was paid more than the amount on his contract on file at the State Department of 
Education. 
 
Recommendation - We recommend all wages paid to superintendent be included on his contract and the 
amount of the stipend should be approved in the minutes. 
 
Current Status -  This was not noted for the 2017-18 year. 
 
2017-002 – Statement of Condition – The District did not pay federal matching teacher retirement on 
salaries charged to Indian Education (project 561).  We estimate underpayment of the federal matching to 
be approximately $2,094. 
 
Criteria – The teacher retirement system requires the school to pay a 7.7% matching contribution on 
salaries paid with federal funds. 
 
Cause/Effect of Condition - The District did not have the federal project code set up to withhold the 
proper amount of federal matching teacher retirement.  Teacher’s retirement was underpaid. 
 
Recommendation - The District should contact teacher retirement to discuss how to remit the underpaid 
amounts.  In addition, the District needs to make sure its software is set up correctly to properly withhold 
teacher retirement in the future. 
 
Current Status – Teacher retirement match was paid corrected for the 2017-18 year.
