INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 

Board of Regents 

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 

Langston University 

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 

 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Langston University (the University), an 

organizational unit of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (the 

Regents), which is a component unit of the State of Oklahoma, and its discretely presented component unit, as of 

and for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related notes to the financial statements, which 

collectively comprise the University’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 

with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 

implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial 

statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our 

audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 

applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of 

the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 

about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. The financial statements of the 

Foundation were not audited in accordance with Governmental Auditing Standards. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 

financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the 

risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 

assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 

financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 

purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no 

such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 

reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 

presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 

opinions.

Opinions 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 

financial position of the University and its discretely presented component unit as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and 

the respective changes in financial position, and where applicable, cash flows thereof for the years then ended in 

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2018 the University adopted new accounting guidance, 

GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 

Pensions. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Emphasis of Matter 

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of the University are intended to present the financial position, 

the changes in financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows of only that portion of the Regents that is 

attributable to the transactions of the University. They do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial 

position of the Regents as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, 

its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 

States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 

discussion and analysis and the schedules related to other postemployment benefits and pension liabilities and 

contributions, as listed in the table of contents, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such 

information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting 

Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial 

statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited 

procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in 

the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the 

information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the 

basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. 

We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not 

provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

 



 

 
 

 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 31, 2018, on 

our consideration of the University’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance 

with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of 

that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and 

the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or on 

compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing 

Standards in considering the University’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
LANGSTON UNIVERSITY 
An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the  
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 
 
For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
The following discussion and analysis of the financial performance of Langston University (the 
“University”) provides an overview of the University’s financial activities for the fiscal years ended 
June 30, 2018 and 2017.  This analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant financial 
activities and information and should be read in conjunction with the University’s financial statements. 
 
Effective July 1, 2017, the University implemented a new accounting standard, GASB Statement 
No.75, as described in Note 1 to the accompanying financial statements. This new standard required 
the University to report liabilities associated with its other post-employment benefits (OPEB) that 
had previously not been recognized. As a result, the University has reduced its opening net position 
as of July 1, 2017. Amounts for 2017 have not been restated, but are presented as originally reported, 
because to do so was not practical. 
 
FINANCIAL SUMMARY 
 
• The University’s net position and changes in net position for FY 2018 as compared to FY 2017 and 

2016 was impacted by significant decreases in the capital lease obligations and requirements to 
recognize the University’s share of the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System pension liability.  
The market appreciation of the endowment produced a $2.4 million increase in non-current 
assets, while a pension obligation of $32.3 million was recognized as of June 30, 2018 reflecting a 
decrease of approximately $10.2 million in long-term debt.  Deferred outflows of resources related 
to the pension and OPEB obligation were recognized in the amount of $7 million.  Additionally, 
deferred inflows of resources related to the pension and OPEB obligations were also recorded in 
the amount of $5.8 million, pensions specifically, reflecting differences between projected and 
actual earnings on pension plan investments, and differences between expected and actual 
experience.   

The resulting net position for the University amounted to $74.8 million, $75 million and $73.7 
million at June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.    

• Total revenues for fiscal years ending June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $70.9 million, 
$72.4 million and $74.8 million, respectively.  Nonoperating revenues decreased by $1.6 million, 
reflecting decreases in state appropriations and gains on endowment investments. 

• Total expenses amounted to $68.5 million, $70.9 million and $65 million for the fiscal years ending 
June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Operating expenses decreased during fiscal year 2018 
by $2.5 million reflecting a decrease primarily in contractual services as well as in employee 
compensation and benefits resulting from the recording of deferred pension inflows and outflows 
and related amortization.

FY 2018 vs. FY 2017 

Total assets increased $2.0 million during FY 2018.  Market appreciation in the endowment and 
increased grants receivables were offset by increased depreciation in capital assets.        
 
Deferred outflows of resources decreased by $5.4 million primarily due to a change in assumptions 
and the net difference between projected and actual earnings on pension and OPEB plan 
investments.  
 
Total liabilities decreased $7.8 million compared to the previous year, reflecting primarily the 
decrease in pension liabilities.  Decreases of its $42.5 million share of the Oklahoma Teacher’s

lease obligations of approximately $3.7 million.

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 
 
For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF NET POSITION--Continued 
 
Deferred Inflows of Resources increased $4.6 million due to the change in pension and OPEB liability 
from recognition of deferred inflows relating to the difference between projected and actual earnings 
on pension plan investments, as well as differences between expected and actual experience.   
 
Net position decreased from $75 million at June 30, 2017 to $74.8 million at June 30, 2018 primarily 
due to the restatement to beginning net position from the implementation of GASB 75.  The increases 
were reflected in net investment in capital assets, the market appreciation of the endowment and 
unrestricted net position due to the reduction on the OTRS net pension liability.   
 

FY 2017 vs. FY 2016 

Total assets decreased $2.0 million during FY 2017.  Market appreciation in the endowment was 
offset by increased depreciation in capital assets.        
 
Deferred outflows of resources increased by $8.8 million primarily due to a change in assumptions 
and the net difference between projected and actual earnings on pension plan investments.  
 
Total liabilities increased $7.7 million compared to the previous year, reflecting the increase in 
pension liabilities.  Increases of its $42.5 million share of the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System 
pension liability were offset by decreases in capital lease obligations.   
 
Deferred Inflows of Resources decreased $2.2 million due to the change in pension liability from 
recognition of deferred inflows relating to the difference between projected and actual earnings on 
pension plan investments, as well as differences between expected and actual experience.   
 
Net position increased from $73.7 million at June 30, 2016 to $75 million at June 30, 2017.  The 
increases were reflected in net investment in capital assets with the completion of the goat research 
barn and the market appreciation of the endowment.

Operating revenues increased $35 thousand which is primarily related to increased tuition and fees 
and meal plan revenues offset by decreases in grants and contracts and housing revenues.  That 
slight increase was then offset by the decreases in state appropriations and gains on endowment 
investments revenue.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
LANGSTON UNIVERSITY 
An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the  
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 
 
For the Years Ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE UNIVERSITY’S FUTURE 
 
Enrollment trends at Langston University are showing a slow and steady increase. The freshmen 
class that enrolled in the fall of 2018 was the second largest class in the last 5 years at the 
institution.  Greater emphasis has been placed on recruiting rural Oklahoma and the surrounding 
states. Furthermore, the institution has partnered with a national institute to increase the number of 
transfer students that enroll and graduate from our urban campuses in Oklahoma City and Tulsa.  
 
Compensation and benefit costs are anticipated to remain relatively flat in FY 2019.  However, the 
University did institute a $1,200 pay increase for all full-time regular employees for FY19.  This total 
increase in compensation expense for these respective pay increases is approximately $372,000. 
 
State appropriations have been declining for the last few years. Current Oklahoma revenues are 
below budgeted levels, which are significantly influenced by energy prices.  This continuing 
condition could result in a significant reduction during FY 2018 and/or FY 2019.  Increases in state 
funding are needed in order maintain and improve the quality of the students’ educational 
experience, without adding substantial student debt, as well as to address the increasing enrollment 
each year.  It is always the University’s intent to keep student fees as affordable as possible, while 
balancing the needs of the University.  The University continues to be the low cost provider of 
quality four-year education in the State of Oklahoma.  It is the University’s expectation to continue 
to make the University an affordable option for its students.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Nature of operations: Langston University (the “University”) is a baccalaureate degree granting institution 
established by an act of the Territorial Legislature in 1897. The University’s mission is to provide higher 
education primarily for the people of Oklahoma through academic programs, cultural enrichment, lifelong 
learning experiences and public service activities. The University is under the governance of the Board of 
Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (Regents). 
 
Reporting Entity: The University is one of five institutions of higher education in Oklahoma that comprise 
part of the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges, which in turn is part of the Higher Education 
component unit of the State of Oklahoma. 
 
The Board of Regents has constitutional authority to govern, control and manage the Oklahoma Agricultural 
and Mechanical Colleges, which consist of five institutions. This authority includes but is not limited to the 
power to designate management, the ability to significantly influence operations, acquire and take title to 
real and personal property in its name, appoint or hire all necessary officers, supervisors, instructors, and 
employees for member institutions. 
 
Accordingly, the University is considered an organizational unit of the Oklahoma Agricultural and 
Mechanical Colleges reporting entity for financial reporting purposes due to the significance of its legal, 
operational, and financial relationships with the Board of Regents as defined in Section 2100 of the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification of Governmental Accounting and 
Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
Langston University Foundation: Langston University Foundation (the “Foundation”), is a legally 
separate, Oklahoma not-for-profit corporation organized for the purpose of receiving and administering gifts 
intended for the University. Because the restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, 
or for the benefit of, the University, the University’s management believes that presenting the Foundation’s 
financial statements as part of the University reporting entity provides users relevant and timely information 
about resources available to the University. The Foundation has a June 30th year end and reports under 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). As such, certain 
revenue recognition criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria 
and presentation features. No modifications have been made to the Foundation’s financial information for 
these differences. The Foundation prepares separate, stand-alone financial statements which may be 
obtained by contacting the Foundation’s management. 
 
Financial statement presentation: The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the 
recognized standard setting body for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America (U.S. GAAP) applicable to public sector institutions of higher education. The University applies all 
applicable GASB pronouncements. 
 
Basis of accounting: For financial reporting purposes, the University is considered a special-purpose 
government engaged only in business-type activities. Accordingly, the University’s financial statements 
have been presented using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of 
accounting. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded 
when an obligation has been incurred. All significant intra-agency transactions have been eliminated.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Cash equivalents: For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the University considers all highly-liquid 
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Funds invested through 
the State Treasurer’s Cash Management Program are considered cash equivalents. 
 
Investments: The University accounts for its investments at fair value based on quoted market prices. 
Changes in the fair value of investments are reported as a component of investment income in the 
statement of revenues, expenses and changes in net position. 
 
Accounts receivable: Accounts receivable consist of tuition and fee charges to students and to auxiliary 
enterprise services provided to students, faculty and staff. Student accounts receivable are carried at the 
unpaid balance of the original amount billed to students and student loans receivable are carried at the 
amount of unpaid principal. Both receivables are less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based on a 
review of all outstanding amounts. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by 
identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. 
 
Student accounts and loans receivable are written off for financial reporting purposes when deemed 
uncollectible. Recoveries of student accounts and loans receivable previously written off are recorded when 
received. A student account receivable and student loan receivable is considered to be past due if any 
portion of the balance is outstanding after the end of the semester. Interest and late charges are not 
generally assessed and, if they are assessed, are not included in income or trade accounts receivable. 
 
Accounts receivable also include amounts due from federal, state and local governments, or private 
sources, in connection with reimbursement of allowable expenditures made pursuant to the University’s 
grants and contracts. Accounts receivable also include the distribution from the OSRHE endowment trust 
fund and amounts due from the Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority (OCIA) for proceeds from the 
capital bond improvement program allocated to the University. 
 
Restricted cash and investments: Cash and investments that are externally restricted to make debt 
service payments, maintain sinking or reserve funds, make long-term student loans, or to purchase capital 
or other noncurrent assets, are classified as restricted assets in the statements of net position. Restricted 
cash also includes assets whose use is limited and are set aside, as required by the LLC’s bond indentures, 
for future payments of principal, interest, property repairs, or other required purposes. 
 
Capital assets: Capital assets are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition, or fair value at the date of 
donation in the case of gifts. For equipment, the University’s capitalization policy includes all items with a 
unit cost of $5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater than one year. Renovations to buildings, 
infrastructure, and land improvements that significantly increase the value or extend the useful life of the 
structure are capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year 
which the expense was incurred. 
 
Costs incurred during construction of long-lived assets are recorded as construction in progress and are 
not depreciated until placed in service.  
 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 
generally 20 to 40 years for buildings, infrastructure and land improvements and 5 to 15 years for library 
materials and equipment.  Half year convention is used for the year of acquisition and disposal.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Unearned revenues: Unearned revenues include amounts received for tuition and fees and certain 
auxiliary activities prior to the end of the fiscal year but related to the subsequent accounting period. 
Unearned revenues also include amounts received from grant and contract sponsors that have not yet been 
earned. 
 
Compensated absences: Employee vacation pay is accrued at year-end for financial statement purposes. 
The liability and expense incurred are recorded at year-end as accrued compensated absences in the 
statements of net position, and as a component of compensation and benefit expense in the statements of 
revenues, expenses and changes in net position. 
 
Noncurrent liabilities: Noncurrent liabilities include (1) principal amounts of revenue bonds payable, notes 
payable, and capital lease obligations with contractual maturities greater than one year, and (2) estimated 
amounts for accrued compensated absences and other liabilities that will not be paid within the next fiscal 
year. 
 
Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures; accordingly, actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
 
Net position: The University’s net position is classified as follows: 
 
Net investment in capital assets: The net investment in capital assets component of net position consists 
of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of bonds, notes or 
other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. 
Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or improvement of those assets or related debt are also included in this component of net 
position. To the extent debt has been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not 
included as a component of net investment in capital assets. 
 
Restricted net position - expendable: Restricted expendable net position include resources in which the 
University is legally or contractually obligated to spend resources in accordance with restrictions imposed 
by external third parties. 
 
Restricted net position - nonexpendable: Restricted nonexpendable net position consist of endowment and 
similar type funds in which donors or other outside sources have stipulated, as a condition of the gift 
instrument, that the principal is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity, and invested for the purpose 
of producing present and future income, which may either be expended or added to principal. 
 
Unrestricted net position: Unrestricted net position represent resources derived from student tuition and 
fees, state appropriations and sales and services of educational departments, auxiliary enterprises and 
indirect costs from grants and contracts. These resources are used for transactions relating to the 
educational and general operations of the University, and may be used at the discretion of the governing 
board to meet current expenses for any purpose. These resources also include auxiliary enterprises, which 
are substantially self-supporting activities that provide services for students, faculty and staff. 
 
When an expense is incurred that can be paid using either restricted or unrestricted resources, the 
University’s policy is to first apply the expense towards restricted resources, and then towards unrestricted 
resources.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Income taxes: As a state institution of higher education the income of the University is generally exempt 
from federal income taxes under Section 115(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. However, the 
University may be subject to income taxes on unrelated business income under Internal Revenue Code 
Section 511(a)(2)(B). Such amounts have historically been insignificant. 
 
Classification of revenues: The University has classified its revenues as either operating or nonoperating 
revenues according to the following criteria: 
 
Operating revenues: Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange 
transactions, such as (1) student tuition and fees, net of scholarship discounts and allowances, (2) sales 
and services of auxiliary enterprises, net of scholarship discounts and allowances, (3) most federal, state 
and local grants and contracts and (4) interest on institutional student loans. 
 
Nonoperating revenues: Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of 
nonexchange transactions, such as gifts and contributions, student aid revenue and other revenue sources 
that are defined as nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement No. 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary 
and Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Governmental Entities That Use Proprietary Fund Accounting, and 
GASB Statement No. 34, such as state appropriations and investment income. 
 
Scholarship discounts and allowances: Student tuition and fee revenues, and certain other revenues 
from students, are reported net of scholarship discounts and allowances in the statements of revenues, 
expenses and changes in net position. Scholarship discounts and allowances are the differences between 
the stated charge for goods and services provided by the University, and the amount that is paid by students 
and/or third parties making payments on the students’ behalf. Certain governmental grants, such as Pell 
grants, and other federal or state government or nongovernmental programs, are recorded as either 
operating or nonoperating revenues in the University’s financial statements. To the extent that revenues 
from such programs are used to satisfy tuition and fees and other student charges, the University has 
recorded a scholarship discount and allowance. 
 
Deferred outflows of resources: Deferred outflows are the consumption of net position by the University 
that are applicable to a future reporting period. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the University’s deferred 
outflows of resources were comprised of deferred charges related to pensions and OPEB. 
 
Deferred inflows of resources: Deferred inflows are the acquisition of net position by the University that 
are applicable to a future reporting period. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the University’s deferred inflows of 
resources were comprised of deferred credits related to leases, pensions and OPEB. 
 
OPEB:  For purposes of measuring the net pension and OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and 
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and OPEB, and pension and OPEB expense, information 
about the fiduciary net position of the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions 
to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are 
reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are 
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair 
value.

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle:  
Beginning net position for fiscal year 2018 was restated as follows: 
 

Fiscal Year 2018
Beginning net position, as previously reported $75,009,093

Implementation of GASB Statement No. 75 (2,683,418)           

Beginning net positions, restated $72,325,675

 
 
New accounting pronouncement adopted in fiscal year 2018: The University adopted the following new 
accounting pronouncements during the year ended June 30, 2018: 
 
GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions 
  
GASB No. 75 was issued in June 2015, and addresses accounting and financial reporting for OPEB that 
is provided to the employees of state and local governmental employers. This Statement establishes 
standards for recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of 
resources, and expense/expenditures. For a defined benefit OPEB, this Statement identifies the methods 
and assumptions that are required to be used to project benefit payments, discount projected benefit 
payments to their actuarial present value, and attribute that present value to periods of employee service. 
Note disclosure and required supplementary information requirements about defined benefit OPEB 
also are addressed. The University’s OPEB plans are subject to this new standard and as a result, the 
University’s beginning net position as of July 1, 2017, has been reduced by $2,683,418 from its previously 
reported net position. Amounts for 2017 have not been restated because to do so would be impractical, 
and therefore is not required under the new standard. 
 

Note 2. Deposits and Investments 
Deposits: Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that in the event of a bank or other institution failure, 
the University’s deposits may not be returned or the University will not be able to recover collateral securities 
in the possession of an outside party.  The University deposits its funds with the Office of the State Treasurer 
(OST).  Oklahoma statutes require OST to ensure that all state funds either be insured by Federal Deposit 
Insurance, collateralized by securities held by the cognizant Federal Reserve Bank, or invested in U.S. 
government obligations.  The University’s deposits with the State Treasurer are pooled with the funds of 
other State agencies and then, in accordance with statutory limitations, placed in financial institutions or 
invested as the Treasurer may determine, in the State’s name.

The difference between the bank balances of deposits and the related carrying amounts were generally not 
significant and are due to outstanding checks and deposits in transit. 
 
Of the $22,192,362 and $22,295,630 in cash and cash equivalents on deposit with the State Treasurer as 
of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, $15,610,187 and $16,768,300, respectively, represent 
amounts held within OK INVEST, an internal investment pool. Agencies and funds that are considered to 
be part of the State’s reporting entity in the State’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report are allowed to 
participate in OK INVEST.  Oklahoma statutes and the State Treasurer establish the primary objectives and 
guidelines governing the investment of funds in OK INVEST.  Safety, liquidity, and return on investment are 
the objectives that establish the framework for the day to day OK INVEST management with an emphasis 
on safety of the capital and the probable income to be derived and meeting the State’s daily cash flow 
requirements. Guidelines in the State Treasurer’s Investment Policy address credit quality requirements, 
diversification percentages and the types and maturities of allowable investments. The specifics regarding 
these policies can be found on the State Treasurer’s website at http://www.ok.gov/treasurer/.  An evaluation 
of the use and purpose of the Departments participation in the internal investment pool the amount on 
deposit with OK INVEST are treated as demand accounts and reported as cash equivalents.   
 
Investments:  Investments are recorded at fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The University’s 
investments are measured and reported at fair value are classified according to the following hierarchal 
input levels: 
 

1. Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  
 

2. Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar assets, or inputs that are observable or other forms of market 
corroborated inputs.  

3. Level 3 – Pricing based on best available information, including primarily unobservable inputs and 
assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset.

Note 2. Deposits and Investments (Continued) 
Interest rate risk: The University does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a means 
of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. 
 
Credit risk: Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the 
holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized 
statistical rating organization. The University is authorized to invest in obligations of the United States 
government, its agencies and instrumentalities; certificates of deposit or other evidences of deposit at 
federally insured depository institutions approved by the Board of Regents. 
 
Concentration of credit risk: All United States government obligations are held by the Federal Reserve 
Bank in the name of the University. The majority of the University’s certificates of deposits were invested 
through the State Treasurer. The Board has authorized short-term funds to be invested in any security 
currently available through the Oklahoma State Treasurer’s Office. Generally, these include direct 
obligations of the United States Government and its agencies, certificates of deposit and demand deposits.

In January 2011, the University entered into a contract amendment (contract) with Sodexo Operations, LLC 
(Sodexo) to provide food service management to the University. As part of this contract, Sodexo agreed to 
make a financial investment in the University in the form of equipment purchases and full repayment of the 
previous commitment with Aramark Educational Services, Inc. The overall investment made by Sodexo 
totaled $1,600,000, of which $650,000 of this investment is required to be amortized over a five-year period, 
with the remaining $950,000 amortized over ten years. If the University terminates Sodexo’s service prior 
to the complete amortization of the investment, the contract requires that Sodexo be reimbursed for the 
unamortized portion of the investment. The unamortized portion of this commitment is $237,500 and 
$332,500 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There is no stipulation for accrued interest relative to 
the Sodexo contract.

Note 7. Noncurrent Liabilities (Continued) 
Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority Lease Obligations (“OCIA”) 
 
In 1999, the Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority (OCIA) issued its OCIA Bond Issues, 1999 Series 
A, B and C. Of the total bond indebtedness, the OSRHE allocated approximately $2,000,000 to the 
University. Concurrently with the allocation, the University entered into a lease agreement with OCIA, for 
the project being funded by the OCIA bonds. The lease agreement provides for the University to make 
specified monthly payments to OCIA over the respective terms of the agreement, which is for approximately 
20 years. The proceeds of the bonds and subsequent leases are to provide for capital improvements at the 
University. 
 
In 2004, the OCIA issued bond series 2004A that refunded a significant portion of the 1999A bonds.  
Consequently, the amortization of the 1999A bond issue ended in 2010.  The lease agreement will no 
longer secure the 1999A bond issue but will now act as security for the 2004A bond issue over the term of 
the lease through the year 2020. 
 
In 2015, the University’s remaining 2004 lease agreement with OCIA was restructured through a refunding. 
OCIA issued new bonds, Series 2014B, to accomplish the refunding. The restructured lease agreement 
with OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be issued to refund 
earlier bond issues. The University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA was automatically 
restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring resulted in a reduction of principal, 
thus the University has recorded a credit of $63,421 on restructuring as a deferred inflow of resources that 
will be amortized over a period of five years. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the unamortized gain totaled 
$13,122 and $26,242, respectively. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and 
interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of $104,024, which 
approximates the economic savings of the transaction. 
 
In 2005, the OCIA issued its State Facilities Revenue Bonds (Higher Education Project) Series 2005F. Of 
the total bond indebtedness, the OSRHE allocated approximately $12,481,000 to the University. Total lease 
payments over the term of the agreement including principal and interest, beginning July 1, 2006 through 
July 1, 2030, will be $21,603,441. Payments will be made annually ranging from $352,845 to $1,198,785. 
Concurrently with the allocation, the University entered into a lease agreement with OCIA for the projects 
being funded by the OCIA bonds. The proceeds of the bonds and subsequent leases are to provide for 
capital improvements at the University. 
 
In 2011, the University’s 2005 lease agreement with OCIA was restructured through a partial refunding of 
the Series 2005F bonds. OCIA issued two new bonds, Series 2010A and 2010B, to accomplish this 
refunding. The restructured lease agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any 
future indebtedness that might be issued to refund earlier bond issues. OCIA issued the new Series 2010A 
and 2010B bonds to provide budgetary relief for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 by extending and restructuring 
the debt service requirements. Consequently, the University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA 
was automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring extended certain 
principal payments into the future, resulting in a cost on the restructuring. The University has recorded a 
charge totaling $938,840 on restructuring as a deferred outflow of resources that will be amortized over a 
period of six years. The deferred outflow has been fully amortized as of June 30, 2016. This restructuring 
resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and interest between the original lease agreement and the 
restructured lease agreement of $50,720, which approximates the economic cost of the transaction.

Note 7. Noncurrent Liabilities (Continued) 
In 2014, the OCIA restructured the 2005F issue by issuing new bonds Series 2014A. This restructuring was 
a partial refunding and resulted in a credit of $350,021 between the remaining liability of 2005F and the 
new liability of 2014A. This credit on restructuring was recorded as a deferred inflow of resources that will 
be amortized over a period of 18 years. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the unamortized gain totaled 
$258,945 and $280,375, respectively. The restructured lease agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond 
indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be issued to refund earlier bond issues. The 
University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA was automatically restructured to secure the new 
bond issues. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and interest between the 
original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of $817,087, which approximates the 
economic savings of the transaction. 
 
In 2006, the OCIA issued its State Facilities Revenue Bonds (Higher Education Project) Series 2006D. Of 
the total bond indebtedness, the State Regents allocated approximately $5,424,000 to the University. Total 
lease payments over the term of the agreement including principal and interest, beginning July 1, 2006 
through July 1, 2035, will be $12,955,724. Payments will be made annually ranging from $71,278 to 
$1,550,689, by the State of Oklahoma on behalf of the University. Concurrent with the allocation, the 
University entered into a lease agreement with OCIA, for the projects being funded by the OCIA bonds. 
The proceeds of the bonds and subsequent leases are to provide for University capital improvements. 
 
In 2015, the University’s remaining 2006D lease agreement with OCIA was restructured through a 
refunding. OCIA issued new bonds, Series 2014C, to accomplish the refunding. The restructured lease 
agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be 
issued to refund earlier bond issues. The University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA was 
automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring resulted in a reduction 
of principal, thus the University has recorded a credit of $430,320 on restructuring as a deferred inflow of 
resources that will be amortized over a period of five years. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the unamortized 
gain totaled $348,613 and $370,402, respectively. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in 
principal and interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of 
$2,610,019, which approximates the economic savings of the transaction. 
 
Lease payments to OCIA totaling $1,915,055 and $1,904,656 during the years ended June 30, 2018 and 
2017, respectively, were made by the State of Oklahoma on behalf of the University. These payments have 
been recorded as on-behalf payments for OCIA capital leases in the statements of revenues, expenses 
and changes in net position. 
 
Oklahoma Development Finance Authority Lease Obligation (“ODFA”) 

In 2002, the University entered into a capital lease obligation for the ODFA Oklahoma State System of 
Higher Education Master Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2002C in the amount of $2,910,000. Total lease 
payments over the term of the agreement, beginning June 1, 2003 through December 1, 2018, will be 
$4,031,199. Payments will be made monthly ranging from $5,687 to $255,688. Proceeds from the obligation 
will be used for the installation of equipment for energy conservation. 
 
In 2012, the University’s 2002C lease agreement with ODFA was advance refunded through the liquidation 
of reserve funds being held relative to the lease program and issuance of the 2011B ODFA Master 
Equipment Lease Refunding Bonds. Total lease payments over the term of the agreement, beginning 
November 15, 2012 through May 15, 2018, will be $1,544,566. Payments will be made monthly ranging 
from $10,410 to $20,650. Under the 2011B Series, lease payments made by the University are forwarded 
to the trustee’s bank by the OSRHE for future principal and interest payments on the master lease bonds. 
ODFA deposits the lease payments into an interest bearing sinking fund and may use the interest earnings 
to reduce the University’s future lease payments.

Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System 
 
Plan description - The University as the employer, participates in the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement 
Plan—a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the Oklahoma 
Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 defines all retirement benefits. The 
authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a publicly 
available financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS. 
 
Benefits provided - OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to members of the plan.  
Benefit provisions include: 
  

• Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years of credited 
Oklahoma service. Members who joined the System on June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire 
at maximum benefits when age and years of creditable service total 80. Members joining the 
System after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their age and years of 
creditable service total 90. Members whose age and service do not equal the eligible limit may 
receive reduced benefits as early as age 55, and at age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on 
their years of service. The maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2% of final compensation for 
each year of credited service. 

 
• Final compensation for members who joined the System prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as the 

average salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for members 
joining the System after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive 
years of annual compensation in which contributions have been made. The final average 
compensation is limited for service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, 
depending on the member’s election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits 
accumulated after June 30, 1995 are calculated based on each member’s final average 
compensation, except for certain employees of the two comprehensive universities. Upon the death 
of a member who has not yet retired, the designated beneficiary shall receive the member’s total 
contributions plus 100% of interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with interest rates 
varying based on time of service. A surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, 
in lieu of the aforementioned benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled to at the time 
of death as provided under the Joint Survivor Benefit Option. 

 
• Upon the death of a retired member, the System will pay $5,000 to the designated beneficiary, in 

addition to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the member.  

• A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. The 
disability benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable years of credited 
service.

Note 8.    Retirement Plans (Continued) 
 

• Upon separation from the System, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based on 
certain restrictions provided in the plan, or by the IRC.  

 
• Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program up to the 

exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b).  
 
At the election of each eligible member initiating receipt of retirement benefits, the System remits between 
$100 and $105 per month per eligible retiree to the Employees Group Insurance Division (“EGID”), 
depending on the members’ years of service during 2018 and 2017. 
 
Contributions - The contributions requirements of the Plan are at an established rate determine by 
Oklahoma Statute, amended by the Oklahoma Legislature, and are not based on actuarial calculations.  
Employees are required to contribute 7% percent of their annual pay.  Participating employers are required 
to contribute 8.55% of the employees’ annual pay and an additional 8.25% for any employees’ salaries 
covered by federal funds.  
 
Contributions to the pension plan from the University were $2,100,368 and $1,827,120 for the years ended 
June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively.  The State of Oklahoma also made on-behalf contributions 
to OTRS totaling $1,344,571 and $1,460,460 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, 
respectively. These on-behalf payments did not meet the criteria of a special funding situation. 
 
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to Pensions - At June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, the University reported a liability 
of $31,918,476 and $42,045,504, respectively, for its proportionate share of the net pension liability. The 
net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017 and as of June 30, 2016, and the total pension 
liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 
2017 and June 30, 2016. The University’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the 
University’s contributions received by the pension plan relative to the total contributions received by pension 
plan for all participating employers as of June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.  Based upon this information, 
the University’s proportion for June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 was .482056 and .503809 percent.  For 
the years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, the University recognized pension expense of 
$3,180,788 and $4,427,823, respectively.

Discount Rate- A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 
2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of 
return on pension plan investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash 
flows, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to 
finance all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate 
of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine 
the total pension liability. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed 
that plan member and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level 
percentage of payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the 
matching contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five 
years of actual contributions.

OTRS OPEB Plan 
 
Plan description: The University as the employer, participates in the Supplemental Health Insurance 
Program—a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Oklahoma 
Teachers Retirement System (OTRS). Title 74 O. S. Sec. 1316.3 defines the health insurance benefits. 
The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a 
publicly available financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS 
 
Benefits provided: OTRS pays a medical insurance supplement to eligible members who elect to continue 
their employer provided health insurance. The supplement payment is between $100 and $105 per month, 
remitted to Oklahoma State University Human Resources, provided the member has ten (10) years of 
Oklahoma service prior to retirement.

Note 9.  Other Post-Employment Insurance Benefits (Continued) 
 
Contributions: Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 
contained in Title 70, as amended. However the statutes do not specify or identify any particular contribution 
source to pay the health insurance subsidy. Based on the contribution requirements of Title 70 employers 
and employees contribute a single amount based on a single contribution rate as described in Note 8; from 
this amount OTRS allocates a portion of the contributions to the supplemental health insurance program.  
The cost of the supplemental health insurance program averages 1.56% of normal cost, as determined by 
an actuarial valuation. Contributions allocated to the OPEB plan from the University were $33,350. 
 
OPEB Liabilities(Assets), OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to OPEB: - At June 30, 2018, the University reported an asset of $214,969 for its 
proportionate share of the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and 
the total OPEB asset used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
June 30, 2017. The University’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on the University’s 
contributions received by the OPEB plan relative to the total contributions received by the OPEB plan for 
all participating employers as of June 30, 2017.  Based upon this information, the University’s proportion 
was .48205% percent. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the University recognized OPEB (benefit) expense of ($8,405).  At

actuarial valuation prepared as if June 30, 2017 using the following actuarial assumptions:  
 

• Actuarial Cost Method - Entry Age  
• Inflation - 2.50%  
• Future Ad Hoc Cost-of-living Increases - None 
• Salary Increases - Composed of 3.25% inflation, including 2.50% price inflation, plus a service-

related component ranging from 0.00% to 8% based on years of service.  
• Investment Rate of Return – 7.50%  
• Retirement Age - Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted 

by the Board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five year experience study for the period 
ending June 30, 2014.  

• Mortality Rates after Retirement – Males: RP-2000 Combined Mortality Table for males with

Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the plan’s target

Total 100.00%

** The Real Estate total expected return is a combination of US Direct Real Estate (unlevered) 
and US Value added Real Estate (unlevered)  

 
Discount Rate: A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total OPRB liability (asset) as of 
June 30, 2017.  This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on OPEB plan 
investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the OPEB plan’s 
fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future 
benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability 
(asset). The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member 
and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of 
payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the matching 
contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five years of 
actual contributions. 
 
Sensitivity of the Net OPEB Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate: The following presents the net OPEB 
liability (asset) of the employer calculated using the discount rate of 7.5%, as well as what the Plan's net 
OPEB liability (asset) would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower 
(6.5%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.5%) than the current rate:

Benefits provided: The University provides medical benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents through 
the Oklahoma State University A&M System. This Plan allows employees who retire from the University to 
continue to be covered under the University’s Health Insurance Plan until age 65.  The retired participant 
must pay the active participant’s premium.  The medical rates for pre-65 retirees are the same as the rates 
for active employees so the benefit being provided is an implicit rate subsidy.  Retirees and dependents 
age 65 or older are provided a Medicare supplement that is not subsidized by the University.

Note 10.  Funds Held in Trusts by Others 
Beneficial Interest in State School Land Funds:  The University has beneficiary interest in the Section 
Thirteen State Educational Institutions Fund and the New College Fund. The Commissioner of the Land Office 
of the State of Oklahoma administers these funds as trustee for the benefit of state colleges and universities. 
The University has the right to receive annually 3.0% of the distributions of income produced by Section 
Thirteen State Educational Institutions Fund and 100% of the distributions of income produced by the 
University’s New College Fund. The University received $2,172,354 and $1,998,187 during the years ended 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is restricted to the construction or acquisition of buildings, 
equipment or other capital items. These amounts are recorded as restricted state appropriations in the 
statements of revenues, expenses and changes in net position. 
 
State law prohibits the distribution of any corpus of these funds to the beneficiaries. The total trust reserve for 
the University, held in trust by the Commissioners of the Land Office, was $39,935,708 and $38,710,108 at 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 
Oklahoma City Community Foundation:  The University is the income beneficiary of certain investments 
that are owned and managed by the Oklahoma City Community Foundation, Inc., for the University’s benefit. 
These investments totaled approximately $1,280,000 and $1,223,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 
2017, respectively. Legal title is retained by the Oklahoma City Community Foundation and payments are 
deposited in the Langston University Foundation as received. 
 
Langston University Endowment:  In 1999, the State of Oklahoma began appropriating funds for a special 
designated endowment fund for the University. The funds are appropriated to the OSRHE for the exclusive 
benefit of the University. The University has recognized its rights to these assets, held by the OSRHE as 
agent for the University, under the caption of funds held for the benefit of the University. The distribution of 
earnings on these funds may be used for any purpose approved by the Board of Regents acting on behalf of 
the University. The State of Oklahoma committed to making appropriations until $30,000,000 in endowment 
appropriations were made.  During 2015, the State contributed the final amount of $879,788 to the University, 
to fulfill the original $30,000,000 appropriation. 
 
A dispute exists between Langston and the Regents as to whether these funds are an asset of Langston or 
the Regents and both entities report the funds as assets. No legal determination has been made and both 
entities are component units of the State of Oklahoma.  
 
Funds held for the benefit of the University of $41,061,291 and $38,683,311 at June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively, were invested in The Common Fund for Nonprofit Organizations through the OSRHE as a 
part of its endowment. The University can request and expend up to 4.5 percent of the balance outstanding 
for general scholarship use and faculty enrichment or other such uses as approved by the Board of Regents. 
These amounts have been reflected as funds held for the benefit of the University in the statements of net 
position. As of June 30, 2018, and 2017, the available distribution to the University from OSRHE amounted 
to $3,554,886 and $4,385,331, respectively. 
 
Endowed Chairs Program:  The University participates in the State Regents Endowed Chairs Program. 
In connection with this, the State of Oklahoma has matched contributions received under the Endowed 
Chairs Program. The State match amounts, plus retained accumulated earnings, totaled approximately 
$3,185,000 and $2,946,000 for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is invested by OSRHE on behalf 
of the University. The University is entitled to receive an annual distribution of 4.5 percent of the market 
value at year end on these funds. Legal title of these endowment funds is retained by the OSRHE; only the 
funds available for distribution; approximately $345,000 and $427,000 June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively, have been reflected as assets in the statements of net position.

Note 11. Commitments and Contingencies 
The University participates in a number of other federally assisted grant and contract programs. These 
programs are subject to financial and compliance audits by the grantors or their representatives. Such 
audits could lead to requests for reimbursement to the grantor agency for expenditures disallowed under 
terms of the grant. The amount for expenditures that may be disallowed by the granting agencies cannot 
be determined at this time, although it is believed by the University that the amount, if any, would not be 
significant. 
 
Langston University is currently being audited by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) with 
reference to the use of funds provided by the USDA through a multi-year Evans Allen Extension grant.  The 
audit has not yet been finalized, with a conditional preliminary report having been received by the University 
only on September 20, 2018.  The preliminary report does not contain any specific findings of monetary 
liability being required to be repaid to the USDA by the University. The University has established a $2.2 
million contingent liability based on its estimated exposure to these claims.  

Risk Management 
The University is exposed to various risks of loss from torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; 
business interruption; employee injuries and illnesses; natural disasters; employee health, life and accident 
benefits; and unemployment. Commercial insurance coverage is purchased for claims arising from such 
matters other than torts, property damage, workers’ compensation and unemployment. Settled claims have 
not exceeded this commercial coverage in any of the three preceding years. 
 
The University, along with other state agencies and political subdivisions, participates in the State of 
Oklahoma Risk Management Program and the State Insurance Fund, public entity risk pools currently 
operating as a common risk management and insurance program for its members. The University pays an 
annual premium to the pools for its torts, property and workers’ compensation insurance coverage. The 
Oklahoma Risk Management Pool’s (the Pool) governing agreement specifies that the Pool will be self-
sustaining through member premiums and will reinsure through commercial carriers for claims in excess of 
specified stop-loss amounts.

Investments and Investment Return 

Investments in equity securities having a readily determinable fair value and in all debt securities are 
carried at fair value.  Other investments are valued at the lower of cost (or fair value at time of 
donation, if acquired by contribution) or fair value.  Investment return includes dividend, interest and 
other investment income; realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments carried at fair 
value; and realized gains and losses on other investments. 

Investment return that is initially restricted by donor stipulation and for which the restriction will be 
satisfied in the same year is included in unrestricted net position.  Other investment return is reflected 
in the accompanying statements of activities as unrestricted, expendable, or non-expendable based 
upon the existence and nature of any donor or legally imposed restrictions.

Note 12. Langston University Foundation, Inc. (Continued) 
Expendable and Non-expendable Net position 

Expendable net position are those assets whose use by the Foundation has been limited by donors 
to a specific time period or purpose.  Non-expendable net position has been restricted by donors to 
be maintained by the Foundation in perpetuity. 

Contributions 

Gifts of cash and other assets received without donor stipulations are reported as unrestricted 
revenue and net position.  Gifts received with a donor stipulation that limits their use are reported as 
expendable or non-expendable revenue and net position.  When a donor-stipulated time restriction 
ends or purpose restriction is accomplished, expendable net position are updated in the 
accompanying statements of activities as net position released from restrictions.   

Unconditional gifts expected to be collected within one year are reported at their net realizable value.  
Unconditional gifts expected to be collected in future years are initially reported at fair value 
determined using the discounted present value of estimated future cash flows technique.  The 
resulting discount is amortized using the level-yield method and is reported as contribution revenue. 

Conditional gifts depend on the occurrence of a specified future and uncertain event to bind the 
potential donor and are recognized as assets and revenue when the conditions are substantially met 
and the gift becomes unconditional. 

Contributed Services 

Contributed services are recognized as revenue at their estimated fair value only when the services 
received create or enhance nonfinancial assets or require specialized skills possessed by the 
individuals providing the service and the service would typically need to be purchased if not donated.  
Contributed services also include services received from personnel of an affiliate.  Contributed 
services received from personnel of an affiliate are recorded at the cost incurred by the affiliate.  See 
paragraph below listed Related-party Transactions for additional details.  

Income Taxes 

The Foundation is exempt from income taxes under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code and 
a similar provision of state law.  However, the Foundation is subject to federal income tax on any 
unrelated business taxable income. 

The Foundation files tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction.  With a few exceptions, the 
Foundation is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before 2014. 

Future Accounting Guidance 

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 
No. 2016-14 Not-for-Profit Entities (Topic 958). This update will affect reporting requirements related 
to net asset classes, cash flow presentation, liquidity and expense information, among other 
disclosures. The new guidance will be effective for the Foundation’s year ending June 30, 2019. The 
ASU permits application of the new not-for-profit guidance to be applied on a retrospective basis in the 
year that the ASU is first applied. The Foundation has not yet determined the potential effects of the 
new standard on the financial statements, if any.

Endowment 

The Foundation’s endowment consists of donor-restricted gifts established for a professorship in 
accounting and a gift to the University that was subsequently transferred to the Foundation and 
established as an endowment fund to participate in the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher 
Education’s (Regents) endowment matching program.  The program was initiated by the Regents to 
establish faculty chairs and professorships at institutions in the Oklahoma State System of Higher 
Education.  For universities to be eligible to participate in the program, they are required to maintain 
a specified minimum amount of funds in perpetuity for a specific endowed professorship chair.  As 
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), net 
position associated with endowment funds, including board-designated endowment funds, are 
classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. 

The Foundation’s governing body has interpreted the State of Oklahoma Prudent Management of 
Institutional Funds Act (SPMIFA) as requiring preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of 
the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the 
contrary.  As a result of this interpretation, the Foundation classifies as non-expendable net position 
(a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of 
subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment 
made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the 
accumulation is added to the fund.  The remaining portion of donor-restricted endowment funds is 
classified as expendable net position until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the 
Foundation in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by SPMIFA.  In 
accordance with SPMIFA, the Foundation considers the following factors in making a determination 
to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 

1. Duration and preservation of the fund 

2. Purposes of the Foundation and the fund 

3. General economic conditions 

4. Possible effect of inflation and deflation 

5. Expected total return from investment income and appreciation or depreciation of 
investments 

6. Other resources of the Foundation 

7. Investment policies of the Foundation

Langston University  
(An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges) 
Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 12. Langston University Foundation, Inc. (Continued) 

The Foundation has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt 
to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs and other items supported by its endowment 
while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment.  Endowment assets include those 
assets of donor-restricted endowment funds the Foundation must hold in perpetuity or for donor-
specified periods.  Under the Foundation’s policies, as approved by the Board of Directors, 
endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed 5% of 
the average market value of the preceding three fiscal years while assuming a moderate level of 
investment risk.  Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. 

To satisfy its long-term rate of return objectives, the Foundation relies on a total return strategy in 
which investment returns are achieved through both current yield (investment income, such as 
dividends and interest) and capital appreciation (both realized and unrealized).  The Foundation 
targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater emphasis on equity-based investments to 
achieve its long-term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. 

The Foundation has a policy (the spending policy) of appropriating for expenditure each year a rate 
of 5%, with an absolute maximum of 5% of the endowment fund’s average market value as of the 
preceding three fiscal year-ends.  In establishing this policy, the Foundation considered the long-
term expected return on its endowment.  Accordingly, over the long term, the Foundation expects 
the current spending policy to allow its endowment to grow comparable to the benchmarks outlined 
in the investment policy.  This is consistent with the Foundation’s objective to maintain the purchasing 
power of endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term, as well as to provide additional 
real growth through new gifts and investment return.  In 2018 and 2017, the Foundation did not 
appropriate any endowment funds as provided by the above described spending policy. 

Related-Party Transactions 

The Foundation engages in various related-party transactions with the University. 

The Foundation appropriates program receipts and designated contributions from donors to the 
University or directly to students of the University.  For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the 
Foundation disbursed $363,945 and $452,755, respectively, to the University or directly to students 
of the University for student scholarships and various university departments. 

The Foundation adopted Accounting Standards Update 2013-06, Services Received from Personnel 
of an Affiliate, which requires recognition of personnel services received from an affiliate for which 
the organization was not charged.  The Foundation received contributed personnel services from the 
University of $131,000 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  These costs were allocated to 
management and administrative expenses, and fundraising expenses in the amounts of $98,500 and 
$32,500 for June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.  The contributed personnel services are based on an 
allocation of costs incurred by the University.

Disclosures about Fair Value of Assets  

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.  Fair value measurements must maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There is a hierarchy of three levels 
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar 
assets; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are 
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the 
full term of the assets  

Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the 
fair value of the assets

 

Recurring Measurements 

The following tables present the fair value measurements of assets recognized in the accompanying 
statements of financial position measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the 
fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at June 30:

Disclosures about Fair Value of Assets  

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date.  Fair value measurements must maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  There is a hierarchy of three levels 
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  

Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar 
assets; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are 
observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the 
full term of the assets  

Level 3 Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and significant to the 
fair value of the assets

 

Recurring Measurements 

The following tables present the fair value measurements of assets recognized in the accompanying 
statements of financial position measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the level within the 
fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall at June 30:

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND 

ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS  

 

Board of Regents for the  

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 

Langston University 

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 

 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 

the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller 

General of the United States, the financial statements of Langston University (the “University”), an organizational 

unit of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (the “Regents”), a component 

unit of the State of Oklahoma, and its discretely presented component unit, that comprise the statement of net 

position, as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of revenue, expenses and changes in net position and cash 

flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the 

University’s basic financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated October 31, 2018. Our report 

includes paragraphs related to the reporting entity and a change in accounting principle as described in our report 

on the University’s financial statements. The financial statements of Langston University Foundation (the 

“Foundation”), the University’s discretely presented component unit, were not audited in accordance with 

Government Auditing Standards and accordingly this report does not include reporting on internal control over 

financial reporting or instances of reportable noncompliance associated with the Foundation.  

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the University’s internal control 

over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 

for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 

opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 

effectiveness of the University’s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 

employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 

misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 

control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements 

will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 

combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough 

to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 

was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 

deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified. 

We did identify certain deficiencies in internal control, described in the accompanying schedule of findings and 

questioned costs as Finding 2018-001 that we consider to be a material weakness. 

http://www.jmacpas.com/


 

 
 

Compliance and Other Matters  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the University’s financial statements are free from material 

misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 

agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 

statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of 

our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 

noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

University’s Response to Findings   

The University’s response to the finding identified in our engagement is described in the accompanying schedule 

of findings and questioned costs. The University’s response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in 

the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it. 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 

results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control or on 

compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards 

in considering the University’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable 

for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM  

AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE; 

AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL 

AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

  

Board of Regents for the  

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 

Langston University 

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program  

We have audited Langston University’s (the “University”), an organizational unit of the Board of Regents for the 

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (the “Regents”), which is a component unit of the State of 

Oklahoma, compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement 

that could have a direct and material effect on each of the University’s major federal programs for the year ended 

June 30, 2018. The University’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section 

of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its 

federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the University’s major federal programs based 

on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in 

accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to 

financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 

States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 

Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards 

and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 

noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 

effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the 

University’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary 

in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. 

However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the University’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the University complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred 

to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended 

June 30, 2018.  

http://www.jmacpas.com/


 

 
 

Other Matters 

The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance, which are required to be reported in 

accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and 

questioned costs as Findings 2018-002, 2018-003, 2018-004, and 2018-005. Our opinion on each major federal 

program is not modified with respect to these matters. 

The University’s responses to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit are described in the accompanying 

schedule of findings and questioned costs. The University’s responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures 

applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them. 

Report on Internal Control over Compliance  

Management of the University is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 

compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of 

compliance, we considered the University’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that 

could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are 

appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal 

program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but 

not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, 

we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control over compliance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the preceding 

paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material 

weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that 

have not been identified. However, as discussed below, we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over 

compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses and significant deficiencies. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance 

does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 

or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. 

A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 

control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 

compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 

We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of 

findings and questioned costs as Finding 2018-005 to be a material weakness. 

A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in 

internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than 

a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 

with governance. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying 

schedule of findings and questioned costs as Findings 2018-002, 2018-003, 2018-004 to be significant deficiencies. 

The University’s responses to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our audit are described in 

the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The University’s responses were not subjected to the 

auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of 

internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. 

Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.  

  



 

 
 

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance 

We have audited the financial statements of the University as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 

related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the University’s basic financial statements. 

We issued our report thereon dated October 31, 2018, which contained an unmodified opinion on those financial 

statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that 

collectively comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards 

is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of 

the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and 

relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The 

information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain 

additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting 

and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and 

other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 

America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in 

relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

Section II--Findings Required to be Reported in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards: 
 
Finding 2018-001: Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
Criteria: The University should maintain a system of internal controls that ensures financial transactions 
are timely recorded, that all accounts are timely reconciled, and that all adjustments are recorded in order 
to generate accurate and timely financial reports. 
 
Condition: The accounting department did not have adequate measures in place to ensure transactions 
were recorded in a timely manner, reconciliations were complete, and drawdowns of federal funds were 
completed on a monthly basis.  Policies and procedures were not formalized regarding the processing and 
recording of transactions to provide guidance for both existing and new employees.  This impacted the 
University’s ability to prepare accurate and timely financial reports for use in managing the operations of 
the University. The lack of formal processes and training have impacted the University’s ability to timely 
request reimbursement drawdowns from grantors as well as make timely payments to its vendors.   
 
Cause and Effect: The lack of documented procedures and training in key fiscal processes has impacted 
the performance of new and existing employees.  These issues along with accounting department turnover 
in the last year has resulted in their inability to prepare timely and accurate financial information for use 
in managing the operation of the University.   
 
Recommendation: We recommend that the University take steps to begin rebuilding the accounting 
department function.  Processes should be reviewed, evaluated and documented in writing to ensure that 
all transactions are processed and recorded in a timely and methodic manner, to ensure timely 
reconciliation of accounts, and the preparation of accurate and timely reports.  Staffing levels should be 
evaluated, and all existing and any new employees should be properly trained.  The University should 
consider utilizing resources available to it through either outside consultants or shared services available 
through Oklahoma State University.   
 
Management’s response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the recommendation as 
outlined.  The Fiscal and Administrative (F&A) Division is currently undergoing an evaluation of 
financial processes, and procedures.  LU is currently exploring options for shared services with Oklahoma 
State University and to engage with an external consulting firm to support financial reporting and 
accounting activities.  LU will evaluate staffing levels and plan to fill critical positions.

Section III--Findings Required to be Reported in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance: 
 
Finding 2018-002: Special Tests and Provisions – Enrollment Reporting 

Federal Program: CFDA # 84.063, 84.007, 84.033, 84.268 – Student Financial Assistance Cluster 
 
Criteria: The University must complete the Enrollment Reporting roster file that is placed in their Student 
Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) and return the file to the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) within 15 
days. At a minimum, the University must receive the file every 60 days, update the file for changes in 
student status, report the date the enrollment status was effective, enter the new anticipated completion 
date and submit the changes back to DOE either electronically through the batch method or through the 
NSLDS website. (FPL, 34 CFR § 674.19; Pell, 34 CFR §690.83(b)(2); FFEL, 34 CFR § 682.610; and 
Direct Loan 34 CFR § 685.309). 
 
Condition:  In our graduate testing, in a sampling population of five students, we noted five graduated 
students that did not have their enrollment status change reported to the NSLDS via the National Student 
Clearinghouse (NCS) within sixty days.  
  
Questioned Costs: None 
 
Cause and Effect:  The Academic Research and Financial Aid Offices are responsible for reporting all 
students’ enrollment status. The reporting errors were caused by miscommunication of duties. The 
Academic Research department was under the impression the Financial Aid department was performing 
this function and vice versa. 
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the institution monitor adherence to the procedures that need to be 
followed when a student graduates from the University. This will allow the University to report 
enrollment changes to the NSLDS within the appropriate period of sixty days from the date the institution 
determined the status change. It is recommended the University consider evaluating the procedure 
regarding reporting graduates to the NSLDS and update the procedure as necessary to ensure compliance 
with enrollment reporting requirements.  
 
Management’s response:  Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the cause and effect as 
well as the recommendation as outlined.  The Office of Institutional Research has been assigned 
responsibility for the NSLDS reporting of enrollment changes.  LU will closely monitor adherence to this 
procedure.

Finding 2018-003: Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles – 
Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses 
 
Federal Program: CFDA # 84.031 – Higher Education Institutional Aid 
 
Criteria: In accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards 
(Uniform Guidance). §200.430 Compensation—personal services - requires, in part, that: 
  

(1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately 
reflect the work performed. These records, in part, must: 
 
(i) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that the 
charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated; 

 
(vii) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost 
objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-
Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities 
which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or 
indirect cost activity. 

 
Condition:  During our testing of a sample of twenty-five payroll expenditures, we noted that the 
allocation of personnel costs between the federal grant and other funding sources for two of the 
employees tested was not supported by documentation that would indicate how the allocation percentages 
were determined.  The allocations used appeared to be based on allocations used in prior years as opposed 
to allocations based on contemporaneous information. Additionally, we noted that out of the sample of 
twenty-five payroll expenditures tested, fifteen did not contain records, such as timesheets, etc., that 
would document that the work had been performed. 
 
Questioned Costs: Unknown 
 
Cause and Effect:  The processes in place did not provide for the accumulation of information that would 
support the distribution of the employee’s salary to more than one funding source nor were the controls in 
place to ensure that timesheets or other records were in place to reflect the work performed. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the University review its processes as they relate to obtaining 
information to support the distribution of an employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost 
objectives if the employee is funded from multiple sources.  Additionally, processes should be reviewed 
to ensure documentation is obtained to support the work performed.

Finding 2018-003: Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles – 
Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses (Continued) 
 
Management’s response:  Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the recommendation as 
outlined.  LU is currently considering Shared Services for the administration of state/federal grants and 
contracts.  The rebuilding of the Fiscal & Administrative Division’s control structure, as noted in Finding 
2018-001, will play a key role in the success of grants and contracts administration on the LU campus.  
LU will closely monitor the progression of this endeavor.   
 
 
 
Finding 2018-004: Procurement and Suspension and Debarment  
 
Federal Program: CFDA # 84.031 – Higher Education Institutional Aid 
 
Criteria: In accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, 
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards 
(Uniform Guidance). §200.320 defines the procurement methods to be followed when expending federal 
awards. The Small Purchase method, which may be followed for purchases up to $150,000, requires that 
price or rate quotes must be obtained from an adequate number of sources. 
  
Condition:  Our testwork over a sample of twenty-five expenditures, noted one instance in which the 
required multiple quotes had not been obtained prior to the item’s purchase. Only one quote was obtained. 
The University’s procurement policy requires three quotes be obtained for purchases meeting the Small 
Purchase procurement method, as defined by §200.320 and described above. 
 
Questioned Costs: Identified ($24,633); Actual unknown. 
 
Cause and Effect:  The internal controls in place were not sufficient to ensure that the required quotes 
were obtained as required by the University’s procurement policy. This could result in federal program 
dollars being spent on unallowable costs. 
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the University review its policies and procedures related to 
procurements made under the Small Purchase method. 
 
Management’s response:  Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the recommendation as 
outlined.  The instance referred to above stemmed from a misunderstanding of the need for three quotes 
or the justification of a sole source affidavit, neither of which requirements was identified by internal 
controls.  The Fiscal & Administrative Division is undergoing an evaluation of processes, procedures and 
policies.

Finding 2018-005: Special Tests and Provisions  
 
Federal Program: CFDA # 10.500 – Cooperative Extension Service  
 
Criteria: The University is subject to certain provisions and restrictions regarding the use of its 
Cooperative Extension Service grant. 
  
Condition: On September 28, 2018, the Office of Grants and Financial Management, National Institute of 
Food and Agriculture (“NIFA”), United States Department of Agriculture, issued a preliminary report on 
the site visit to the University’s School of Agriculture and Applied Sciences conducted June 19th to June 
21st, 2017. The purpose of the review was to determine if proper administrative and financial controls 
were in place to manage and safeguard federally issued funds and whether those funds were used for their 
intended purpose. 
 
In that report, NIFA identified seven issues, which are summarized as follows: 
 
1. Time and Effort Reporting – NIFA is unable to make a determination of the accuracy of payroll 

allocations to NIFA grants by staff members with split appointments. No indication in the report 
as to the possible amount of disallowed costs. 

 
2. Non-segregation of State Matching Funds in the Accounting System – NIFA is unable to identify 

the application of state matching funds to specific NIFA grants. No indication in the report as to 
the possible amount of disallowed costs. 

 
3. Erroneous Data Reported in the FY 15 Renewable Resources Extension Act Program (RREA) 

Final Financial Report – NIFA noted errors in the final SF-425 submitted on October 13, 2016. 
The error totaled $587. 

 
4. Erroneous Data Reported in the FY 15 Extension Final Financial Report – NIFA noted errors in 

the final SF-425 submitted on June 13, 2016.  The error totaled $1,838. 
 
5. Disallowed Costs – LU Childcare Center – NIFA noted operational expenditures totaling $87,568 

for the Langston University Childcare Center were charged to the FY 15 Extension award.   
 
6. Disallowed Costs – Teaching Salaries – NIFA identified teaching salaries in the amount of 

$561,475 were charged to the FY 15 Extension award. 
 
7. Disallowed Costs – Scholarships – NIFA identified scholarships in the amount of $80,013 were 

charged to the FY 15 Extension award. 
 
In addition to the above, NIFA has presented the University with a letter summarizing questions it has 
related to possible additional disallowed costs related to payroll, matching costs, and operating expenses.

Finding 2018-005: Special Tests and Provisions--Continued 
 
NIFA has requested that the University utilize the services of the OSU/A&M Board of Regents Internal 
Audit department to follow-up on these additional questions as well as perform a self-audit of program 
expenditures related to the fiscal year 2016, 2017 and 2018 grants. 
 
Cause and effect: Generally, the findings identified appear due to the lack of policies and procedures in 
place to ensure proper administration of the federal grant as well as a lack of understanding of the grant 
requirements and limitations.  Failure to comply with prescribed program guidelines, or correct noted 
deficiencies in a timely manner could jeopardize the integrity and continued viability of the program at 
the University 
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the University consider these draft findings and take corrective 
actions as appropriate or provide adequate defenses to these preliminary findings.  
 
Management’s response:  Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the recommendation as 
outlined.  The planned evaluations and corrective actions as outlined in Finding 2018-001 and Finding 
2018-003 will be fundamental in establishing a strong and reliable grants program administration on the 
LU campus.

Finding 2017-001: Special Tests and Provisions - Common Origination Documentation (COD) 
Reconciliation  
 
Federal Program: CFDA # 84.063, 84.268, 84.007, 84.033 – Student Financial Assistance Cluster   
 
Criteria: In accordance with 34 CFR section 685.300(b) “In the program participation agreement, the 
school must promise to comply with the Act and applicable regulations and must agree to – (5) On a 
monthly basis, reconcile institutional records with Direct Loan funds received from the Secretary and 
Direct Loan disbursement records submitted to and accepted by the Secretary.” 
 
Institutions must report all loan disbursements and submit required records to the Direct Loan Servicing 
System (DLSS) via the COD within 15 days of disbursement (OMB No. 1845-0021).  Each month, the 
COD provides institutions with a School Account Statement (SAS) data file which consists of a Cash 
Summary, Cash Detail, and (optional at the request of the school) Loan Detail records.  The school is 
required to reconcile these files to the institution’s financial records.   
 
Condition:  During our School Account Statement (SAS) data file reconciliation testwork, we noted that 
the University did not perform the required monthly reconciliation process for the months of September 
and October 2016. The months were eventually reconciled with the November 2016 reconciliation. There 
was no activity to reconcile for the months of July and August 2016. 
 
Questioned Costs: Unknown 
 
Cause and Effect: During fiscal 2017, the University experienced turnover in the financial assistance 
department and did not perform the required reconciliation between the SAS data file to the University’s 
records.   
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the University perform/review the required monthly reconciliations 
between the SAS data file and the University’s financial records and follow up on any differences noted.   
 
Current Status:  This finding has been resolved in the current period.

Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities 
which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or 
indirect cost activity. 

 
Condition:  During our testing of a sample of twenty-five payroll expenditures, we noted that the 
allocation of personnel costs among federal grants for eight of the employees tested was not supported by 
documentation that would support how the allocation percentages were determined.  The allocations used 
appeared to be based on allocations used in prior years as opposed to allocations based on 
contemporaneous information. The eight individuals were funded by CFDA #10.205, 10.216, and 10.500.   
 
Questioned Costs: Unknown 
 
Cause and Effect:  The processes in place did not provide for the accumulation of information that would 
support the distribution of the employee’s salary to more than one federal grant. Controls were in place to 
ensure that timecards were prepared that documented that the employee actually worked during the 
period.  However, the information that would support how the salaries were allocated among the different 
USDA grants listed above, was not accumulated.

Management’s 2017 response:  
 
To enhance our current process, the University will develop and implement a new quarterly activity 
report.   This new reporting process will be effective December 1, 2017.  The quarterly activity report will 
incorporate the funding source and time allocated to each activity.  The report will be in addition to the 
current time and effort report and will be reconciled with employee profiles.  Adjustments to employee 
profiles will be made accordingly.  Our incoming Grants Compliance Manager will work with each grant 
program to ensure implementation of this additional control measure.   
 
Current Status:  Unresolved. Quarterly activity report not yet implemented. See current year Finding

LANGSTON UNIVERSITY 
MANAGEMENT'S CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN 

October 31, 2018 

Langston University respectfully submits the following corrective action plan for the year ended 
June 30, 2018. Our estimated completion date is the end of fiscal year 2019. 

Name and address of independent public accounting firm: Arledge & Associates, P.C., 309 North 
Bryant, Edmond, OK 73034. 

Audit period: July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. 

The findings from the schedule of findings and questioned costs are discussed below. The 
findings are numbered consistently with the numbers assigned in the schedule. Section I of the 
schedule, Summary of Audit Results, does not include findings and is not addressed. 

Section 11--Findings Required to be Reported in Accordance with Government Auditing 
Standards: 

Finding 2018-001: Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

Criteria: The University should maintain a system of internal controls that ensures financial 
transactions are timely recorded, that all accounts are timely reconciled, and that all adjustments 
are recorded in order to generate accurate and timely financial reports. 

Condition: The accounting department did not have adequate measures in place to ensure 
transactions were recorded in a timely manner, reconciliations were complete, and drawdowns 
of federal funds were completed on a monthly basis. Policies and procedures were not 
formalized regarding the processing and recording of transactions to provide guidance for both 
existing and new employees. This impacted the University's ability to prepare accurate and 
timely financial reports for use in managing the operations of the University. The lack of formal 
processes and training have impacted the University's ability to timely request reimbursement 
drawdowns from grantors as well as make timely payments to its vendors. 

Cause and Effect: The lack of documented procedures and training in key fiscal processes has 
impacted the performance of new and existing employees. These issues along with accounting 
department turnover in the last year has resulted in their inability to prepare timely and accurate 
financial information for use in managing the operation of the University. 

Recommendation: We recommend that the University take steps to begin rebuilding the 
accounting department function. Processes should be reviewed, evaluated and documented in 
writing to ensure that all transactions are processed and recorded in a timely and methodic 
manner, to ensure timely reconciliation of accounts, and the preparation of accurate and timely 
reports. Staffing levels should be evaluated, and all existing and any new employees should be 
properly trained. The University should consider utilizing resources available to it through 
either outside consultants or shared services available through Oklahoma State University.

P.O. Box 608 • Langston, Oklahoma 73050 • T: 405.466.3259 • F: 405.466.3420 • www.langston.edu 



Management's response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the 
recommendation as outlined. The Fiscal and Administrative (F&A) Division is currently 
undergoing an evaluation of financial processes, and procedures. LU is currently exploring 
options for shared services with Oklahoma State University and to engage with an external 
consulting firm to support financial reporting and accounting activities. LU will evaluate 
staffing levels and plan to fill critical positions. 

Section 111--Findings Required to be Reported in Accordance with the Uniform Guidance: 

Finding 2018-002: Special Tests and Provisions - Enrollment Reporting 

Federal Program: CFDA # 84.063, 84.007, 84.033, 84.268 - Student Financial Assistance 
Cluster 

Criteria: The University must complete the Enrollment Reporting roster file that is placed in 
their Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) and return the file to the U.S. Department of 
Education (DOE) within 15 days. At a minimum, the University must receive the file every 60 
days, update the file for changes in student status, report the date the enrollment status was 
effective, enter the new anticipated completion date and submit the changes back to DOE either 
electronically through the batch method or through the NSLDS website. (FPL, 34 CFR § 
674.19; Pell, 34 CFR §690.83(b)(2); FFEL, 34 CFR § 682.610; and Direct Loan 34 CFR § 
685. 309). 80 

Condition: In our graduate testing, in a sampling population of five students, we noted five 
graduated students that did not have their enrollment status change reported to the NSLDS via 
the National Student Clearinghouse (NCS) within sixty days. 

Questioned Costs: None 

Cause and Effect: The Academic Research and Financial Aid Offices are responsible for 
reporting all students' enrollment status. The reporting errors were caused by miscommunication 
of duties. The Academic Research department was under the impression the Financial Aid 
department was performing this function and vice versa. 

Recommendation: We recommend the institution monitor adherence to the procedures that need 
to be followed when a student graduates from the University. This will allow the University to 
report enrollment changes to the NSLDS within the appropriate period of sixty days from the 
date the institution determined the status change. It is recommended the University consider 
evaluating the procedure regarding reporting graduates to the NSLDS and update the procedure 
as necessary to ensure compliance with enrollment reporting requirements. 

Management's response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the cause and 
effect as well as the recommendation as outlined. The Office of Institutional Research has been 
assigned responsibility for the NSLDS reporting of enrollment changes. LU will closely monitor 
adherence to this procedure. 



Finding 2018-003: Activities Allowed or Unallowed and Allowable Costs/Cost Principles -
Standards for Documentation of Personnel Expenses 

Federal Program: CFDA # 84.031 - Higher Education Institutional Aid 

Criteria: In accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 
200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal 
Awards (Uniform Guidance). §200.430 Compensation-personal services - requires, in part, 
that: 

(1) Charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that 
accurately reflect the work performed. These records, in part, must: 

(i) Be supported by a system of internal control which provides reasonable assurance that 
the charges are accurate, allowable, and properly allocated; 

(vii) Support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities 
or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal 
award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or 
more indirect activities which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an 
unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity. 

Condition: During our testing of a sample of twenty-five payroll expenditures, we noted that the 
allocation of personnel costs between the federal grant and other funding sources for two of the 
employees tested was not supported by documentation that would indicate how the allocation 
percentages were determined. The allocations used appeared to be based on allocations used in 
prior years as opposed to allocations based on contemporaneous information. Additionally, we 
noted that out of the sample of twenty-five payroll expenditures tested, fifteen did not contain 
records, such as timesheets, etc., that would document that the work had been performed. 

Questioned Costs: Unknown 

Cause and Effect:' The processes in place did not provide for the accumulation of information 
that would support the distribution of the employee's salary to more than one funding source nor 
were the controls in place to ensure that timesheets or other records were in place to reflect the 
work performed. 

Recommendation: We recommend the University review its processes as they relate to obtaining 
information to support the distribution of an employee's salary or wages among specific 
activities or cost objectives if the employee is funded from multiple sources. Additionally, 
processes should be reviewed to ensure documentation is obtained to support the work 
performed. 

Management's response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the 
recommendation as outlined. LU is currently considering Shared Services for the administration 



of state/federal grants and contracts. The rebuilding of the Fiscal & Administrative Division's 
control structure, as noted in Finding 2018-001, will play a key role in the success of grants and 
contracts administration on the LU campus. LU will closely monitor the progression of this 
endeavor. 

Finding 2018-004: Procurement and Suspension and Debarment 

Federal Program: CFDA # 84.031 - Higher Education Institutional Aid 

Criteria: In accordance with the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 
200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal 
Awards (Uniform Guidance). §200.320 defines the procurement methods to be followed when 
expending federal awards. The Small Purchase method, which may be followed for purchases up 
to $150,000, requires that price or rate quotes must be obtained from an adequate number of 
sources. 

Condition: Our testwork over a sample of twenty-five expenditures, noted one instance in which 
the required multiple quotes had not been obtained prior to the item's purchase. Only one quote 
was obtained. The University's procurement policy requires three quotes be obtained for 
purchases meeting the Small Purchase procurement method, as defined by §200.320 and 
described above. 

Questioned Costs: Identified ($24,633); Actual unknown. 

Cause and Effect: The internal controls in place were not sufficient to ensure that the required 
quotes were obtained as required by the University's procurement policy. This could result in 
federal program dollars being spent on unallowable costs. 

Recommendation: We recommend the University review its policies and procedures related to 
procurements made under the Small Purchase method. 

Management's response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the 
recommendation as outlined. The instance referred to above stemmed from a misunderstanding 
of the need for three quotes or the justification of a sole source affidavit, neither of which 
requirements was identified by internal controls. The Fiscal & Administrative Division is 
undergoing an evaluation of processes, procedures and policies. 

Finding 2018-005: Special Tests and Provisions 

Federal Program: CFDA # 10.500 - Cooperative Extension Service 

Criteria: The University is subject to certain provisions and restrictions regarding the use of its 
Cooperative Extension Service grant. 

Condition: On September 28, 2018, the Office of Grants and Financial Management, National 
Institute of Food and Agriculture ("NIFA"), United States Department of Agriculture, issued a 



preliminary report on the site visit to the University's School of Agriculture and Applied 
Sciences conducted June 19m to June 215\ 2017. The purpose of the review was to determine if 
proper administrative and financial controls were in place to manage and safeguard federally 
issued funds and whether those funds were used for their intended purpose. 

In that report, NIFA identified seven issues, which are summarized as follows: 

1. Time and Effort Reporting - NIF A is unable to make a determination of the accuracy of 
payroll allocations to NIFA grants by staff members with split appointments. No 
indication in the report as to the possible amount of disallowed costs. 

2. Non-segregation of State Matching Funds in the Accounting System - NIFA is unable to 
identify the application of state matching funds to specific NIFA grants. No indication in 
the report as to the possible amount of disallowed costs. 

3. Erroneous Data Reported in the FY 15 Renewable Resources Extension Act Program 
(RREA) Final Financial Report - NIFA noted errors in the final SF-425 submitted on 
October 13, 2016. The error totaled $587. 

4. Erroneous Data Reported in the FY 15 Extension Final Financial Report - NIFA noted 
errors in the final SF-425 submitted on June 13, 2016. The error totaled $1,838. 

5. Disallowed Costs - LU Childcare Center - NIF A noted operational expenditures totaling 
$87,568 for the Langston University Childcare Center were charged to the FY 15 
Extension award. 

6. Disallowed Costs - Teaching Salaries - NIFA identified teaching salaries in the amount 
of $561,475 were charged to the FY 15 Extension award. 

7. Disallowed Costs - Scholarships - NIF A identified scholarships in the amount of 
$80,013 were charged to the FY 15 Extension award. 

In addition to the above, NIFA has presented the University with a letter summarizing questions 
it has related to possible additional disallowed costs related to payroll, matching costs, and 
operating expenses. 

NIFA has requested that the University utilize the services of the OSU/A&M Board of Regents 
Internal Audit department to follow-up on these additional questions as well as perform a self-
audit of program expenditures related to the fiscal year 2016, 2017 and 2018 grants. 

Cause and effect: Generally, the findings identified appear due to the lack of policies and 
procedures in place to ensure proper administration of the federal grant as well as a lack of 
understanding of the grant requirements and limitations. Failure to comply with prescribed 
program guidelines, or correct noted deficiencies in a timely manner could jeopardize the 
integrity and continued viability of the program at the University 

Recommendation: We recommend the University consider these draft findings and take 
corrective actions as appropriate or provide adequate defenses to these preliminary findings. 



Management's response: Langston University (LU) Administration agrees with the 
recommendation as outlined. The planned evaluations and corrective actions as outlined in 
Finding 2018-001 and Finding 2018-003 will be fundamental in establishing a strong and reliable 
grants program administration on the LU campus. 

If the federal awarding agencies or pass-through entities have questions regarding this plan, please 
contact Gaylene Hargrove at (405) 466-3260.
