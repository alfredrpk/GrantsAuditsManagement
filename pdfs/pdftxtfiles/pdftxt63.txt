INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Honorable Board of Education
Jenks School District Number I-5
Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma

Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements – regulatory basis of the Jenks
School District Number I-5, Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the
table of contents.

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet financial reporting requirements of the State of
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the
financial statements in the circumstances.  Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, and the standards applicable to
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers
internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by the District, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions
of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma State Department of Education.
The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonable determined, are presumed to
be material.



2

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles

In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the District as of June
30, 2018, the changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended.

Unmodified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the assets,
liabilities and fund balance arising from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of the District, as of
June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for the year then ended on the regulatory
basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Matters

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the
District’s basic financial statements.  The combining statements – regulatory basis, are presented for purposes of additional
analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.  The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is
presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of
the basic financial statements.

The combining statements – regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic
financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial
statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our
opinion, the combining statements – regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

The management’s discussion and analysis and the budgetary comparison information on pages 3 through 6 and 32 through
36, respectively, are not a required part of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We have applied certain limited procedures, which consisted
principally of inquiries of management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation of the required supplementary
information. However, we did not audit the information and express no opinion on it.

Other Reporting required by Government Auditing Standards

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 8, 2019 on our consideration
of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws,
regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing
of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Independent School District No. 5 Tulsa County, Oklahoma
Jenks Public Schools

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2018

Jenks Public Schools provides this discussion and analysis of the District’s financial activities for fiscal year (FY)
ending June 30, 2018.  The intent of this narrative overview is to look at the District’s financial performance as a
whole. Readers are encouraged to consider the notes to the basic financial statements to enhance their
understanding of Jenks Schools' financial performance.  This is the 15th year the District has prepared financial
statements following Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 34 presentation.

Fund Financial Statements

This annual report consists of a series of financial statements.  The governmental-wide statements include the
Statement of Net Assets and Statement of Activities, which provide information about the activities of the entire
District, presenting both an aggregate view of the District’s finances and a long-term view of those finances.  The
District uses many funds to account for a multitude of financial transactions.  A fund is a grouping of related
accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or
objectives.  The District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with financial-related legal
requirements.  The fund financial statements focus on the individual segments of the District’s operations in
more detail than government-wide financial statements.  Because the focus of District funds is narrower than that
of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for District funds
with similar information presented for District activities in the government-wide financial statement.  Both the
District’s fund balance statement and the District’s fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in
fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between funds and activities of each.

Funds are classified into three categories:  governmental, proprietary, and fiduciary with each category divided
into separate “fund types.”  Governmental funds include General Fund, Building Fund, Child Nutrition Fund,
Sinking Fund, and Bond Fund. The District did not operate any proprietary funds, which use the same basis of
accounting as “business-type” activities in the private sector.  Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held
on behalf of outside parties, including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District, and
include, but are not limited to, PTAG (Parent/Teacher Association Group), Booster Clubs, Arbitrage, Workers
Compensation, School Student Activity Groups, and Community Education.

General Fund Highlights

The General Fund is the largest single governmental fund and comprises 69% of the total District revenue. This
fund represents a majority of the District’s day-to-day operational expenses. At the close of FY 2018, the District
reported positive cash balances in all funds with the General Fund balance being $6,773,300 which is a
percentage balance of 8.53% of revenue received for this fund. Per-pupil revenue collections were still below the
2007-08 funding level from the State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma’s structural budget issues continued to place
school districts in difficult financial positions. Jenks Public Schools Board of Education and Administration have
worked diligently to enhance and protect the fund balance reserves in order to address future revenue
reductions. In 2010, the Board of Education designated 8% as the District’s fund balance goal. To plan for the
opening of a new elementary school for the first time in 25 years and to deal with ongoing state budget issues,
the District implemented approximately $6 million in adjustments to the General Fund during the prior three
years.  After the adjustments were implemented, the District was able to meet its fund balance objective.

Fund Balances

As of the close of FY 2018, the District reported a governmental-wide ending cash fund balance of $56,182,268,
reflecting a decrease of $2,241,901 or 3.84% in comparison with the prior year. The General Fund’s ending
balance decreased by $1,048,741 due to increased costs to deal with the district’s increasing enrollment, the
opening of multiple facilities, and declining state per-pupil collections. Individual fund balances for the Building,
Child Nutrition, and Sinking Funds decreased in comparison with the prior year. The District’s Bond Funds
represented the largest cash fund balance increase with a growth of $1,023,966.

Fiscal Year 2017 – 2018 Summary

General Fund revenue collections for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, totaled $79,102,149, reflecting a net
gain of $3,777,682 from the original estimated General Fund revenue projections of $75,324,467 approved and
adopted by the Board of Education in June 2017. The increase in revenue was a result of growth in the net
assessed property valuation within the District and increases in the state dedicated collections and state aid
revenue due to student enrollment growth. District General Fund operating expenses totaled $80,439,815, which
was an increase of $4,829,634 over the initial adopted budget of $75,610,181. This included salary increases,
purchases for classroom supplies and equipment, increased operational expenses with the newly opened
facilities, and additional positions to address the needs of the District’s increasing student enrollment.

The internal controls, policies, and procedures relating to the financial operations of the District remained strong.
The 2017-18 audit reflects an unqualified opinion issued on the financial statements.  The audit discloses no
reportable conditions in the internal controls.  The audit notes no reportable instance of noncompliance will be
reported in accordance with GAGAS. The audit discloses no reportable conditions in the internal controls over
major federal programs. An unqualified opinion was issued on the compliance of major programs. The audit
discloses no findings which would require to be reported under OMB Circular A-133 section 510(a). (See page
52 of audit under the summary of audit results.)

Interest paid on general long-term debt during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, totaled $2,025,250.

Lease Revenue Bonds: Initially, the Tulsa County Industrial Authority issued $104,420,000 of Educational
Facilities Lease Revenue Bonds for Jenks Public Schools to provide funds required for the constructing,
equipping, repairing and remodeling of school buildings, acquiring school furniture, fixtures, and equipment,
acquiring and improving school sites for the benefit of Jenks Public Schools.  On July 1, 2009, the District, as



5

lessor, entered into a ground lease agreement for certain district property, with the Tulsa County Industrial
Authority.  In addition, the District entered into a sublease, as lessee, with the Tulsa County Industrial Authority.
The sublease called for eleven (11) annual payments with the initial payment made on September 11, 2010.
These acquisition payments will be made out of General Obligation bond funds, pursuant to the issuance of
series bonds in the amount of $153,430,000, voted on and approved by the patrons of Jenks Public Schools on
December 9, 2008.  Jenks Public Schools will gain ownership to the capital improvements incrementally as each
payment is made.

As of June 30, 2017, all projects associated with the 2009 Lease Revenue Bond have been completed with a
total cost of construction of $106,135,259.

On February 10, 2015, voters approved another Educational Facilities Lease Revenue Bond in the amount of
$83,725,000.  Proceeds associated with this bond were received during FY 2015-16.  Construction projects
completed during 2017-18 were Northwest Elementary, West Intermediate Expansion, East Intermediate Drive
Expansion, Central Dining Hall, High School Stadium Classroom and Press Box Renovation, Middle School
Athletic Field, and High School Renovation Phases II and III.

Capital and Fixed Assets

The District is in its 15th year of tracking all assets of significant value. The District’s fixed asset inventory
process requires equipment, furniture and fixtures, new construction and remodeled buildings and land be
updated annually with inventory software monitored through the Purchasing and Warehouse Departments.
Building structures and improvements are added to the inventory as projects are completed and space is
occupied.  For the year ending June 30, 2018, capital assets are as follows:

Beginning Increases/Decreases Ending

Capital Assets $321,926,048 $71,051,464 $392,977,512

Depreciation (71,385,810) (10,540,420) (81,926,230)

Total Capital Assets $250,540,238 $60,511,044 $311,051,282

2018-19 Fiscal Year Forecast

The Oklahoma state legislature provided the first tax increase in 28 years.  It was also the largest tax increase in
state history while providing funding for the largest-ever teacher pay increase. Common Education’s
appropriation grew by an additional $480 million which included salary increases for certified and support
personnel along with additional funding for health insurance and instructional materials. With a growing
statewide student population, increased operational funding to reduce class size will continue to be a request to
our state leaders. Current statewide collections are above prior year levels.  This will certainly give the
legislature additional funding to craft the FY 2019-20 budget. Another positive trend is the local net
assessed valuation (NAV) increased at a rate of 3.43%. Residential housing starts and commercial
development continue within the Jenks Public School District, and student growth increased by approximately
336 students for FY 2017-18 and by 180 students for FY 2018-19. Even with these challenges of growing
enrollment, the District is still projecting an ending cash fund balance of over 8%.

While future state revenue collections look to possibly have stabilized, the patrons of Jenks Public Schools are
very supportive of the District’s efforts to pass annual bond issues for needs such as classroom space, District-
wide technology, remodeling and maintenance on existing facilities, district-wide equipment, school safety, as
well as library books and textbooks for classrooms.

As we move through FY 2018-19, Jenks Public Schools will likely continue to face financial challenges.  The
District’s Board of Education has placed a very high priority on maintaining the District’s fund balance at a fiscally
responsible level. Therefore, the General operating budget is continuously monitored to ensure complete
alignment of expenses with available revenue.   The budget is amended once the District has received the
following information:

1. An accurate District “Net Assessed Valuation” certified by the Board of Equalization
2. Certified and audited prior year actual collected revenues
3. Final Federal grant award notifications for FY 2018-19 programs
4. Any increased State dedicated revenues



6

5. October child count conducted by the State regional accreditation officer assigned to our District
6. Any increase in Flexible Benefit Allowance funding from the State to pass on to employees who

elect to participate in the insurance benefits program
7. Notification of the District’s mid-year adjusted State Aid allocation funding
8. Potential actions taken by the Board of Education to increase the General Fund expenditure

budget in the form of salary increases, new positions, and programs

In closing, JPS has the full support of staff members, patrons, parent booster clubs, PTA/PTAGs, the Jenks
Public Schools Foundation and business partnerships that assist the District through fundraisers, the passage of
bond issues, and generous donations.  The Board of Education and Administration feel extremely confident and
take pride in the fact that the District is financially positioned to operate successfully and maintain the high
standards set forth by our staff and patrons.

Upcoming Oklahoma Legislative Action

Although much progress was made during last Spring’s legislative session with the passage of several measures
to stabilize funding and provide salary increases for staff members, especially teachers.  Unfortunately, the
financial decisions of past years’ Oklahoma legislative sessions continue to challenge all Oklahoma school
districts. With growing enrollment statewide, along with a teacher shortage, class sizes will continue to increase
without sufficient operational funding to school districts. It is imperative for the legislature to search for solutions
to increase revenue to fund the State’s core responsibilities.

Jenks Public Schools’ lobbying efforts for this year’s legislative session will specifically focus on legislation that
identifies a long term plan to increase funding for operational expenditures. We will support initiatives that
continue to improve teacher pay to help address the statewide teacher shortage and reduce class sizes. The
state board of equalization has predicted that the legislature will have an additional $612 million in funding to
craft the state’s budget for FY 2019-20.  It is vital that our elected officials make our students a priority when
making funding decisions.

District Cash Management Program

The District’s cash management program involves such factors as legal authorizations from the Board of
Education, liquidity requirements or cash flow needs, and interest rate trends.  The District is required to invest
all available monies in interest-bearing accounts or investment instruments that are authorized under State
Statutes.  These accounts must be fully protected through FDIC insurance and/or pledged collateral from the
participating institution.  The District uses a “pooled resources” concept, pooling together all the separate funds,
for purchasing investments to take advantage of the higher interest rates available when investing larger
amounts of money.

By Oklahoma statute, school districts can only invest in instruments backed by the full faith and credit of the
federal government. Interest earned from the district’s investment practices continues to be a General Fund
revenue stream. However, current market conditions have taken its toll on interesting earnings.  In FY 2008-09,
the District receipted $2,176,000 in interest earnings, as compared to the FY 2016-17 total return on investments
of $377,095. Interest earnings did increase for FY 2017-18 as rates increased on District deposits.  The District
earned $600,592 in interest for FY 2017-18, an increase of $223,497 from the prior year. JPS will continue to
utilize investment strategies and best practices to maximize the return on our investments even in today’s
recovering market.

Net change in fund balances - governmental funds (2,241,901)$

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of revenues, expenditures, and
changes in net position are different because:

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in governmental funds as expenditures.
However, for governmental activities those costs are shown in the statement and allocated
over their estimated useful lives as annual depreciation expenses in the statement of revenues,
expenditures, and changes in net assets. This is the amount by which depreciation exceeds
capital outlays in the period.

Depreciation expense (12,317,663)
Adjustment to beginning balance of capital assets (net of
accumulated depreciation) for assets purchased prior period 579,465 61,245,265

Some of the capital assets acquired this year were financed with general obligation bonds. The amount
financed by the bonds is reported in the governmental funds as a source of financing. On the other
hand, the proceeds from the bonds are not revenues in the statement of revenues, expenditures,
and changes in net assets but rather constitute long-term liabilities in the statement of assets, liabilities,
and net position. (28,530,000)

Repayment of bond principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds, but it reduces long-term
liabilities in the statement of assets, liabilities, and net assets and does not affect the statement of

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accompanying financial statements of the Jenks Public Schools Independent District,
No. I-5 (the “District”), have been prepared in conformity with another comprehensive basis
of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education as authorized by
Oklahoma Statutes. Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to
present financial positon and results of operations in conformity with the accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The District’s accounting
policies are described in the following notes that are an integral part of the District’s financial
statements.

A. Reporting Entity

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma
Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.
The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and
control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on State of Oklahoma
support.  The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of five elected
members.  The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. The Board,
constituting an on-going entity, is the level of government, which has governance
responsibilities over all activities, related to public elementary and secondary school
education within the jurisdiction of the local independent school district. The District
receives funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the
requirements of these funding source entities. However, the District is not included in any
other governmental “reporting entity” as defined in Section 2100, Codification of
Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since Board members are
elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate
management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary
accountability for fiscal matters.

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has
considered all potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit
in the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The basic – but not the only – criterion for including
a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body’s ability to
exercise oversight responsibility.  The most significant manifestation of this ability is
financial interdependency.  Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight
responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the
designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations and
accountability for fiscal matters.  A second criterion used in evaluating potential component
units is the scope of public service.  Application of this criterion involves considering

A. Reporting Entity – cont’d

whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is
conducted within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its
patrons.  A third criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or
exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships,
regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities.  Based upon
the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units included in the
District’s reporting entity.

B. Measurement Focus

The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net position and the
statement of activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the primary
government. Governmental activities are normally supported by taxes and intergovernmental
revenues.

The statement of net position reports the District’s financial and capital resources. Liabilities
are segregated between current (due within one year) and long-term.

The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given
functions or segments are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are
clearly identifiable with a specific function. Program revenues include 1) tuition or fees paid
by students or citizens of the District and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to
meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function. Taxes and other
items, including state aid, that are not properly included among program revenues are
reported as general revenues.

Funds are classified into three categories:  Governmental, proprietary and fiduciary.  Each
category, in turn, is divided into separate “fund types.”

Governmental Fund Types

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government’s general activities,
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing
of general long-term debt (debt service funds).

General Fund – The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those
required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program.

B. Measurement Focus - cont’d

Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for
programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service
on bonds and other long-term debt.  The general fund includes federal and state restricted
monies that must be expended for specific programs.

Special Revenue Funds – Special revenue funds include the District’s building and co-op
funds.  For statutory reporting purposes, the child nutrition fund is classified as a special
revenue fund in the other supplementary information, but is otherwise defined as a
proprietary fund type.

Building Fund – The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property
taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school
buildings and for purchasing furniture, equipment and computer software to be used
on or for school district property, for paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing
telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty insurance premiums for
school facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of security
personnel.

Co-op Fund - The co-op fund is established when the boards of education of two or
more school districts enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs.
The revenues necessary to operate a cooperative program can come from federal,
state, or local sources, including the individual contributions of participating school
districts.  The expenditures for this fund would consist of those necessary to operate
and maintain the joint programs.

Debt Service Fund – The debt service fund is the District’s sinking fund and is used to
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term
(including judgments) debt principal, interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources
are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings from
temporary investments.

Capital Projects Fund – The capital projects fund is the District’s bond funds and are used to
account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites,
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities and acquiring
transportation equipment.

Proprietary Fund Types

Proprietary funds are used to account for “business-type” activities similar to those found in
the private sector, where the determination of net income is necessary or useful to sound

financial administration.  Goods or services from such activities can be provided either to
outside parties or to other departments or agencies primarily within the District.  The District
maintained the child nutrition fund as a proprietary fund in the 2016-17 fiscal year, but
classified the child nutrition fund as a special revenue fund in the other supplementary
information for statutory reporting purposes.

Child Nutrition Fund - The child nutrition fund consists of monies derived from
federal and state financial assistance and food sales.  This fund is used to account for
the various nutrition programs provided to students.

Fiduciary Fund Types

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including
other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District.  The terms “non-
expendable” and “expendable” refer to whether or not the District is under an obligation to
maintain the trust principal.  Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that the
District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of
operation.

Expendable Trust Funds – Expendable trust funds include the gifts and endowments fund,
medical insurance fund, arbitrage fund, workers compensation fund and the sick leave
liability fund.

PTAG Gifts and Endowments Fund and M. Green Endowment Fund – These funds
receive their assets by way of philanthropic foundations, individuals, or private
organizations for which no repayment or special service to the contributor is
expected. This fund is used to promote the general welfare of the District.

Medical Insurance Fund – The medical insurance fund accounts for revenues and
expenditures for all types of self-funded medical insurance coverage.

Arbitrage Fund – The arbitrage fund is used to accumulate the earnings of certain
bond issues to which the Internal Revenue Service arbitrage rules apply. These funds
will either be retained or transferred to the Internal Revenue Service, depending on
future financial events and computations.

Workers Compensation Fund – The workers compensation fund accounts for
revenues and expenditures for workers compensation claims.

Insurance Recovery Fund – The insurance recovery fund is established to account for
receipts and expenditures for all types of insurance coverage and major
reimbursements and reserves for property.

Agency Fund – The agency fund is the school activities fund and community education,
which is used to account for monies collected principally through the fundraising efforts of
students and District-sponsored groups.  The administration is responsible, under the
authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.

Memorandum Only - Total Column

The total column on the combined financial statements – regulatory basis is captioned
“memorandum only” to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis.  Data
in this column does not present financial position or results of operations in conformity  with
accounting  principles generally accepted in the United States.  Neither is such data
comparable to a consolidation.  Interfund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation
of this data.

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounts
and reports in the financial statements.  Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the
measurements made, regardless of the measurement focus applied.

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is, in substance, the
format established by GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements – Management’s
Discussion and Analysis for State and Local Governments. All presentations are shown by
fund.

As to the basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on the
basis of cash receipts and disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the
Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows:

 Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for
the expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures when approved.

 Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.
 Investments are recorded as assets when purchased.
 Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not assets.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES – cont’d

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation

 Capital assets reported in the governmental-wide statements are recorded when
acquired and depreciated over their useful lives.

 Long-term debt reported in the government-wide statements are recorded when
incurred.

 Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the
obligation is paid.

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become
available and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be
recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types.

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must
be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31, for the fiscal year beginning the
following July 1.  If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold
an election on the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If the preliminary budget
does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget.  If an election is held and the
taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget.  If voters reject the
additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate.

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for all funds (with the exception of the
trust and agency funds) that includes revenues and expenditures.

The District prepares its budget in accordance with the Oklahoma School District Budget
Act.  The District’s final amended budget for the 2017-18 fiscal year was $143,219,663.

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or
services.  Encumbrance accounting – under which purchase orders and other commitments of
resources are recorded as expenditures of the applicable fund – is utilized in all governmental
funds of the District.  Unencumbered appropriations lapse at the end of each fiscal year.
While the Debt Service Fund is a governmental fund, a comparison of budget to actual
schedule is presented in the financial statements, although the board can exercise no control
of the revenue sources for this fund (except interest earnings), and no control over its
expenditures.

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity

Cash and cash equivalents – The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposit
accounts, and highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less
when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents.

Investments – The District considers investments of direct obligations of the United States
government and agencies, certificates of deposits, savings accounts or savings certificates
with maturities of greater than three months. All investments are recorded at cost, which
approximates market value.

Inventories – The value of consumable inventories is not reported on the combined financial
statements. At June 30, 2018, the District maintained $302,967 of consumable inventories.
This inventory is held in the District’s main warehouse and child nutrition warehouse.

Capital Assets – The capital assets acquired prior to June 30, 2001 are valued at appraisal
using standard or normal costing. Fixed assets acquired after June 30, 2001 are valued at
historical (actual) cost.

Depreciation of all exhaustible capital assets is charged as an expense against their
operations. Depreciation has been provided using the straight-line method over the following
estimated useful lives:

Useful Life Capitalization Threshold

Buildings and structures 10-50 $  2,500
Improvements 10-50     2,500
Equipment  5-40        300
Furniture and fixtures  5-10     2,500

The schedule below shows total fixed assets, and includes accumulated depreciation as a
memorandum item for information.

The capital assets for the year ended June 30, 2018 are as follows:

Beginning Ending

Capital assets 318,635,503$ 72,983,463 (1,358,546) 390,260,420

Warrants Payable – Warrants are issued to meet the obligations for goods and services
provided to the District.  The District recognizes a liability for the amount of outstanding
warrants that have yet to be redeemed by the District’s treasurer.

Encumbrances – Encumbrances represent commitments related to purchase orders, contracts,
other commitments for expenditures or resources, and goods or services received by the
District for which a warrant has not been issued.  An expenditure is recorded and a liability is
recognized for outstanding encumbrances at year end in accordance with the regulatory basis
of accounting. While the regulatory basis that is used for the Debt Service Fund approximates
full accrual accounting, the accruals recorded are reported to meet regulatory requirements,
as opposed to the requirements of generally accepted accounting principles.

Compensated Absences –The District’s policies regarding accumulated unpaid leave applies
only to unused vacation and accumulated sick leave and personal days for employees upon
retirement only.  The government-wide financial statements do not include any liability for
any rights to receive vacation, sick leave, or other employee benefits.  As of June 30, 2018,
the amount estimated as employee leave liability was $1,973,999.

Funds Held for School Organizations – Funds held for school organizations represent the
funds received or collected from students or other cocurricular and extracurricular activities
conducted in the District, control over which is exercised by the board of education.  These
funds are credited to the account maintained for the benefit of each particular activity within
the school activity fund.

Long-Term Debt – Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when
due, or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in
the following year.  For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed
from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a
governmental fund.  The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general
long-term debt account group.

Fund Balance – In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of
fund balances. The hierarchy is based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed
upon use of resources for specific purposes versus availability of appropriation. An important
distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between amounts that are considered
nonspendable (i.e., fund balance associated with assets that are not in spendable form, such
as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or items
that are legally required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund)) and
those that are spendable (such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or
receivables).

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted,
committed, assigned or unassigned, as appropriate.

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by
creditors (such as debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other
governments; or by law, through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific purposes
by formal action of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority. Such
amounts are not subject to legal enforceability (like restricted amounts), but cannot be
used for any other purpose unless the government removes or changes the limitation by
taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment.

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific
purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by the governing
body itself, or a subordinated high-level body or official who the governing body has
delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Assigned fund
balances include all remaining spendable amounts (except negative balances) that are
reported in governmental funds other than the general fund, that are neither restricted nor
committed, and amounts in the general fund that are intended to be used for specific
purposes in accordance with the provisions of the standard.

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. It represents
the amounts that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted,
committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the general fund.

F. Revenue and Expenditures

Local Revenues – Revenue from local sources is the money generated from within the
boundaries of the District and available to the District for its use.  The District is authorized
by state law to levy property taxes which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal
property within the District.  These property taxes are distributed to the District’s general,
building and sinking funds based on the levies approved for each fund.  The County
Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends
the tax levies on the tax rolls for submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1.  The
county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls.
The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1.  The second half is due prior to April 1. If the
first payment is not made in a timely manner, the entire tax becomes due and payable on
January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1, of  the  year following   the year
of  assessment.   If   not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for

the amount of taxes due.  The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the
taxes and penalty owed.  If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is
issued a deed to the property. Other local sources of revenues include tuition, fees, rentals,
disposals, commissions and reimbursements.

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is the amount of money from
funds collected by an intermediate administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the
District and the state, and distributed to Districts in amounts that differ in proportion to those
which are collected within such systems.

State Revenues – Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed
by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.
The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts
based on information accumulated from the Districts.

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors
disclosed by review.  Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions from or additions
to the revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs
be expended only for the program  for which the money is provided and require that the
money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following
year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  The State Department of Education
requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund.

Federal Revenues – Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the
form of operating grants or entitlements.  An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a
specific purpose, activity or facility. A grant may be received either directly from the federal
government or indirectly as a passthrough from another government, such as the state.
Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant to an
allocation formula contained in applicable statutes. The majority of the federal revenues
received by the District are apportioned to the general fund. The District maintains a
separate child nutrition fund and the federal revenues received for the child nutrition
programs are apportioned there.

Non-Monetary Transactions – The District receives commodities form the U.S. Department
of Agriculture. The value of these commodities has been included in the Schedule of
Expenditures of Federal Awards; however, they have not been included in the financial
statements as either revenue or expense since they are not reported under the regulatory basis
of accounting.

Interest Earnings – Represent compensation for the use of financial sources over a period of
time.

Non-Revenue Receipts – Non-revenue receipts represent receipts deposited into a fund that
are not new revenues to the District, but the return of assets.

Instruction Expenditures – Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly
with the interaction between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in
a school classroom, in another location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning
situations, such as those involving cocurricular activities.  It may also be provided through
some other approved medium, such as television, radio, telephone and correspondence.
Included here are the activities of teacher assistants of any type (clerks, graders, teaching
machines, etc.) which assist in the instructional process. The activities of tutors, translators
and interpreters would be recorded here. Department chairpersons who teach for any portion
of time are included here.  Tuition/transfer fees paid to other LEAs would be included here.

Support Services Expenditures – Support services expenditures provide administrative,
technical (such as guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate  and  enhance
instruction.  These  services exist as adjuncts for fulfilling the objectives of instruction,
community services and enterprise programs, rather than as entities within themselves.

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures – Activities concerned with providing
non-instructional services to students, staff or the community.

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures – Consists of activities
involved with the acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction of
buildings and additions to buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems and
other built-in equipment; and improvements to sites.

Other Outlays Expenditures – A number of outlays of governmental funds are not properly
classified as expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These are
classified as Other Outlays. These include debt service payments (principal and interest).

Repayment Expenditures – Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to
outside agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayment, non-
qualified expenditures and other refunds to be repaid from District funds.

Interfund Transactions – Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues,
expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or
expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are
recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed.

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are
reported as transfers.  Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported
as residual equity transfers.  All other interfund transfers are reported as operating transfers.

Custodial Credit Risk – Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the
District’s deposits may not be returned to the District. The District’s cash deposits and
investments at June 30, 2018, were $70,048,907, at financial institutions, and were
completely insured or collateralized by federal depository insurance, direct obligations of the
U.S. Government, or securities held by the District or by its agent in the District’s name.

Investment Interest Rate Risk – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will
adversely affect the fair market value of an investment. Due to the required liquidity for those
investments, these funds have no defined maturity dates. The District does not have a formal
policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value
losses from increasing interest rates.

Investment Credit risk – Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to an
investment will not fulfill its obligations. The District does not have a formal policy limiting
its investment choices, other than the limitation of state law as follows:

 Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrument to which the full
faith and credit of the U.S. Government is pledged, or obligations to the payment of
which the full faith and credit of the State is pledged.

5.   EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM

Description of Plan

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System,
which is a cost sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement
system  (PERS), which  is administered  by the Board  of  Trustees  of  the Oklahoma
Teachers’ Retirement System (the “System”).  The System provides retirement and disability
benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members  and
beneficiaries.   Title  70  Section  17  of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions
and may be amended only through legislative action.  The Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement



28

JENKS INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-5, TULSA COUNTY
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

5.   EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM – cont’d

System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and
required supplementary information for the System.  That report may be obtained by writing
to the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152,
or by calling 405-521-2387.

Basis of Accounting

The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for
accruals of interest income.  Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which
the contributions are made.  Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid.  The pension
benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension
benefits.  This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of  employee  services  performed  to  date
and is adjusted for the  effect of projected salary increases.  There are no actuarial valuations
performed on individual school districts.  The System has an under-funded pension benefit
obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation.

Funding Policy

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions.  The
contribution rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended
by Oklahoma Statutes.  The rates are not actuarially determined.  The rates are applied to the
employee’s earnings plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  The required contribution for the
participating members is 7.0% of compensation. Contributions received by the System from
the State of Oklahoma are used to offset required employer contributions by the local school
district.  For the 2017-18 fiscal year, the District contributed 9.5% and the State of Oklahoma
contributed the remaining amount during the year.  The District is allowed by Oklahoma
Teachers’ Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the
participating members.  In addition, if a member’s salary is paid in part by federal or private
funds, the contribution on that portion of the salary paid by those funds must be matched by
the District at 7.80%.

Annual Pension Cost

The District’s total contributions for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $7,554,193, $7,095,095 and
$7,116,241, respectively. Ten-year historical trend information is presented in the Teacher’s
Retirement System of Oklahoma Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2018. This
information is useful in assessing the pension plan’s accumulation of sufficient assets to pay
pension benefits as they become due.  Please visit www.ok.gov/TRS for all plan information.

GASB Statement 68 became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2014, and
significantly changes pension accounting and financial reporting for governmental employers
who participate in a pension plan, such as the System, and who prepare published financial
statements on an accrual basis using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Since the
District does not prepare and present their financial statements on an accrual basis, the net
pension amount is not required to be presented on the audited financial statements. The
amount of calculated pension liability for the District at June 30, 2017 (the latest information
available) was $66,688,905.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

The Honorable Board of Education
Jenks School District Number I-5
Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma

We have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements – regulatory basis within the
combined financial statements of the Jenks School District Number I-5, Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma (District), as of
and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the
District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated January 8, 2019, which was adverse with
respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did
not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, our report was
unmodified with respect to the presentation of financial statement on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the
Oklahoma State Board of Education.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financia l
reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of
expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
District’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely
basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and
corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not
designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies.  Given
these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material
weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.



49

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free of material
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant
agreements, non-compliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statements
amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and
accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other
matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

Purpose of this Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of
that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance.  This report
is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s
internal control and compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON
INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED

BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

The Honorable Board of Education
Jenks School District Number I-5
Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

We have audited Jenks School District Number I-5, Jenks, Tulsa County, Oklahoma (District)’s, compliance with the types
of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on
each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The District’s major federal programs are
identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

Management’s Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants applicable to its
federal programs.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs based on our
audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained
in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the audit requirements of
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and Uniform Guidance require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program.
However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In our opinion. the District, complied, in all material respects with the types of compliance requirements referred to above
that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.



51

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of the District, is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with
the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we
considered the District’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and
material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report
on internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of
the District’s internal control over compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not
allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect and
correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness
in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program will not be prevented, or defected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control over
compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we
consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal
control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly,
this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
