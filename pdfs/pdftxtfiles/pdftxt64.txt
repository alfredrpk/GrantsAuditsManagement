Tulsa Public Schools is a 173 square mile school district serving the city of Tulsa, the county seat of Tulsa 
County and the surrounding area in Tulsa, Creek, Osage and Wagoner Counties. The Tulsa metropolitan 
area (MSA) supports a population of 998,637 with an average household income of $70,981 (2017 
estimate, Tulsa Regional Chamber).  Approximately 94 percent of the district is located inside the city 
limits of the city of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  The remaining six percent lies in surrounding portions of Tulsa, 
Creek, Osage and Wagoner Counties.   
 
Tulsa was first settled in the 1830’s by the Lachapoka Band of the Creek Native American tribe.  For most 
of the 20th century, the city held the nickname “Oil Capital of the World” and played a major role as one of 
the most important hubs for the American oil industry.  Tulsa, along with several other cities, claims to be 
the birthplace of U.S. Route 66 and is also known for its western swing music. 
 
Tulsa Public Schools is the second largest public school district in the State of Oklahoma, with an 
enrollment (ADM) of 36,718 students in fiscal year 2017-18. The district is projecting a decrease in 
student enrollment to 36,684 in 2018-19. 
 
As of June 30, 2018, the district employed 5,907 employees, of which:

Tulsa Public Schools provides early childhood (pre-kindergarten for four-year old students), primary 
(kindergarten through 3rd grade), elementary schools (grades 4-5), middle schools (grades 6-8) and high 
schools (serving grades 9-12). 
 
During FY 2017-18 programs were delivered through 51 elementary schools, 1 partnership (elementary) 
school, 12 middle/junior high schools, and 9 high schools plus 8 alternative school sites.  The district 
contracted with 6 charter school organizations, Tulsa School for the Arts and Sciences, Tulsa Legacy 
Charter School, KIPP Tulsa College Preparatory, College Bound Academy, Collegiate Hall, and Tulsa 
Honor Academy.  In addition, 8 early childhood programs are delivered at school sites operated by not-
for-profits or partnerships with county agencies working in cooperation with the district.    
 
Program delivery occurs during the regular school calendar of 168 days of instruction annually.  The 
district also delivers programs through evening school operating year round and through summer school.  
In 2010-11, the district launched a virtual academy for secondary students. 
 
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK 
 
During FY 2017-18 the state general revenue fund collected approximately $5.85 billion in revenues. This 
is an approximate $812 million, or 16.1%, increase over the previous fiscal year. For fiscal year 2018, the 
general revenue fund beat the monthly estimate by $453.33 million, or 8.4%; it outperformed the monthly 
estimate nine out of twelve months during the year compared to only four times during the previous fiscal 
year.   
 
The City of Tulsa serves as one of the state’s two main economic centers.  The city has a highly 
diversified economy which includes health care, aerospace manufacturing, airline maintenance, and 
higher education, in addition to being a continued core of the oil and petroleum-related industries.

The improvement in the state and local economy is reflected in a decrease in unemployment. Tulsa area 
unemployment rate has decreased from 5.6% in September of 2016 to approximately 3.2% in September 
2018.  This rate is slightly lower than the state’s unemployment rate of 3.5%.  Tulsa as well as the state 
unemployment rate is slightly better than the national rate during this same time of 3.7%. 
 
For FY 2017-18 common education funding was less than the previous year, $1.85 billion versus the 
$1.87 billion in FY 2016-17. Tulsa Public Schools was cut approximately $2.7 million from the mid-term 
allocation of $88,107,206.  However, during the month of April the Oklahoma state legislature passed bills 
1010xx, 1023xx and 1026xx approving tax initiatives to generate approximately $505 million in additional 
revenue to support salary increases for teachers and support staff. Although this will primarily benefit the 
fiscal year 2018-2019, these additional taxes are viewed as a positive outlook for education funding.   
  
MAJOR INITIATIVES 
 
During FY 2017-18, the Board of Education and administrative staff worked closely together on a number 
of school improvement initiatives, which included increasing rigor in the classroom, reducing chronic 
absenteeism however, considering the state’s continuing economic uncertainty in combination with the 
district’s declining enrollment, additional initiatives under consideration were school consolidations. The 
district’s general fund preliminary budget for 2017-18 was $294,722,304. The budget was amended in 
April to reflect a budget of $297,024,734. 
 
During FY 2008-09, TPS applied for, and was accepted as a Teach for America (TFA) district.  TPS was 
originally awarded placement of 50 TFA teachers, and the local philanthropic community agreed to 
sponsor an additional group of approximately 25 new teachers.  In early 2011, TFA announced plans to 
locate their summer institute in Tulsa.   
 
During FY 2017-18, Tulsa Public Schools began work with 12 elementary schools on how to rearrange 
their time, people and money in order to achieve outcomes to improving school culture and or 
instructional practice. The School Planning Redesign Project is intended to better understand resource 
trade-offs in order to achieve specific instructional outcomes associated with our strategic plan: 

a) Catapult: Improve school culture, relationships and classroom management through Real-Time 
Teacher Coaching and No-Nonsense Nurturing and Improve instructional practice through 
content-specific Vision Walks 

b) Empower: Improve instructional practice through content-specific teacher collaboration AND 
Extend teacher reach through new content-specific focus and develop Empower Teacher 
Leaders, who will prepare for and facilitate collaborative planning time all achieved by creating a 
90 minute block of common planning time during the week using existing time and resources. 

 
During FY 2017-18, TPS also began work on developing a teacher preparation program. Tulsa Teacher 
Corps is a rigorous and supportive preparation program for aspiring teachers. With hands-on training in

STRATEGIC PLANNING 
 
On January 20, 2016, the TPS Board of Education approved Destination Excellence, the district’s new 
five- year strategic plan.  The plan was developed after countless of hours of engagement with Tulsa 
teachers, families, students, community members and administrators.  The framework for the plan was 
developed around the new vision and mission statements: 
 

Tulsa Public Schools is the destination for extraordinary educators who 
work with our community and families to ignite the joy of learning and 

prepare every student for the greatest success in college, careers, and life. 
 

Our mission is to inspire and prepare every student to love learning, 
achieve ambitious goals and make positive contributions to our world. 

 
This framework is based on the theory of change that the district’s community must be that of learners, 
contributors, and designers for students to succeed.  The strategies which have been deployed are: 
 

1. Create powerful learning experiences for all by implementing an aligned PreK-12 instructional 
program 

2. Cultivate safe, supportive and joyful school cultures 
3. Attract, develop and retain a highly effective and empowered team 
4. Incubate and implement innovative classroom, school and district designs 
5. Design the district to be adaptive and responsive in providing excellent learning experiences 

for students and families.  
 
The key outcomes that have been defined to measure the success of Destination Excellence are:  
 

 Graduation, College & Career Readiness: Graduation Rates and SAT scores 
 Academic Excellence: 3rd Grade Reading, Math & Reading Proficiency and Reading & Math 

Growth 
 School Culture: Attendance, Suspension Rate and Student Climate 
 Organizational Health: Novice Teacher Retention, Employment Engagement and District Office 

Service 
 
The Data and Analytics Office continually measures the key outcomes to determine the success of the 
deployed strategies.   
 
Additionally, the Board of Education continues to monitor the key analytics to determine the success of 
the Destination Excellence Strategic Plan. 
 
AWARDS 
 
In 2018, the Financial Services Department received the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in 
Financial Reporting from the Government Finance Officers’ Association (GFOA) for the June 30, 2017 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).  To receive the Certificate of Achievement for 
Excellence, applicants must prepare a CAFR that meets rigorous program standards as well as generally 
accepted accounting principles and applicable statutory requirements.  We believe that the CAFR for the 
year ended June 30, 2018 conforms to the Certificate of Achievement program requirements, and will 
submit this report to GFOA for review. 
 
The Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO) Certificate of Excellence in Financial 
Reporting was also awarded for the June 30, 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR).  
This award recognizes school districts that produce a CAFR meeting the principles and standards of

financial reporting as adopted by ASBO.  We believe that the CAFR for the year ended June 30, 2018 
meets these requirements and will submit this report to ASBO in application for this esteemed award.  
 
REVENUES 
 
Tulsa Public School’s 2017-18 general fund revenue totaled $309.9 million.  The primary funding source 
was the State of Oklahoma, with state revenue comprising 52 percent of the total, or $161.7 million. The 
following table further illustrates the funding source breakdown (millions):  
 

Sources of Revenue 2018 Percent 
Local $ 101.9 32.9% 
Intermediate 10.6 3.4% 
State 161.7 52.1% 
Federal 29.7 9.6% 
Other 6.0 2.0% 
Total $ 309.9 100.0% 

   
Of those amounts, ad valorem tax revenue totaled $90.7 million.  
 
Ad valorem tax revenues account for 88 percent of the building fund revenue and total $12.9 million. 
 
The child nutrition fund collects 74 percent of fund revenues from the federal nutrition program, 
administered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The federal free and reduced price lunch 
program was 96 percent of student lunches served by the district in FY 2017-18. 
 
CAPITAL PLANNING AND BOND FUNDS 
 
The district continues to follow a capital improvement plan developed in 1994 at the request of and with 
the input of the citizen’s bond development committee.  This plan addressed the needs of approximately 
8 million square feet of space owned and maintained by Tulsa Public Schools.   
 
The average age of the district’s educational buildings is 62 years, and 98 percent of the buildings are 35 
years old or older.  Since 1996, voters have approved bonds totaling $1,275.4 million for new facilities, 
technology, media centers, school buses and textbooks for all students.  Bond issues have received 
strong community support.  The district’s bonds are rated AA by Standard & Poor’s. 
 
On March 3, 2015, voters approved the single largest bond issue in the district’s history.  The $415 million 
authorization was approved by 85% of district voters.  The four proposals included $239,740,000 for 
buildings/facilities, $19,800,000 for library materials and additions, $17,025,000 for transportation 
equipment, and $138,435,000 for classroom textbooks and technology.  As of June 30, 2018, the district 
had $256.7 million in remaining bonds available from this authorization. 
 
FINANCIAL POLICIES AND CONTROLS 
 
District activities are governed by board-approved policies and regulations.  The board’s policy committee 
reviews all proposals for new or revised policies.  After review, the policy recommendation is placed on 
the board agenda for information, and then consent.  Policies are routinely reviewed by administrators to 
insure that they are consistent with current law.  The paragraphs below summarize the key policies that 
address the financial activities of the district: 
 

Accounting system – Defines the Oklahoma Cost Accounting System and its required compatibility 
with the budgetary control system.  Also provides approval requirements for journal entries. 
 
Financial reports and statements – Defines the periodic financial reporting requirements. 
 



 
INTRODUCTORY SECTION:  LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 

 

 

 16 

Types of funds – Establishes separate funds for accounting purposes. 
 
Depository of funds/banking services – Establishes requirements for bidding and investment 
services. 
 
Purchasing – Defines responsibilities and levels of authority in the Purchasing department. 
 
Solicitation requirements – Defines requirements for solicitations and competitive procurement. 
 
Expense reimbursement – Establishes authority for reimbursing employees for travel expenses. 
 
Audit – Requires an independent annual audit be performed in accordance with governmental 
auditing standards. 
 
Inventories – Requires an annual inventory of district assets, identifies capitalization thresholds, and 
identifies individuals responsible for maintaining inventory records. 
 
Budget transfer authority – Defines levels of authority and required approvals for budget transfers. 
 
Statement of income and expenditures and the related budget process – Establishes the 
timeline for preparing the annual statement of income and expenditures, and for preparing the annual 
school district budget plan. 
 

In addition to these explicit policies, the district maintains a strong internal and budgetary control 
structure: 
 

Internal control structure – District management is responsible for implementing and enforcing a 
system of internal controls to protect the assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to ensure that reliable 
accounting data are available for the timely preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
GAAP.  The internal controls structure is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance 
that these objectives are met.  The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of 
control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and that the valuation of costs and benefits 
requires estimates and judgments by management.  An evaluation of the internal control structure 
during the annual audit disclosed no material weaknesses.   
 
Budgetary control – The objective of the district’s budgetary controls is to ensure compliance with 
legal appropriation limitations and to provide an operating plan for the district’s resources.  The 
annual appropriated budget includes the general fund, special revenue funds, capital improvement 
funds, and debt services fund.  Preliminary budgets are adopted at the commencement of the fiscal 
year with periodic amendments approved by the Board of Education.  Budgetary control for accounts 
without a project is generally at the full account level.  For accounts within a project the budgetary 
control is generally maintained by fund, project and site.  These appropriated budgets represent the 
legally adopted fiscal plan of the district.  Board of Education approval is required for budgetary 
transfers totaling $25,000 and greater.  The district utilizes an encumbrance system as a budgetary 
control mechanism. 
 

Under GASB Statement 68, beginning with the 2014-15 financial statements, the district is required to 
report the proportionate share of the unfunded liability for the state’s Teacher’s Retirement System.  This 
represents a significant change in the district’s financial statements and is described more fully in the 
notes to the financial statements.  It is important to note, however, that (as established by existing case 
law) the pension liability is the legal obligation of the State of Oklahoma, not the local employer. 
 
Under GASB Statement 72, beginning with the 2015-16 financial statements, the district, in order to 
enhance the comparability of financial statements, is using fair value measurement for certain 
investments. 
 



 
INTRODUCTORY SECTION:  LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 

 

 

 17 

Under GASB Statement 77, beginning with the 2016-17 financial statement, the district disclosed 
information regarding tax abatements in the notes to the financial statements. 
 
Capital projects activity is controlled with approval of the bond plans and is monitored by individual bond 
project budgets.  The citizen bond oversight committee reviews all bond project budgets and expenditure 
reports. 
 
ACKNOWLEGEMENTS 
 

We would like to express appreciation to all the members of the Finance department who assisted with 
the preparation of this comprehensive annual financial report.  Our goal is to continuously improve our 
financial accountability to our citizens.   
 
We would also like to thank the members of the Board of Education for their interest and support in 
conducting the financial affairs of the district in a responsible and progressive manner. 
 
Respectfully submitted,

FINANCIAL SECTION:  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Our discussion and analysis of the financial performance of Independent School District No. I-1, Tulsa 
Public Schools, (“district”), provides an overview of the district’s financial activities for the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 2018.  The intent of this management discussion and analysis is to look at the district’s 
financial performance as a whole; readers should also review the financial statements and notes to the 
basic financial statements to enhance their understanding of the district’s financial performance. 
 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 
At fiscal 2018 year end, total fund balance was $168.3 million, an increase of  $9.3 million, primarily due 
to an increase of $6.2 million in cash and investments, $11.0 million increase in receivables, offset by 
decrease of $5.9 million in succeeding year property taxes and $2.7 million decrease in accounts 
payable.  Bond proceeds of $71 million was $1.2 million greater than proceeds in fiscal 2017.  The district 
issues these debt offerings to further fund capital improvements and acquisitions while our overall credit 
rating remained strong.  The district was given a “AA” rating by Standard and Poor’s for the general 
obligation bonds issued during the year. 
 
OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the district’s basic financial 
statements, which comprise three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund financial 
statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report also contains other supplementary 
information in addition to the basic financial statements. 
 
Government-wide financial statements – The government-wide financial statements are designed to 
provide readers with a broad overview of the district’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector 
business. 
 
The statement of net position presents information on all of the district’s assets plus deferred outflows of 
resources and liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported 
as net position.  Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of 
whether the financial position of the district is improving or deteriorating.   
 
The statement of activities presents information showing how the district’s net position changed during 
the most recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event 
giving rise to the change occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  Thus, revenues and 
expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal 
periods (e.g., uncollected taxes). 
 
The government-wide financial statements outline functions of the district that are principally supported by 
property taxes and intergovernmental revenues.  The activities of the district include instruction, support 
services - student and staff, operation and maintenance of plant facilities, student transportation, and 
operation of non-instructional services.  Examples of the types of expenses that can be found in these 
categories include: 
 

Instruction – costs associated with activities that deal directly with the interaction between 
students and teachers. 
Support services – student and staff – includes costs for activities that serve as adjuncts for 
fulfilling the objectives of instruction such as counseling, social work, testing, health services, 
psychological service, speech pathology, library, and professional development for instructional 
staff. 
Instructional and school leadership – costs associated with the overall general administrative 
responsibility for a single school or group of schools, including principals, deans and assistant 
principals, and school office support. 



 
FINANCIAL SECTION:  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 

 

 28 

Administrative support services – includes costs such as the superintendent’s office, board of 
education and related support, legal, audit, budgeting, accounting and financial reporting, payroll, 
human resource functions, purchasing, warehouse support, information services and 
communications, centralized printing services, and community relations. 
Non-instructional services – includes costs for child nutrition (cafeteria). 
Operation and maintenance of plant services – costs for utilities, grounds upkeep, custodial, 
security, building repairs and maintenance that do not meet capitalization thresholds or criteria, 
and the servicing and maintenance of school vehicles other than school buses. 
Student transportation services – costs associated with transporting students including drivers, 
bus maintenance and depreciation, fuel, and transportation administration. 

 
The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 39 and 40 of this report. 
 
Fund financial statements – A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control 
over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.  The district uses fund 
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.  Because the 
focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is 
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  By doing so, readers may better 
understand the long-term impact of the district’s near-term financing decision.  Both the governmental 
fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund 
balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and 
governmental activities.  These reconciliations are on pages 42 and 44, respectively. 
 
The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 41 and 43 of this report. 
 
Notes to the financial statements – The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full 
understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements.  The notes to 
the financial statements can be found on pages 46 through 74 of this report. 
 
Other information – In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report 
also presents certain required supplementary information concerning the district’s budget process.  The 
district adopts an annual expenditure budget for all governmental funds.  A budgetary comparison 
schedule has been provided for the general fund as required supplementary information.  Required 
supplementary information also includes the district’s contributions to Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement 
System and the district’s proportionate share of the net pension liability.  The required supplementary 
information can be found on pages 77 through 82 of this report. 
 
GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
Net position may serve as a useful indicator of a government’s financial position over time.  In the case of 
the district, assets plus deferred outflows of resources exceeded liabilities plus deferred inflows of 
resources by $228.6 million as of June 30, 2018 compared to $202.0 million as of June 30, 2017, an 
increase of $26.6 million, or 13.2%.  This increase is primarily due to $23.2 million increase in capital 
assets, $11.0 million increase in receivables, offset by $4.8 million increase in bonds, capital leases and 
contracts, and $5.9 million increase in succeeding year property taxes. 
 
The largest portion of the district’s net position reflects its investment in capital assets (e.g. land, 
buildings, vehicles, fixtures and equipment, and construction in progress), net of accumulated 
depreciation plus deferred inflows/outflows of resources (if applicable) less any related debt used to 
acquire those assets still outstanding.  The district uses these capital assets to provide services to its 
students; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending.  Although the district’s 
investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that the resources 



 
FINANCIAL SECTION:  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

 

 

 29 

needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves 
cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. 
 
The district’s financial position is the product of several types of financial transactions including the net 
results of activities, the acquisition and payment of debt, the acquisition and disposal of capital assets, 
and the depreciation of capital assets. 
 
A summary of the district’s net position is presented below: 
 

Statement of Net Position at June 30,
2018 2017

Current assets $ 364.0         $ 298.4      
Non current investments 44.2           92.0

Unrestricted (211.6)        (215.5)     

Total net position $ 228.6         $ 202.0      

(millions)

 
 
Several significant current year transactions had an impact on the statement of net position, and include 
the following:   
 

 Non-current assets decreased $47.8 million over 2017, primarily due to moving more of our 
investments into shorter-term favorable yields.   

 Deferred outflows decreased $43.7 million, deferred inflows increased $25 million and net 
pension liability decreased $68.2 million over prior year. 

 
Changes in net position.  The district’s total revenues were $425.7 million, an increase of $10.4 million 
from the prior fiscal year total of $415.3 million primarily due to increased property tax collections of $13.6 
million.  The total cost of all programs and services was $399.0 million and $400.1 million for the fiscal 
years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  This increase of $17.5 million reflects the emphasis 
of instruction and instruction-related services which represented $14.6 million of the increase and by $5.2 
million increase in administrative support services.

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF DISTRICT’S FUNDS 
 
As noted earlier, the district uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-

Governmental funds.  The focus of the district’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-
term inflow, outflows, and balances of expendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the 
district’s financing requirements.  In particular, the unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful 
measure of the district’s net resources available for spending at the end of the year. 
 
These funds are reported using the modified accrual method of accounting, which measures cash and all 
other financial assets that can be readily converted to cash. These statements provide a detailed short-
term view of the school district’s operations and the services it provides. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial 
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar 
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing 
so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing 
decisions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund statement of revenues, 
expenditures, and changes in fund balance provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between 
governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
The district’s fund financial statements provide detailed information about the most significant funds—not 
the district as a whole. The district’s governmental funds use the following accounting approach. All of the 
district’s services are reported in governmental funds. Governmental fund reporting focuses on showing 
how money flows into and out of funds and the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. 
They are reported using modified accrual accounting, which measures cash and all other financial assets 
that can readily be converted to cash. The governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term 
view of the district’s operations and the services it provides.

BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
The district’s budget is prepared according to Oklahoma law and is based on accounting for certain 
transactions in appropriated funds on the basis of cash receipts, disbursements, and encumbrances.  The 
most significant budgeted fund is the general fund, which, including the fund balance, represented 54% of 
all original budgets of appropriated funds. Only the general fund is discussed below. 
  
For 2018, the district originally budgeted general fund revenues of $289.5 million and expenditures of 
$294.7 million.  Plans were revised and an amended budget was filed in April 2018.  The revised budget 
increased revenue expectations to $294.0 million and increased projected expenditures to $297.0 million. 
 
Actual revenue on a budgetary basis for the general fund was $0.2 million more than projected. 
 
Actual expenditures for the year were $2.7 million below the final budget, primarily due to: 

 Purchased services actual expenditures were $5.0  million less than expected primarily due to 
expenditures in several areas being less than expected: 

o Professional, technical and rental services were $3.8 million less than expected 
o Travel was $.4 million less than expected 
o Other purchased services was $.7 million less than expected 

 Supplies actual expenditure was $3.0  million less than expected primarily due to expenditures in 
several areas being less than expected: 

o Cleaning, paper and general supplies were $1.1 million less than expected 
o Co-curricular supplies were $1.7 million less than expected

Total fund balances - governmental funds $ 168,312        

The cost of capital assets purchased or constructed is reported as an expenditure
in the governmental funds. The Statement of Net Position includes those capital
assets among the assets of the District as a whole.  Capital assets used  
in governmental activities are not financial resources and therefore are not reported 
as assets in governmental funds.

Land $ 5,017          
Construction in progress 44,104        
Assets out of service 2,422          
Buildings 856,073      
Furniture and equipment 71,735        
Accumulated depreciation (393,651)     585,700        

Long-term liabilities, including bonds payable, are not due and payable in the 
current period and therefore are not reported as governmental fund liabilities.
Interest payable on debt and other long-term obligations is also not recorded
in the governmental funds but is reported in the Statement of Net Position.  
All liabilities, both current and long-term, are reported in the Statement of
Net Position.  Liabilities not reported as governmental fund
liabilities include:

Bonds, capital leases and contracts $ (257,863)     
Interest payable (1,737)       

Compensated absences (7,543)         
Net pension liability (268,340)     
Insurance claims (9,418)         (544,901)       

Other long-term assets are not available to pay for current period expenditures
and, therefore, are reported as unavailable revenue in the governmental funds. 6,308            

Pension related deferred outflows and inflows are not due and payable in the
current period, therefore, they are not reported in governmental funds.

Deferred pension plan outflows 52,943          
Deferred pension plan inflows (39,810)

Amounts reported for governmental activities and the statement of activities 
are different because:

Net changes in fund balances - total governmental funds 9,252  $               

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in governmental funds as
expenditures.  However, for governmental activities, those costs are shown in the 
statement of net position and allocated over their estimated useful lives as annual
depreciation expense in the statement of activities.  This is the amount by which the
capital outlays exceeded depreciation and retirements in the period.

Capital outlays 55,000                 
Depreciation expense (30,680)                24,320                 

The effect of miscellaneous transactions involving capital assets. 
Proceeds from the sale of capital assets (883)                     
Loss on sale of capital assets (286)                     (1,169)                  

Repayments of principal on long-term debt are expenditures in the governmental funds but
reduce long-term liabilities in the statement of net position and do not affect the statement
of activities.  Also, governmental funds report the effect of  premiums, discounts,
and similar items when debt is first issued, whereas these amounts are deferred
and amortized in the statement of activities. Proceeds from the sale of new bonds 
are other financing sources in the governmental funds but have no impact on the 
statements of activities.

Principal payments and amortization of bond premium 67,602                 
Proceeds from the sale of bonds, capital leases, and premium on the issuance of bonds (72,416)                
Capital lease payments 42                        
Change in accrued interest payable (256)                     (5,028)                  

Because some revenues (property taxes and certain other income) will not be collected for 
several months after the District’s fiscal year ends, they are not considered as “available” 
revenues in the governmental funds and are instead deferred inflows of resources. 
They are, however, recorded as revenues in the statement of activities. (102)                     

Some expenses (compensated absences, insurance claims, and pension expense)
reported in the statement of activities do not require the use of 
current financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures in (708)                     
governmental funds.

Note 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation 
The financial statements of the district have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America as applied to government units as promulgated by the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), the accepted standard-setting body for 
governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more significant of the district’s 
accounting policies are described below.   
 
Reporting Entity 
The district is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and 
is, accordingly, a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The general operating 
authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma 
Statutes. The district is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and 
control of the state Board of Education. The district is the primary government that has a separately 
elected governing body, is legally separate and is fiscally independent of other state or local 
governments.  The governing body of the district, the Board of Education, is composed of elected 
members.  The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the district.  
 
As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the basic 
financial statements present the reporting entity which consists of the primary government, organizations 
for which the primary government is financially accountable, and other organizations for which the nature 
and significance of their relationship with the primary government are such that exclusion could cause the 
district’s basic financial statements to be misleading. The district has not identified any organizations that 
should be included in the district’s reporting entity. 
 
Basic Financial Statements 
The government-wide financial statements (i.e. the statement of net position and the statement of 
activities) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the district.  Essentially all interfund 
activity has been removed from these statements.   
 
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function is 
offset by program revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific 
function.  Indirect expenses of other functions are not allocated to those functions but are reported 
separately in the statement of activities.  Depreciation expense is specifically identified by function and is 
included in the direct expenses to each function.  Interest on general long-term debt is considered an 
indirect expense and is reported separately in the statement of activities.  Program revenues include 1) 
charges to customers or applicants who purchase, use or directly benefit from goods, services, or 
privileges provided by a given function and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the 
operational or capital requirements of a particular function.  Taxes and other items not properly included 
among program revenues are reported as general revenues. 
 
There are two categories of funds: governmental and fiduciary. Separate financial statements are 
provided for governmental funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from the 
government-wide financial statements.  Major individual governmental funds are reported as separate 
columns in the fund financial statements.  All remaining governmental funds are aggregated and reported 
as nonmajor funds.

Funds 

The district reports its financial activities through the use of fund accounting.  This is a system of 
accounting wherein transactions are reported in self-balancing sets of accounts to reflect results of 
activities.  Fund accounting segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is used to aid 
management in demonstrating compliance with finance-related legal and contractual provisions.  The 
minimum number of funds is maintained, consistent with legal and managerial requirements.  There are 
two categories of funds:  governmental and fiduciary. 

Governmental Funds 
Governmental funds are those through which most governmental functions typically are financed.  
Governmental fund reporting focuses on the sources, uses and balances of current financial resources.  
Expendable assets are assigned to the various governmental funds according to the purposes for which 
they may or must be used.  Current liabilities are assigned to the fund from which they will be paid.  The 
difference between governmental fund assets and liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources is reported 
as fund balance.   
 
All governmental funds can be classified into one of five types: the general fund, capital projects funds, 
debt service funds, special revenue funds and permanent funds.  In the fund financials, data from each 
major fund is presented in a separate single column while data from all the nonmajor funds are 
aggregated into a single column. 
 
The following are the district’s major governmental funds: 
 

General fund – The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those 
required to be accounted for in another fund.  The general fund includes the accounts and activities of 
the workers compensation fund.  Combining schedules are included to show the separate accounting 
for workers compensation and general fund.  Major revenue sources include state and local property 
taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program.  Expenditures include all 
costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for programs funded for building 
repairs and maintenance, school construction, and debt service on bonds and other long-term debt.  
The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific 
programs. 

Capital projects fund – The capital projects fund is comprised of the district’s bond funds and is 
used to account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, 
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, acquiring 
transportation, equipment, textbooks and classroom learning materials. 

Debt service fund – The debt service fund is the district’s sinking fund and is used to account for the 
accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt (including judgments) 
principal, interest, and related costs.  The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied 
specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments.

The following are the district’s nonmajor governmental funds: 

Special revenue funds – Special revenue funds are used to account for specific revenue sources 
that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditures for particular purposes. 

Building fund – The building fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for 
the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing 
furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for school district property, for 
paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and 
casualty insurance premiums for school facilities, and for purchasing security systems. 

Child nutrition fund – The child nutrition fund consists of monies derived from federal and state 
financial assistance and food sales.  This fund is used to account for the various nutrition 
programs provided to students.   

Gifts fund – The gifts fund receives its assets by way of philanthropic foundations, individuals, or 
private organizations for which no repayment or special service to the contributor is expected.  
This fund is used to promote the general welfare of the district. 

Flexible benefit fund – The flexible benefit fund is used to account for forfeited amounts received 
from the third-party administrator of the district’s cafeteria plan.  These funds must be used for 
administering employee benefit programs. 

Arbitrage rebate fund – The arbitrage rebate fund is used to pay the rebatable arbitrage of certain 
bond issues to which the Internal Revenue Service arbitrage rules apply.  These funds will either 
be retained or transferred to the Internal Revenue Service, depending on future financial events 
and computations.  There was no activity in this fund during the year ended June 30, 2018. 

Permanent fund – Permanent funds are used to report resources that are legally restricted to the 
extent that only earnings, not principal, may be used for purposes that support the government’s 
program. 

Endowment fund – The Texaco endowment scholarship fund accounts for an endowment whose 
earnings are restricted to expenditures for awarding college scholarships to Memorial high school 
graduates. 

Fiduciary Funds 
As of June 30, 2018, the fiduciary fund category was comprised entirely of agency-type funds.  Agency 
funds are custodial in nature (assets equal liabilities) and do not involve measurement of results of 
operations.  The district’s agency funds account for monies collected principally through fundraising 
efforts of the students and district sponsored groups. Fiduciary funds are not included in the government-
wide financial statements. 

Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation 
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement 
focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the fiduciary fund financial statements.  The economic 
resources measurement focus is not applicable to the agency funds (which comprise the entire fiduciary 
fund category) and therefore have no measurement focus.  Revenues are recorded when earned and 
expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows.  
Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are budgeted.  Grants and similar 
items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider have 
been met.

Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources measurement 
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting.  All sources of revenues are recognized as soon as 
they are both measurable and available.  Revenues are considered to be available when they are 
collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period.  For 
this purpose, the district considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end 
of the current fiscal period.  Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under 
accrual accounting.  However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated 
absences, pension, claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. 
 
All sources of revenue associated with the current fiscal year are considered to be susceptible to accrual 
and so have been recognized as revenues of the current fiscal year to the extent the availability criteria 
discussed above was met. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The district considers all cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments with original 
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents.   

Investments 
Investments consist of United States Treasury securities and agencies and certificates of deposit. 
Investments, except for non-negotiable certificates of deposit, are recorded at fair value. See note 3 for 
discussion regarding fair value measurements. The investment income including the net change in fair 
value of investments is recognized and reported as earnings (loss) on investments. Non-negotiable 
certificates of deposit are recorded at cost.   

Inventories and Prepaid Items 
All inventories are valued at average cost using the first-in, first-out method.  Inventories of governmental 
funds are recorded as expenditures when consumed rather than when purchased. 
 
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as 
prepaid items in both the government-wide and fund financial statements.  These prepaid items are 
recorded as expenditures/expenses when consumed rather than when purchased. 

Capital Assets 
Capital assets, which include land, building, building improvements, construction in progress, equipment, 
vehicles and fixtures are reported in the government-wide financial statements.  Capital assets are 
recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed.  The capitalization 
threshold for buildings and building improvements is $10,000, while for equipment and fixtures it is 
$5,000.  Donated capital assets are recorded at acquisition value at date of donation.  As capital assets 
are identified as surplus, they are reclassified as assets out of service.  Assets out of service are recorded 
at the lower of carrying amount or fair value.   
 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially 
extend asset lives are not capitalized. 
 
Building and building improvements of the district are depreciated using the straight-line method 
beginning in the year they are placed in service.  Equipment, vehicles, and fixtures are depreciated using 
the straight-line method beginning in the month acquired.  The district’s capital assets have the following 
estimated useful lives:

 Assets Years 
 Buildings and building improvements 20-50 
 Equipment, vehicles and fixtures 5-15 

Pensions 

The net pension liability, deferred inflows and outflows of resources related to pensions, pension 
expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System 
(OTRS) and additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the 
same basis as reported by OTRS.  For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee 
contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.  Investments 
held by OTRS are reported at fair value.  

Deferred Outflows of Resources 

In addition to assets, the statement of net position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred 
outflows of resources.  This separate financial statement element represents a consumption of net 
position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an outflow of resources 
(expense/expenditure) until then.  Deferred outflows of resources for the year ended June 30, 2018 
consist of unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense and contributions from the employer 
after the measurement date but before the end of the employer’s reporting period. See note 11 for 
additional discussion regarding pension deferred outflows of resources. 

Deferred Inflows of Resources 

In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position and fund balance sheet will sometimes report a 
separate section for deferred inflows of resources.  This separate financial statement element represents 
an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow 
of resources (revenue) until then.  The governmental fund balance sheet includes deferred inflows of 
resources related to unavailable local sources of revenues and succeeding year property taxes. These 
amounts are deferred and recognized as an inflow of resources in the period that the amounts become 
available or the period levied for and budgeted.  In the district’s government-wide statements, the 
property tax revenues for the succeeding year remain a deferred inflow and will be recognized as revenue 
in the year for which they are levied and budgeted for. The district’s government-wide statements also 
consist of unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense. See note 11 for additional discussion 
regarding pension deferred inflows of resources.    

Compensated Absences 
The district reports compensated absences in accordance with the provisions of GASB Statement No. 16, 
Accounting for Compensated Absences.  Vacation leave is accrued as a liability as the benefits are 
earned by the employees if the employees’ rights to receive compensation are attributable to services 
already rendered and it is probable that the district will compensate the employees for the benefits 
through paid time off or some other means, such as cash payments at termination or retirement.  Sick 
leave is calculated using the vesting method.  The balance reflects sick leave accumulated at the balance 
sheet date by those employees who are currently eligible to receive termination payments as well as 
other employees who are expected to become eligible in the future to receive such payments.  The 
accrual has been reduced to the maximum amount allowed by the district’s policy as a termination 
payment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Year ended June 30, 2018 

 
Note 1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) 
 

 

 51 

The liability for such leave is reported as incurred in the government-wide financial statements.  A liability 
for those amounts is recorded in the governmental funds only if the liability has matured as a result of 
employee resignations or retirements. 

Accrued Compensation 

Salaries, wages, and benefits that have been earned but not paid as of the end of the fiscal year are 
reported as a liability on the fund balance sheet and statement of net position.  The district has three pay 
cycles.  Employees on each cycle, including teachers, render services under their various contracts prior 
to the end of the fiscal year for which they do not receive payment until after the end of the fiscal year.  
The total gross amount of salaries, wages, and benefits associated with these services is reported as a 
liability on the financial statements.     

Long-term Liabilities 
In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported 
as liabilities in the statement of net position.  Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized 
over the life of the bonds using the effective interest method.  Bonds payable are reported net of 
applicable bond premium or discount.  Bond issuance costs are reported as current year expenditures. 
 
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as 
bond issuance costs, as current period activity.  The face amount of debt issued is reported as other 
financing sources.  Premiums received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources, while 
discounts on debt issuances are reported as other financing uses.  Issuance costs, whether or not 
withheld from the actual debt proceeds received are reported as current year expenditures.  Principal and 
interest payments are recorded as debt service expenditures. 

Net Position and Fund Balances 
The government wide financial statements utilize a net position presentation.  Net position on the 
statement of net position include the following: 
 

Net investment in capital assets – the component of net position that reports the difference 
between capital assets less both the accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balance of debt, 
excluding unexpended proceeds, that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or 
improvement of those assets.  Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that 
are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets or related debt are 
also included in this component of net position, if any. 

Restricted for specific purposes – the component of net position that reports the difference 
between assets plus deferred outflows of resources and liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources 
of certain programs should be reported when constraints placed on the use of resources are either 
(a) externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other 
governments or (b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.  The 
restricted net position for other purposes is made up of the following (000’s):  child nutrition fund 
$4,224; gifts fund $1,339; flexible benefit fund $2; endowment fund $30; and federal and state 
allocation carryover $615. 

Unrestricted – the difference between the assets plus deferred outflows of resources and liabilities 
plus deferred inflows of resources that is not reported in net invested in capital assets or net position 
restricted for specific purposes.

 52 

It is the district’s policy to first use restricted resources prior to the use of unrestricted resources when an 
expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted resources are available. 
 
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance.  Fund balance refers to the difference between 
assets and liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources in the governmental funds balance sheet.  Fund 
balance consists of five categories, defined in GASB Statement No. 54, as follows: 
 

Nonspendable fund balance: The nonspendable fund balance classification includes amounts that 
cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually 
required to be maintained intact. This would include items not expected to be converted to cash 
including inventories, long-term receivables, and prepaid amounts. It may also include the long-term 
amount of loans and receivables, as well as property acquired for resale and the corpus (principal) of 
a permanent fund. 

Restricted fund balance: The restricted fund balance classification should be reported when 
constraints placed on the use of resources are either (a) externally imposed by creditors, 
grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or (b) imposed by law through 
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.   

Committed fund balance:  The committed fund balance classification reflects specific purposes 
pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the district's Board of Education.  Such 
constraints can only be removed or changed by the same form of formal action. 

For purposes of committed fund balance, the district’s Board of Education is considered to be its 
highest level of decision making.  Funds set aside by the Board of Education as committed fund 
balance requires a resolution by the Board of Education.  Such resolution must be made prior to 
the district’s fiscal year-end in order for it to be applicable to the district’s fiscal year-end, although 
it is permitted for the specific amount of the commitment to be determined after the fiscal year-end 
if additional information is required in order to determine the exact amount to be committed.  The 
Board of Education has the authority to remove or change the commitment of funds by resolution.  
The district had no committed fund balance at June 30, 2018. 

Assigned fund balance: The assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts that are 
constrained by the government’s intent to be used for specific purposes, but meet neither the 
restricted nor committed forms of constraint.  Assigned funds cannot cause a deficit in unassigned 
fund balance. 

For the purposes of assigned fund balance, the district has by resolution given authority to its chief 
financial officer to assign funds for specific purposes.  Any funds that the chief financial officer 
assigns for specific purposes must be reported to the Board of Education at its next regular 
meeting.  The assignment of funds shall be recorded in the Board of Education’s official meeting 
minutes.  Unlike commitments, assignments generally only exist temporarily.  In other words, an 
additional action does not normally have to be taken for the removal of an assignment. 

Unassigned fund balance: The unassigned fund balance classification is the residual 
classification for the general fund only. It is also where negative residual amounts for all other 
governmental funds would be reported. Unassigned fund balance essentially consists of excess 
funds that have not been classified in the four above fund balance categories.

When expenditures are incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted resources is 
available, it is the district’s policy to use restricted fund balance first. When expenditures are incurred for 
purposes for which amounts in any of the unrestricted resources classifications can be used, it is the 
district’s policy to use amounts classified as committed first, followed by amounts classified as assigned 
and then amounts classified as unassigned. 

District’s Use of Estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States requires the district to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources and disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenditures during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted 
The GASB has issued several new accounting pronouncements which will be effective to the district in 
fiscal years ending June 30, 2020 and 2021. A description of the new accounting pronouncements are 
described below: 

 
 Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities 

GASB Statement No. 84 issued February 2017 will be effective for the district beginning with its fiscal 
year ending June 30, 2020.  The objective of Statement No. 84 is to improve guidance regarding the 
identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial reporting purposes and how those 
activities should be reported. This statement establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all 
state and local governments. The focus of the criteria generally is on (1) whether a government is 
controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and (2) the beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary 
relationship exists. Separate criteria are included to identify fiduciary component units and 
postemployment benefit arrangements that are fiduciary activities. 

An activity meeting the criteria should be reported in a fiduciary fund in the basic financial statements. 
Governments with activities meeting the criteria should present a statement of fiduciary net position 
and a statement of changes in fiduciary net position. An exception to that requirement is provided for 
a business-type activity that normally expects to hold custodial assets for three months or less. This 
statement describes four fiduciary funds that should be reported, if applicable: (1) pension (and other 
employee benefit) trust funds, (2) investment trust funds, (3) private-purpose trust funds, and (4) 
custodial funds. Custodial funds generally should report fiduciary activities that are not held in a trust 
or equivalent arrangement that meets specific criteria. 

A fiduciary component unit, when reported in the fiduciary fund financial statements of a primary 
government, should combine its information with its component units that are fiduciary component 
units and aggregate that combined information with the primary government’s fiduciary funds. 

This statement also provides for recognition of a liability to the beneficiaries in a fiduciary fund when 
an event has occurred that compels the government to disburse fiduciary resources. Events that 
compel a government to disburse fiduciary resources occur when a demand for the resources has 
been made or when no further action, approval, or condition is required to be taken or met by the 
beneficiary to release the assets.

 Statement No. 87, Leases 

GASB Statement No. 87 issued June 2017 will be effective for the district beginning with its fiscal 
year ending June 30, 2021. Statement No. 87 establishes a single approach to accounting for and 
reporting leases by state and local governments. Under this statement, a government entity that is a 
lessee must recognize (1) a lease liability and (2) an intangible asset representing the lessee’s right 
to use the leased asset. In addition, the district must report the (1) amortization expense for using the 
lease asset over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the underlying asset, (2) 
interest expense on the lease liability and (3) note disclosures about the lease. The statement 
provides exceptions from the single-approach for short-term leases, financial purchases, leases of 
assets that are investments, and certain regulated leases. This statement also addresses accounting 
for lease terminations and modifications, sale-leaseback transactions, non-lease components 
embedded in lease contracts (such as service agreements), and leases with related parties. 

 
The district is currently evaluating the impact these new standards may have on its financial statements.

Note 2.  REVENUES 
 
A description of the district’s revenue sources is included below.  Revenue is recognized as described 
below in the government-wide statements and as described below, to the extent the availability criteria 
has been met, in the governmental fund statements. 

Property Taxes  
The district is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real 
and personal property within the district.  These property taxes are distributed to the district’s general, 
building fund and debt service funds based on the levies approved for each fund.  The district receives 
property taxes from four counties.  The county assessor for each county, upon receipt of the certification 
of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax rolls for submission to the 
county treasurer prior to October 1.  The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen 
days of receipt of the tax rolls.  The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1.  The second half is due 
prior to April 1.  
 
If the first payment is not made in a timely manner, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 
2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment.  If not 
paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due.  The owner 
has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  If at the end of two years 
the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.  
 
Property tax receivables are recorded on the lien date, January 1st, although the related revenue is 
reported as a deferred inflow of resources and will not be recognized as revenue until the year for which it 
is budgeted.  An allowance for uncollectible property taxes is calculated based on historical collection 
data. 

Intermediate Revenues  
Revenue from intermediate sources is the amount of money collected by an intermediate administrative 
unit, or a political subdivision between the district and the state, and distributed to districts in amounts that 
differ in proportion to those which are collected within such systems.  Revenue is recognized when it is 
both measurable and available. 

Fees and Charges  
Fees and charges include tuition, fees, rentals, disposals, commissions, and reimbursements.  These are 
recorded as revenue when services are provided. 

State Revenues 
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid formula under 
the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, of the Oklahoma Statutes.  The state Board of Education 
administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the 
districts.  Revenue is recognized when eligibility requirements have been met. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the state Department of Education 
may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review.  
Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions from or additions to the revenue of the year when 
the adjustment is made. 
 
The district receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs.  State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the 
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the 



 
FINANCIAL SECTION:  BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Year ended June 30, 2018 

 

 

 56 

Note 2.  REVENUES (continued) 
 
fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs.   
 
As of June 30, 2018 $0.5 million of state revenue was carried forward into fiscal year 2019.  The state 
Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund. 

Federal Revenues  
Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form of operating grants, 
entitlements, or commodities.  An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific purpose, 
activity or facility.  A grant may be received either directly from the federal government or indirectly as a 
pass through from another government, such as the state. 
 
Revenue is recognized when eligibility requirements have been met.  Expenditure-driven grants are 
recognized as revenue when the qualifying expenditures have been incurred and all other eligibility 
requirements have been met.   
 
Federal rules require that revenue earmarked for federal programs be expended only for the program for 
which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year 
be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  As of June 
30, 2018 $0.1 million of federal revenue was carried forward into fiscal year 2019. 
 
The majority of federal revenues received by the district are apportioned to the general fund.  The district 
maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the federal revenues received for the child nutrition 
programs are apportioned there.

Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits 
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of bank failure, the district may not be able to recover its 
deposits. Deposits are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured and uncollateralized. The 
district’s policy requires that all deposits in excess of amounts covered by federal deposit insurance be 
fully collateralized by the entity holding the deposits.  As of June 30, 2018, all of the district’s deposits 
were either covered by insurance or were collateralized at 110% of the investment principal.  Collateral 
was held by the pledging financial institution’s trust department or agent in the district’s name. 

Custodial Credit Risk - Investments 
For an investment, custodial credit risk is the risk that the district will not be able to recover the value of its 
investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Investment securities 
are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured, are not registered in the name of the district, 
and are held by counterparty or the counterparty’s trust department but not in the name of the district.  
The district’s policy requires that all investments in excess of amounts covered by federal deposit 
insurance be fully collateralized by the entity holding the investments.  As of June 30, 2018, all of the 
district’s investments were either covered by federal deposit insurance or were fully collateralized. 
Further, all of the district’s investments are held by its agent in the district’s name. Accordingly, no 
investments are subject to custodial credit risk. 

Credit Risk 
The district’s fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk. However, the district policy on credit quality 
limitations upholds a very high standard by limiting investments to either direct obligations of the US 
government or investments backed 110% by collateral.  At June 30, 2018, the district’s investment 
portfolio had invested $78.0 million in mortgage-backed securities, which are considered agency 
securities of the U.S. government and therefore carry the same credit ratings of the government.  The 
credit ratings of the agency securities are Moody’s Aaa, Standard and Poor AA+, and Fitch AAA.  The 
remaining $82.0 million is invested in certificates of deposit which are not subject to credit risk. 

Concentration of Credit Risk 
The district’s investment policy requires that, except for direct obligations of the U.S. government, its 
agencies or instrumentalities, or certificates of deposit secured by diversified pledges of collateral, the 
district’s investment portfolio will be diversified to avoid incurring undue concentration in securities of one 
type.  At June 30, 2018, all investments were in agency securities of the U.S. government or certificates 
of deposit.  The concentration of the investments are listed below. 

Interest Rate Risk   
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an 
investment.  The district’s investment policy limits the duration of investments to a maximum maturity from 
the date of purchase of sixty months, provided that sufficient liquidity is available to meet the district’s 
major cash outlays.  The district monitors investment performance on an ongoing basis to limit the 
district’s interest rate risk.  As of June 30, 2018, all of the district’s investments were scheduled to mature 
in 5 years or less.

Investment Maturities (in Years)

 
 
The district's investment policy is adopted in accordance with the provisions of applicable law by the 
board of the district. This policy sets forth the investment policy for the management of the public funds of 
the district. The policy is designed to ensure prudent management of public funds, the availability of funds 
when needed, and reasonable investment returns.  

Fair Value Measurements 

GASB Statement No. 72 provides guidance for determining a fair value measurement for reporting 
purposes and applying fair value to certain investments and disclosures related to all fair value 
measurements. The district categorizes its fair value measurement within the fair value hierarchy 
established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs 
used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets; level 2 inputs are inputs—other than quoted prices included within level 1—that are 
observable for an asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: a) quoted prices for 
similar assets or liabilities in active markets; b) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in 
markets that are not active; and c) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or 
liability, such as: (1) interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals; (2) implied 
volatilities and (3) credit spreads. Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs.  

As of June 30, 2018, all of the district’s investments are valued using level 2 inputs.  The value is 
determined using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Investment Authority  
The district treasurer is required by the board to invest district monies in the custody of the treasurer in 
those investments permitted by law. The treasurer shall, to the extent practicable, use competitive bids  
when purchasing direct obligations of the United States Government or other obligations of the United 
States Government, its agencies, or instrumentalities.

 59 

The district treasurer shall limit investments to:  
 Direct obligations of the United States government to the payment of which the full faith and credit 

of the government of the United States is pledged; provided the district treasurer, after completion 
of an investment education program in compliance with applicable law, may invest funds in the 
investment account in other obligations of the United States government, its agencies or 
instrumentalities;  

 Obligations to the payment of which the full faith and credit of the state is pledged;  
 Certificates of deposits of banks when such certificates of deposits are secured by acceptable 

collateral as defined in this policy.  
 Savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations to the extent that such 

accounts or certificates are fully insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation;  
 Repurchase agreements that have underlying collateral consisting of those items specified above 

including obligations of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, and where the 
collateral has been deposited with a trustee or custodian bank in an irrevocable trust or escrow 
account established for such purposes;  

 County, municipal or school district direct debt obligations for which an ad valorem tax may be 
levied or bond and revenue anticipation notes, money judgments against such county, 
municipality or school district ordered by a court of record or bonds, or bond and revenue 
anticipation notes issued by a public trust for which such county, municipality or school district is 
a beneficiary thereof. All collateral pledged to secure public funds shall be valued as defined in 
this policy.  

 Money market mutual funds regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and which 
investments consist of obligations of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities, and 
investments in those items and those restrictions specified in this policy;  

 Warrants, bonds or judgments of the district;  
 Qualified pooled investment programs through an interlocal cooperative agreement formed 

pursuant to applicable law and to which the board has voted to be a member, the investments of 
which consist of those items specified in this policy, as well as obligations of the United States 
agencies and instrumentalities; or  

 Any other investment that is authorized by law.  

Investment Philosophy  
This policy shall be based upon a “prudent investor” standard. The board recognizes that those charged 
with the investment of public funds act as fiduciaries for the public, and, therefore the treasurer is directed 
to exercise the judgment and care that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise 
in the management of their own affairs as to the permanent nonspeculative disposition of their funds, with 
due consideration of probable income earnings and probable safety of capital. In investing the district’s 
funds, the treasurer shall place primary emphasis, first, on safety and liquidity of principal, and then on 
earnings.  

 Liquidity: Available funds will be invested to the fullest extent practicable in interest-bearing 
investments or accounts, with the investment portfolio remaining sufficiently liquid to meet 
reasonably anticipated operating requirements.  

 Diversification: The investment portfolio will be diversified to avoid one class of investment 
causing a disproportionate risk of loss to the portfolio. Provided this restriction will not apply to 
direct obligations of the United States government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or certificates 
of deposit secured by diversified pledges of collateral as provided this policy.  

 Safety of principal: Although investments are made to produce income for the district, 
investments will be made in a manner that preserves principal and liquidity.

 Prohibition of speculation: The purchase of an investment to be sold before its maturity will 
normally result in either a gain or loss for the district and is therefore “speculative” by definition. 
This practice is prohibited.  

 Yield: The portfolio will be designed to attain maximum yield within each class of investment 
instrument, consistent with the safety of the funds invested and taking into account investment 
risk and liquidity needs.  

 Maturity: Investments will be purchased with expectation that they will be held to maturity.  
Investments in the sinking fund may have maturities extending to 60 months.  Investments in all 
other funds may have maturities extending to 36 months, provided sufficient liquidity is available 
to meet major outlays, and except that general fund investments may not exceed 18 months. Any 
investment collateralized by a pledge of a surety bond or letter of credit as permitted by OAC 735, 
Chapter 20, may not have a maturity date after the expiration of the surety bond or letter of credit.  

 Capability of investment management: The superintendent shall be responsible for seeing that 
the treasurer and any assistant treasurer are qualified and capable of managing the investment 
portfolio and satisfactorily complete any investment education programs required by state law or 
by the board.  

 Collateral: Securities pledged to the district to secure investments shall be limited to the type and 
terms acceptable to the treasurer of the State of Oklahoma under the Oklahoma Administrative 
Code Title 735, Chapter 20. Such securities shall be diversified as to type and maturity. Such 
securities shall be valued at no more than market value and such pledged value shall be at least 
110 percent of the investment principal being secured on the date of the pledge. Changes in the 
market value of the pledged securities occurring during the life of the pledge that would cause the 
value of the pledge to be less than 110 percent of the principal being secured shall be 
supplemented by the pledgor with additional securities. The treasurer shall have the authority to 
sign forms and contracts with financial institutions or the Federal Reserve to enter into 
agreements for the safekeeping of collateral.

Note 7.  CAPITAL LEASES 
 
The district records lease agreements that qualify as capital leases for accounting purposes at the 
present value of their future minimum lease payments at their inception date.  The present value has 
been calculated based on the district’s incremental borrowing rate at time of inception unless the lessor’s 
implicit interest rate is known and lower. 
 
On July 5, 2016, the District entered into an agreement with BlueMark Solutions LLC (BMS) to upgrade 
the compressed natural gas (CNG) pump station at the East transportation lot for $3.5 million.  Under the 
agreement, BMS will offset the cost of the compressed natural gas equipment with federal income tax 
credits which lower the district’s cost by approximately $0.8 million.  The district will exercise a purchase 
option of $2.4 million after 39 months. 
 
On August 24, 2017, the District entered into an agreement with Midwest Transport Solutions LLC for the 
acquisition of 18 compressed natural gas (CNG) buses, of which the natural gas conversion equipment 
on each bus will be leased for 39 months before being paid in full.  This arrangement allows Midwest 
Transport Solutions to pass along to the District a federal income tax credit creating a 6% savings on the 
total price of each bus.  The district will exercise a purchase option of $202 thousand after 39 months.

Note 8.  LONG-TERM DEBT 

2015 School Bond 
On March of 2015 the electors approved authority for the issuance of $415 million in combined purpose, 
general obligation school bonds which include $239.7 million for building construction and repairs; $19.8 
million for library additions, renovations and materials; $17 million for transportation; and $138.4 million 
for text books and classroom learning materials. 

As of June 30, 2018 $158.3 million has been issued leaving $256.7 million remaining for future issuances.  

Current year Combined Purpose Bond issuances (Series 2017B and 2018A) 
In August 2017 and March 2018, the district issued $44.0 and $27.0 million respectively in bonds.  The 
proceeds from these bonds will be used to construct and renovate school facilities, for library 
improvements, transportation equipment, and to acquire classroom materials and technology. 

Bonds sold at discounts decrease the carrying value of the bond, and bonds sold at a premium increase 
the carrying value. The discount or premium is then amortized as an increase or decrease, respectively, 
to the coupon interest payment in reporting interest expense. The district uses the effective interest rate 
method for amortizing premiums and discounts. Amortization expense on bond premiums for the year 
ended June 30, 2018 is approximately $1.2 million. The net amount of unamortized premium at June 30, 
2018 was approximately $3.3 million.

Note 9.  RISK MANAGEMENT 
 
The district is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters for which the government carries commercial 
insurance.  Commercial policies in force during the year contained the following deductibles: 
 

Property, fire and extended coverage 
Charter school locations 
Windstorm and hail (1% per occurrence, per building)

 $   100,000 
75,000 

100,000 up to 1,500,000
Automobile liability  175,000
General liability  175,000
Inland marine  2,500
School leader legal  175,000
Cyber liability and breach response  25,000

 
Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in any of 
the past three fiscal years. 
 
The district is self-insured for workers’ compensation claims.  Premiums are paid into the workers’ 
compensation fund, which is combined with the general fund for purposes of financial statement 
presentation, from the general fund and child nutrition fund.  Liabilities are reported in the government-
wide statements when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be 
reasonably estimated.  Liabilities are reported in the general fund statements to the extent these amounts 
are payable with expendable available financial resources.  Liabilities in the government-wide statements 
also include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR).  The result of this 
process to estimate the claims liability is not an exact amount as it depends on many complex factors, 
such as inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and damage awards.  Accordingly, claims are reevaluated 
periodically to consider the effects of inflation, recent claim settlement trends (including frequency and 
amount of pay-outs), and other economic and social factors.  The estimate of the claims liability also 
includes amounts for incremental claim adjustment expenses related to specific claims and other claim 
adjustment expenses regardless of whether allocated to specific claims.  For example, estimated 
recoveries from salvage or subrogation are another component of the claims liability estimate.  An excess 
coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $1,000,000 up to the statutory limit.  
Settlements did not exceed coverage for the past three years.   
 
At June 30, 2018, the district had established liabilities for workers compensation claims and deductibles 
on commercial coverage of $8.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. Changes in the balances of claims 
liability for the past three years are as follows (000’s): 
 

2018 2017 2016
Unpaid claims, beginning of year $     9,890 $   12,442 $   14,471 
Incurred claims (including IBNRs)     3,485     1,946     2,486 
Claim payments   (3,863)   (4,498)   (4,515)
Unpaid claims, end of year $     9,512 $     9,890   12,442 

 
 
Approximately $3.1 million of the amount unpaid at June 30, 2018 is expected to be paid out in the next 
fiscal year from general funds.

Note 10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
 
Encumbrance accounting is utilized to assure effective budgetary control and accountability and to 
facilitate effective cash planning and control.  Encumbrances represent commitments related to 
unperformed contracts for goods or services.  At year end the amount of encumbrances expected to be 
honored upon performance by the vendor in the next year were as follows (000’s): 
 

General Fund $     5,972 
Capital Projects Fund   26,477 
Nonmajor Funds     1,577 
Total $   34,026 

 
 

Amounts received or receivable from grant agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor 
agencies, principally the federal government.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts already 
collected, may constitute a liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures that may 
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the district expects such 
amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 
The district is a defendant in various lawsuits.  Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, in the opinion of the district’s counsel, the resolution of these matters will not have a 
material adverse effect on the financial condition of the district. 
 
 
Note 11.  PENSION BENEFITS 

Plan description 
The district participates in the OTRS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system 
that is self-administered. OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and 
beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are established and may be amended by the legislature of the State of 
Oklahoma. Title 70 of the Oklahoma State Statutes assigns the authority for management and operation 
of OTRS to the Board of Trustees of the OTRS. OTRS issues a publicly available annual financial report 
that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS/. 

 
Participation in the plan is required for certified teachers and administrators.  Other permanent, support 
employees working at least half time are eligible for participation in the plan at their option.  At June 30, 
2018, there were 3,104 active employees of the district participating in the plan, comprising 4% of the 
total teacher’s retirement system participants. 

Benefits provided 
OTRS provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final compensation, age, and term of 
service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon disability and to survivors upon the 
death of eligible members. Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 defines all retirement benefits. The authority to 
establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the state legislature. 
 
Benefit provisions include: 

 Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years of credited 
Oklahoma service. Members who joined OTRS on June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire at 
maximum benefits when age and years of creditable service total 80. Members joining OTRS after 
June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their age and years of creditable service total 

 



 
FINANCIAL SECTION:  BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Year ended June 30, 2018 

 
Note 11.  PENSION BENEFITS (continued) 
 

 

 69 

90. Members whose age and service do not equal the eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as 
early as age 55, and at age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on their years of service. The 
maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2 percent of final compensation for each year of credited 
service. 

 
 Final compensation for members who joined OTRS prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as the average 

salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for members joining OTRS 
after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive years of annual 
compensation in which contributions have been made. The final average compensation is limited for 
service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, depending on the member’s 
election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits accumulated after June 30, 1995 
are calculated based on each member’s final average compensation, except for certain employees 
of the two comprehensive universities. Upon the death of a member who has not yet retired, the 
designated beneficiary shall receive the member’s total contributions plus 100 percent of interest 
earned through the end of the fiscal year, with interest rates varying based on time of service. A 
surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect to receive, in lieu of the aforementioned benefits, 
the retirement benefit the member was entitled to at the time of death as provided under the joint 
survivor benefit option. 

 
 Upon the death of a retired member, OTRS will pay $5,000 to the designated beneficiary, in addition 

to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the member. 
 
 A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. The disability 

benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable years of credited service. 
 
 Upon separation from OTRS, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based on certain 

restrictions provided in the plan, or by the IRC. 
 
 Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program up to the 

exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b). 

Contributions  
The contribution requirements of OTRS are at an established rate determined by Oklahoma statute and 
are not based on actuarial calculations. Employees are required to contribute 7 percent of their annual 
compensation. The district’s contribution rate is 9.5 percent for the year ended June 30, 2018. In addition, 
the district is required to match the state’s contribution rate on salaries that are paid with federal funds.  
The district’s total contribution to OTRS in 2018 was $16.5 million.  
 
The state makes a contribution on behalf of each teacher meeting minimum salary requirements (known 
as the OTRS years of service credit). The credit amount is determined based on years of service and 
ranges from $60.15 per year for 0 years of service to $1,410.53 per year for 25 years or more of service. 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the state paid approximately $1.6 million on behalf of teachers 
employed at the district. In accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, the district 
recognized the on-behalf-of payments as revenue and expense/expenditure in the government wide and 
fund financial statements.  
 
The State of Oklahoma is also required to contribute to the system on behalf of the participating 
employers. For 2018, the State of Oklahoma contributed 5 percent of state revenues from sales and use 
taxes and individual income taxes, to the system on behalf of participating employers. The district has 
estimated the amounts contributed to the system by the State of Oklahoma on its behalf based on a 



 
FINANCIAL SECTION:  BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Year ended June 30, 2018 

 
Note 11.  PENSION BENEFITS (continued) 
 

 

 70 

contribution rate provided to the district. For the year ended June 30, 2018, the total amount contributed 
to the system by the State of Oklahoma on behalf of the district was approximately $12.4 million.  In 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, district recognized the on-behalf payments as 
revenue and expenditures in the fund financial statements.  In government-wide statement of activities, 
revenue is recognized for the state’s on-behalf contribution on an accrual basis of approximately $11.3 
million.  

These on-behalf payments do not meet the definition of a special funding situation. 

Pension liabilities, pension expense, and deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows 
of resources related to pensions  
At June 30, 2018, the district reported a liability of $268.3 million for its proportionate share of the net 
pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017 and the total pension liability 
used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017. 
The district’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the district’s contributions to OTRS 
relative to total contributions of OTRS for all participating employers for the year ended June 30, 2017. 
Based upon this information, the district’s proportion was 4.05267515%.  The change in proportion from 
the June 30, 2016 measurement date was a decrease of 0.02002713%. 

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the district recognized pension expense of $28.2 million. At June 30, 
2018, the district reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to 
pensions from the following sources:

Deferred pension outflows totaling $16.5 million resulting from the district’s contributions subsequent to 
the measurement date, will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended 
June 30, 2019. Net deferred outflows resulting from the difference between projected and actual earnings 
on pension plan investments will be recognized in pension expense over five years as of the beginning of 
each measurement period.  Other deferred inflows and outflows are being amortized over a closed period 
equal to the average of the expected service lives of all employees as of the beginning of the 
measurement period.  Other amounts reports as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

Actuarial assumptions  
The total pension liability as of June 30, 2017 was determined based on an actuarial valuation prepared 
as of June 30, 2017 using the following actuarial assumptions: 

 Actuarial cost method—Entry age normal 
 Inflation—2.50 percent 
 Future ad hoc cost-of-living Increases—None 
 Salary increases—Composed of 3.25 percent wage inflation, including 2.50 percent price inflation, 

plus a service related component ranging from 0.00 percent to 8.00 percent based on years of 
service.  

 Investment rate of return—7.50 percent 
 Retirement age—Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted by 

the board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five year experience study for the period ending June 
30, 2014. 

 Mortality rates after retirement—Males: RP-2000 Combined Health Mortality Table for males with 
white collar adjustments.  Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from 
the table’s base year of 2000.  Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, scaled 
at 105%.  Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the table’s base 
year of 2012.  

 Mortality rates for active members—RP-2000 Employee Mortality tables, with male rates multiplied 
by 60 percent and female rates multiplied by 50 percent. 

 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building block 
method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of 
pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges 
are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates 
of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. 

The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return for each major 
asset class as of June 30, 2017, are summarized in the following table:

Total 100%

**The Real Estate total expected return is a combination of US Direct Real Estate (unlevered) and US Value added Real Estate (unlevered)

 
 
Discount  Rate  
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.5 percent, no change from prior year. 
This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on pension plan investments of 
7.5 percent. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan 
member and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level 
percentage of payroll. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the state’s contribution plus the 
matching contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five 
years of actual contributions. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, OTRS’ 
fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future 
benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension 
plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension 
liability. 

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate  
The following table presents the net pension liability of the district calculated using the discount rate of 7.5 
percent, as well as what the district’s net pension liability would be if OTRS calculated the total pension 
liability using a discount rate that is 1-percentage point lower (6.5%) or 1-percentage point higher (8.5%) 
than the current rate:

Note 12.  COMPENSATED ABSENCES 

Sick Pay Benefits 
The district provides sick pay benefits for all of its permanent employees, and all employees entitled to 
sick leave are permitted to accrue unlimited unused leave.  Upon termination, employees who have been 
employed by the district for at least ten years are paid for any unused sick leave on a graduated scale.  
After twenty years of service, both certified and support employees are paid $30 per day for any unused 
service. 

Vacation Benefits 
Permanent employees on twelve-month contracts accrue vacation on a graduated scale from 10 to 20

Note 14.  TAX ABATEMENT DISCLOSURES 
 
The City of Tulsa provides ad valorem tax abatements to promote development within an enterprise zone 
in downtown Tulsa. The district is impacted by tax abatements provided by the City of Tulsa under the 
Tax Incentive District Number One economic development program.  The abatements were established to 
encourage the development, renovation and redevelopment of residential, both single-family and multiple-
unit dwellings, as well as commercial retail space and hotels. The abatements up to 100 percent of the 
additional property tax resulting from the increase in assessed value as a result of the improvements, are 
administered as a reduction in the tax bill, and last for up to 6 years (or fewer, if the property is sold). The 
district participates in the ad valorem tax abatement of 55.2%.  For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, 
the City of Tulsa had five active agreements which resulted in a total tax abatement of approximately 
$261,500, of which the district’s share is approximately $144,400, and ten other agreements which are 
currently under construction and will not result in tax abatements until such time that the project is 
completed and the ad valorem taxes are developed by the Tulsa County Tax Assessor. In all cases of the 
five active agreements, the district receives ad valorem taxes at the market value of the property prior to 
the abatement.   
 
The State of Oklahoma grants a 5-year exemption of ad valorem taxes for certain new manufacturing or 
research and development equipment and facilities.  Pursuant to Section 193 of Title 62 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes, the state will reimburse the district for foregone property taxes as a result of this exemption.  
During the year ended June 30, 2018, the amount of foregone tax revenues as a result of this exemption 
were $3,839,571.  The state reimbursed the district $3,839,571 during the year ended June 30, 2018 in 
connection with the abated tax revenues.

NOTES TO THE REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 

Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 
Note 1.  BUDGETS AND BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING 
 

BUDGETARY COMPARISON SCHEDULE 
A cash basis of accounting is used to prepare the budgetary comparison schedule.  A reconciliation from 
the cash basis to the modified accrual basis of accounting, which is generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP), is presented on the face of the schedule. 

BUDGET LAW AND PRACTICE 
The board of the district has elected to prepare and present budgets under the Oklahoma School District 
Budget Act.  The district superintendent directs the preparation of the budget proposal and submits it to 
the board.  The board holds a public hearing on the proposed budget within 45 days preceding the start of 
the budget year.  Notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, together with the proposed budget 
summary, is published in the Tulsa Daily Commerce and Legal News at least 5 days before the public 
hearing.  The budget is also available upon request from the district’s chief financial officer.  At the public 
hearing on the budget, any person may present to the board comments, recommendations or information 
on any part of the proposed budget. 
 
Once adopted, the budget must be in effect no later than the first day of the fiscal year to which it applies.  
The budget as adopted and filed with the Oklahoma state auditor and inspector constitutes an 
appropriation for each fund which may not be used for any other purpose except as provided by law. 
 
The district presents the budget in four funds: the general fund, capital projects fund, debt service fund 
and the special revenue fund which includes the child nutrition and building funds.  Budgetary control for 
accounts without a project is generally at the full account level.  For accounts within a project the 
budgetary control is generally maintained by fund, project and site.  The district superintendent or 
designee may transfer an unexpended and unencumbered appropriation from one account to another 
within the same fund.  Line item transfers that are not original budget items in excess of $25,000 require 
board approval.  Whenever the necessity for maintaining any special fund of a school district has ceased 
to exist and a balance remains in the fund, the governing body may authorize the transfer of the balance 
to the general fund.  Applicable law governs the use or transfer of any remaining balance in the debt 
service or capital projects fund. 
 
The district board amends the original budget after the prior fiscal year financial activity has been 
finalized, the annual state aid allocation has been released, federal fund allocations are identified, and the 
property tax valuations have been certified for all affected counties within the district; generally between 
December and February of the fiscal year. 

ENCUMBRANCES 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.  
Encumbrance accounting, under which purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for the 
expenditure of resources are recorded to reserve that portion of the applicable appropriation, is utilized in 
the governmental funds.  Encumbrances outstanding at year-end are included in the “actual” amounts 
shown expended during the year for the budgetary presentation but are excluded from the fund balances 
in the governmental fund financial statements as they do not constitute expenditures or liabilities because 
the commitments will be honored during the subsequent year. 

REVENUES 
Revenues are recorded on a cash basis and include deposits to district accounts from the first day 
through the last day of the fiscal year regardless of when they were actually earned.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial 
Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters 

Based on an Audit of Financial Statements Performed  
in Accordance with Government Auditing Standards 

 
Independent Auditor's Report 

 
 
To the Board of Education 
Tulsa Public Schools 
Tulsa, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Tulsa Public Schools (the 
District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, 
which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon 
dated December 13, 2018. 
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal 
control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination 
of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement 
of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe 
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
 



 

2 

Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on 
the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with 
those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be 
reported under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program;  
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance; and Report on  

Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards 
Required by the Uniform Guidance  

 
Independent Auditor's Report 

 
 
To the Board of Education 
Tulsa Public Schools 
Tulsa, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Tulsa Public Schools’ (the District) compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect 
on each of the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District’s major 
federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule 
of findings and questioned costs. 
 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Office Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and Uniform Guidance require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the 
types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a 
major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the 
District’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, the District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the District’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
District’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. 
 
Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by Uniform Guidance  
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the 
aggregate remaining fund information of the District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial 
statements. We issued our report thereon dated December 13, 2018, which contained unmodified 
opinions on those financial statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on 
the financial statements that collectively comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required 
by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is 
the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting 
and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, 
and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all 
material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

The District has elected not to use the 10 percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform 
Guidance.
