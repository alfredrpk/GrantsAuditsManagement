INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Skiatook School District No. 1-007 
Skiatook, Oklahoma 74070 

Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory basis of Skiatook 
School District No. 1-007, Skiatook, Oklahoma (the "District") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes 
to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as described in Note 1, to meet the financial reporting 
requirements of the State of Oklahoma. This includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis 
for the preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to 
provide a basis for our modified audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by the Skiatook School District No. 1-007, on the basis of the 
financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of 
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although 
reasonably determined, are presumed to be material. 

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the previous paragraph, the basic financial statements referred 
to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States

of America, the financial position of the Skiatook School District No. 1-007, Tulsa County, Oklahoma as of June 30, 2018, or 
the revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed assets account group, which is a departure from the 
regulatory basis of accounting prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be recorded 
in the general fixed asset account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to in 
the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances arising from regulatory basis 
transactions of each fund type and account group of the District as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures 
paid and encumbered, of each fund type, for the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I. 

Other Matters 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that collectively comprise the 
District's basic financial statements. The combining fund statements, regulatory basis, listed in the accompanying table of 
contents are presented for purpose of additional analysis, and are not a required part of the basic fmancial statements. The 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The combining statements-regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of 
management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial 
statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other 
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, 
the combining statements-regulatory basis are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements 
as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report dated December 31, 2018, on our 
consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain provisions 
of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of 
our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an 
opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed 
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance.

INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 1-7, TULSA COUNTY 
NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The basic financial statements of the Skiatook Public Schools Independent District No. 1-7 
(the "District") have been prepared in conformity with another comprehensive basis of 
accounting as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The more 
significant of the District's accounting policies are described below. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. 

The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction 
and control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on state of 
Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public school system is the 
Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected 
members. The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has 
considered all potential component units. The decision to include a potential component 
unit in the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The basic, but not the only, criterion 
for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body's 
ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this 
ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the ability to exercise 
oversight responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, 
the designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations, and 
accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in evaluating potential 
component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion involves 
considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the 
activity is conducted within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally 
available to its patrons. A third criterion used to evaluate potential component units for 
inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing 
relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight 
responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential 
component units included in the District's reporting entity. The Parent Teacher 
Association (PTA) is not included in the reporting entity. The District does not appoint any 
of the board members or exercise any oversight authority over the PTA.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - REGULATORY BASIS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

B. Fund Accounting 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results 
of its operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid 
financial management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or 
activities. 

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account 
group, on the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability 
for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not 
directly affect net expendable available financial resources. Funds are classified into three 
categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided into 
separate "fund types." 

Governmental Fund Types 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general 
activities, including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue 
funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and 
the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except 
those required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state 
and local property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid 
Program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools 
except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and 
debt service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and 
state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are the District's building, co-op and 
child nutrition funds. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists of monies derived property taxes levied 
for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school buildings 
and for purchasing furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for 
the school district property, for paying energy and utility costs, for purchasing 
telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty insurance premiums for 
school facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of security 
personnel.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

B. Fund Accounting - contd. 

Co-op Fund - The co-op fund is established when the boards of education of two or 
more school districts enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs. 
The revenues necessary to operate a cooperative program can come from federal, 
state, or local sources, including the individual contributions of participating school 
districts. The expenditures for this fund would consist of those necessary to operate 
and maintain the joint programs. The District did not maintain this fund during the 
2017-18 fiscal year. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The child nutrition fund consists of monies derived from 
federal and state financial assistance and food sales. This fund is used to account for 
the various nutrition programs provided to students. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's sinking fund and is used to 
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term 
(including judgments) debt principal, interest and related costs. The primary revenue 
sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings 
from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Funds - The capital projects fund is the District's bond fund and is used to 
account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, 
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and 
acquiring transportation equipment. 

Proprietary Fund Types 

Proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in the private 
sector, where the determination of net income is necessary or useful to sound financial 
administration. Goods or services from such activities can be provided either to outside 
parties (enterprise funds) or to other departments or agencies primarily within the District 
(internal service funds). The District has no proprietary fund types. 

Fiduciary Fund Types 
Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including 
other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are 
held under a trust agreement, either a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund 
is used depending on whether there is an obligation to maintain trust principal. Agency

funds are used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent 
and do not involve measurement of results of operations. 

Expendable Trust Funds - Expendable trust funds include the gifts fund, medical insurance 
fund, worker's compensation fund and the insurance recovery fund. The District did not 
maintain any expendable trust funds in the 2017 -18 fiscal year. 

Gifts Fund - The gifts fund receives its assets by way of philanthropic foundations, 
individuals, or private organizations for which no repayment or special service to the 
contributor is expected. This fund is used to promote the general welfare of the 
District. 

Medical Insurance Fund - The medical insurance fund accounts for revenues and 
expenditures for all types of self-funded medical insurance coverage. 

Workers Compensation Fund - The worker's compensation fund accounts for 
revenues and expenditures for worker's compensation claims. 

Insurance Recovery Fund - The insurance recovery fund accounts for all types of 
insurance recoveries, major reimbursements and reserves for property repairs and 
replacements. 

Agency Fund - The agency fund is the school activities fund which is used to account for 
monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the student and District- 
sponsored groups. The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, in 
collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Group 
Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to 
establish accounting control over long-term debt and fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account 
for all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt 
service fund and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the 
debt principal. It is also used to account for other liabilities (judgments and lease 
purchases), which are to be paid from funds provided in future years.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

General Fixed Assets Account Group - This account group is used by governments to 
account for the property, plant and equipment of the school district. The District does not 
have the information necessary to include this group in its financial statements. 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the combined financial statements - regulatory basis is captioned 
"memorandum only" to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. 
Data in this column does not present financial position, results of operations or cash flows 
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Neither is such data 
comparable to a consolidation. Inter-fund eliminations have not been made in the 
aggregation of this data. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally 
accepted form of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective 
date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management's Discussion 
and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. This format significantly differs from that 
required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education (OSDE) as follows: 

Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 
the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 
Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased. 
Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 
obligation is incurred.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation - contd. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become 
available and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be 
recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when 
revenues are earned and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget 
must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning 
the following July 1. If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District 
must hold an election on the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If the 
preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. If an 
election is held and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal 
budget. If voters reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the 
approved tax rate. 

The District may upon approval by a majority of the electors of the District voting on the 
question make the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local support levy permanent. 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal budget is required for all funds except for trust 
and agency funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved 
budgeted appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for 
supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. 

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Balances 

Cash - Cash consists of cash on hand, demand deposit accounts, and interest-bearing 
checking accounts. 

Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States Government 
and agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, bank and trust 
companies; savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, and 
trust companies; and warrants, bonds or judgments of the district. All investments are 
recorded at cost, which approximates market value.

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Balances - contd. 

Inventories - The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the 
combined financial statements-regulatory basis. 

Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment - The General Fixed Asset Account Group 
is not presented. 

Warrants Payable - Warrants are issued to meet the obligations for goods and services 
provided to the District. The District recognizes a liability for the amount of outstanding 
warrants that have yet to be redeemed by the District's treasurer. 

Encumbrances - Encumbrances represent commitments related to purchase orders, 
contracts, other commitments for expenditures or resources, and goods or services received 
by the District for which a warrant has not been issued. An expenditure is recorded and a 
liability is recognized for outstanding encumbrances at year end in accordance with the 
regulatory basis of accounting. 

Urunatured Obligations - The unmatured obligations represent the total of all annual 
accruals for both principal and interest, based on the lengths of the bonds and/or judgments, 
less all principal and interest payments through the balance sheet date in accordance with 
the regulatory basis of accounting. 

Funds Held for School Organizations - Funds held for school organizations represent the 
funds received or collected from students or other co-curricular and extracurricular 
activities conducted in the district, control over which is exercised by the board of 
education. These funds are credited to the account maintained for the benefit of each 
particular activity within the school activity fund. 

Long- Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a govermnental fund when 
due, or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early 
in the following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be 
financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a 
govermnental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general 
long-term debt account group. Long-term liabilities expected to be financed from 
proprietary fund operations are accounted for in those funds. 

Cash Fund Balance - Cash fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase 
order, legal contracts, outstanding warrants and unmatured obligations.

F. Revenue and Expenditures 

Local Revenues - Revenue from local sources is the money generated from within the 
boundaries of the District and available to the District for its use. The District is authorized 
by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal 
property within the District. These property taxes are distributed to the District's general, 
building and sinking funds based on the levies approved for each fund. The County 
Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, 
extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer prior to October 
1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the 
tax rolls. The first half of taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to 
Aprill. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 
2. Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of 
assessment. If not paid by the following October l, the property is offered for sale for the 
amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes 
and penalty owned. If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is 
issued a deed to the property. 

Other local sources of revenues include interest earnings, tuition, fees, rentals, disposals, 
commissions and reimbursements. 

Intermediate Revenues - Revenue from intermediate sources is the amount of money from 
funds collected by an intermediate administrative unit, or a political subdivision between 
the district and the state and distributed to districts in amounts that differ in proportion to 
those which were collected within such systems. 

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed 
by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school 
districts based on information accumulated from the Districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State 
Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for 
prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally such adjustments are treated as reductions 
or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

F. Revenue and Expenditures- contd. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these 
programs be expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require 
that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the 
following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of 
Education requires categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund. 

The aforementioned state revenues are apportioned to the District's general fund. 

Federal Revenues - Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in 
the form of operating grants or entitlements. An operating grant is a contribution to be 
used for a specific purpose, activity or facility. A grant may be received either directly 
from the federal government or indirectly as a pass-through from another government, such 
as the state. 

An entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant to an 
allocation formula contained in applicable statutes. 

The majority of the federal revenues received by the District are apportioned to the general 
fund. The District maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the federal revenues 
received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

Non-Revenue Receipts - Non-revenue receipts represent receipts deposited into a fund that 
are not new revenues to the District, but the return of assets. 

Instruction Expenditures - Instruction expenditures include the activities dealing directly 
with the interaction between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students 
in a school classroom, in another location, such as a home or hospital, and in other learning 
situations, such as those involving co-curricular activities. It may also be provided through 
some other approved medium, such as television, radio, telephone and correspondence. 
Included here are the activities of teacher assistants of any type (clerks, graders, teaching 
machines, etc.), which assist in the instructional process. The activities of tutors, 
translators and interpreters would be recorded here. Department chairpersons who teach 
for any portion of time are included here. Tuition/transfer fees paid to other LEAs would 
be included here.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 

F. Revenue and Expenditures - contd. 

Support Services Expenditures - Support services expenditures provide administrative, 
technical (such as guidance and health) and logistical support to facilitate and enhance 
instruction. These services exist as adjuncts for fulfilling the objectives of instruction, 
community services and enterprise programs, rather than as entities within themselves. 

Operation of Non-Instructional Services Expenditures - Activities concerned with 
providing non-instructional services to students, staff or the community. 

Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services Expenditures - Consists of activities 
involved with the acquisition of land and buildings; remodeling buildings; the construction 
of buildings and additions to buildings; initial installation or extension of service systems 
and other built-in equipment; and improvement to sites. 

Other Outlays/Uses Expenditures - A number of outlays of governmental funds are not 
properly classified as expenditures, but still require budgetary or accounting control. These 
are classified as Other Outlays. These include debt service payments (principal and 
interest) when applicable. Other uses include scholarships provided by private gifts and 
endowments; student aid and staff awards supported by outside revenue sources (i.e., 
foundations). Also, expenditure for self-funded employee benefit programs administered 
either by the District or a third-party administrator. 

Inter-fund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, 
expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or 
expenditure/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are 
recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

Repayment Expenditures - Repayment expenditures represent checks/warrants issued to 
outside agencies for refund or restricted revenue previously received for overpayment, non- 
qualified expenditures and other refunds to be repaid from District funds. 

All other inter-fund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, 
are reported as transfers. Nonrecurring or non-routine permanent transfers of equity are 
reported as residual equity transfers. All other inter-fund transfers are reported as operating 
transfers. There were no operating or residual equity transfers made during the 2017-18 
fiscal year.

revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond 
issues can be approved by the voters and issued by the District for various capital 
improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years of the 
date of issue. General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable and a capital 
lease. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from the fund balance and 
the future revenues of the debt service fund. 

General long-term debt of the District consists of building bonds payable and four (4)

4. Employee Retirement System 

Plan Description 
The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement Plan, a 
cost-sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system 
(PERS), which is administered by the board of trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers' 
Retirement System (the "System"). The System provides retirement and disability benefits, 
annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. 
Title 70 Section 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be 
amended only through legislative action. The Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System 
issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required 
supplementary information for the System. That report may be obtained by writing to 
Teachers' Retirement System of Oklahoma, P.O. Box 53524, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or 
by calling (405) 521-2387. 

Basis of Accounting 
The System's financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except 
for accruals of interest income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in 
which the contributions are made. Benefits and refunds are recognized when paid. The 
pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of 
pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated 
pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed 
to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no actuarial 
valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an under-funded 
pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation.

4. Employee Retirement System - contd. 

GASB Statement 68 became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2014, and 
significantly changes pension accounting and financial reporting for governmental 
employees who participate in a pension plan, such as the System, and who prepare 
published financial statements on an accrual basis using Generally Accepted Accounting 
Principles. Since the District does not prepare and present their financial statements on an 
accrual basis, the net pension liability amount is not required to be presented on the 
financial statements. The amount of calculated net pension liability for the District at June 
30,2017 (latest information available) was $13,671,097. 

Funding Policy 
The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make contributions. 
The contribution rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be 
amended by Oklahoma Statutes. The rates are not actuarially determined. The rates are 
applied to the employee's earnings plus employer-paid fringe benefits. The required 
contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation. Beginning, July 1, 
2010, the District and State were required to contribute 14.5% of applicable compensation. 
Contributions received by the System are from a percentage of its revenues from sales 
taxes, use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. The District 
contributed 9.5% beginning January 1, 2010 and the State of Oklahoma contributed the 
remaining 5.0% during the year. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher's 
Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating 
members. In addition, the District is required to match the retirement paid on salaries that 
are funded with federal funds. 

Annual Pension Cost 
The District's portion of the total contributions for 2018,2017 and 2016 were $895,971, 
$859,598, and $912,422 respectively. 

5. Contingencies 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment 
by grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may 
constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which 
may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the District 
expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.

6. Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and 
destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; and natural disasters. 
The District continues to carry commercial insurance for these risks, including general and 
auto liability, property damage, and public official's liability. Settled claims resulting from 
these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three 
fiscal years. 

7. Subsequent Events 

Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the audit report, which is 
the date the financial statements were available to be issued and have determined that no 
additional information needs to be added to the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Skiatook School District No. 1-007 
Skiatook, Oklahoma 74070 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory basis 
as listed in the Table of Contents, of Skiatook School District No. 1-007, Skiatook, Oklahoma, as of and for the year 
ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's 
basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 31, 2018. This report was adverse 
with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma 
school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards 
Board. However, our report was qualified for the omission of the general fixed asset account group with respect to 
the presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State 
Board of Education. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District's internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the District's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements 
will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough 
to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that 
we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of 
our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on 
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards 
in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 
other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH 
MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE 

REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Skiatook School District No. 1-007 
Skiatook, Oklahoma 74070 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited the compliance of Skiatook School District No. 1-007, Skiatook, Oklahoma, with the types 
of compliance requirements described in the Us. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance 
Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year 
ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's 
results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (The Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance 
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, Skiatook District No. 1-007, Skiatook, Oklahoma complied, in all material respects, with 
the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each 
of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
The management of Skiatook District No. 1-007, Skiatook, Oklahoma is responsible for establishing and 
maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred 
to above. In planning and performing our audit, we considered the District's internal control over 
compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal 
program to determine our auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing our opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal 
control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will 
not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control 
over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a 
type of compl iance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal 
control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform 
Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
