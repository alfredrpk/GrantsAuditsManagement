INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 

Board of Regents 

Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 

Oklahoma Panhandle State University 

Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Oklahoma Panhandle State University (the 

University), an organizational unit of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical 

Colleges (the Regents), which is a component unit of the State of Oklahoma, and its discretely presented 

component unit, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, 

which collectively comprise the University’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 

accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the 

design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation 

of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We did not audit 

the financial statements of the University’s discretely presented component unit, the Panhandle State 

Foundation (the Foundation). Those financial statements were audited by other auditors, whose report has 

been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Foundation, is 

based solely on the report of the other auditors. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing 

standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits 

contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. 

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 

the financial statements are free from material misstatement. The financial statements of the Foundation 

were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 

financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 

of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 

those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair 

presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 

circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 

control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 

accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, 

as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 

audit opinions.

Opinions 

In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of the other auditor, the financial statements referred to 

above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the University and its 

discretely presented component unit as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position, 

and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles 

generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Change in Accounting Principle 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2018 the University adopted new accounting guidance, 

GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 

Pensions. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Emphasis of Matter 

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements of the University are intended to present the financial 

position, the changes in financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows of only that portion of the 

Regents that is attributable to the transactions of the University. They do not purport to, and do not present 

fairly the financial position of the Regents as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position, or its 

cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 

States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter. 

Other Matters 

Required Supplementary Information 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s 

discussion and analysis and the schedules related to other postemployment benefits and pension liabilities 

and contributions be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although 

not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, 

who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in 

an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to 

the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 

United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the 

information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, 

the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial 

statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited 

procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 31, 2018, 

on our consideration of the University’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 

compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. 

The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting 

and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over 

financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance 

with Government Auditing Standards in considering the University’s internal control over financial 

reporting and compliance.

Oklahoma Panhandle State University 
(An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the  
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis- (Unaudited) 
Years Ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 

Introduction 

The discussion and analysis of Oklahoma Panhandle State University’s (the University) financial statements 
provides an overview of the University’s financial activities for the year ended June 30, 2018, with fiscal 
years 2017 and 2016 data presented for comparative purposes.  Since this discussion and analysis is 
designed to focus on current activities resulting in change and current known facts, it should be read in 
conjunction with the University’s basic financial statements and the footnotes. 

Financial Highlights 

During 2018, the University implemented GASB 75 Accounting and Financial Reporting for 
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions and restated its July 1, 2017 net position.  Due to the fact 
that complete prior year information was not available, no prior periods presented in the basic financial 
statements or in this MD&A have been restated for comparative purposes.  

Net Position: For the year ended June 30, 2018, the University’s net position decreased by $389,005 from 
actual operations and decreased by $1,129,417 as a result of the GASB 75 implementation for an overall 
decrease in net position of $1,518,422. The decrease was in unrestricted net position 

For the year ended June 30, 2017, the University’s net position increased by $60,951 from actual operations 
and decreased by $179,035 as a result of the GASB 73 implementation for an overall decrease in net 
position of $118,084. The decrease was in unrestricted net position 

Total Revenues: Total revenues decreased from $20,934,299 for the year ended June 30, 2017 to 
$20,476,152 for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The decrease was due mainly to decreases in 
appropriations due to state-wide revenue shortfalls. 

Total revenues decreased from $21,397,495 for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $20,934,299 for the year 
ended June 30, 2017.  The decrease was due mainly to decreases in appropriations due to state-wide 
revenue shortfalls and a decrease in overall financial aid revenue. 

Total Expenses: Total expenses decreased from $20,873,348 for the year ended June 30, 2017 to 
$20,865,157 for the year ended June 30, 2018. The decrease was a result of decreased compensation 
expense due to the accounting for the OTRS net pension obligation. 

Total expenses increased from $20,224,097 for the year ended June 30, 2016 to $20,873,348 for the year 
ended June 30, 2017. The increase was a result of increased compensation expense due to the accounting 
for the OTRS net pension obligation. 

Components of Net Position: At June 30, 2018, the University’s net position decreased to $3,253,609 from 
$4,772,031 at June 30, 2017, and $4,890,115 in 2016.  Graphically displayed, the comparative net position 
increases (decreases) by category for the three fiscal years are shown below:

Oklahoma Panhandle State University 
(An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the  
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges) 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis- (Unaudited) 
Years Ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 

Using This Annual Report 

The annual report consists of three basic financial statements:  the Statements of Net Position; the 
Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position; and the Statements of Cash Flows. 

The Statements of Net Position and the Statements of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Net Position 
report information on the University as a whole and on its activities.  When revenues and other support 
exceed expenses, the result is an increase in net position.  When the reverse occurs, the result is a 
decrease in net position.  The relationship between revenues and expenses may be thought of as the 
University operating results. 

These two statements report the University’s net position and changes in them.  The University’s net 
position - assets, plus deferred outflows of resources, less liabilities, less deferred inflows of resources, 
equals net position - is one way to measure the University’s financial health, or financial position.  Over 
time, increases or decreases in the University’s net position are one indicator of whether its financial health 
is improving or deteriorating.  The reader will need to consider many other non-financial factors, such as 
the trend and quality of applicants, freshman class size, student retention, condition of the buildings, and 
the safety of the campus, to assess the overall health of the institution. 

These statements include all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of 
resources using the accrual basis of accounting.  All of the current year’s revenues and expenses are taken 
into account regardless of when cash is received or paid. 

Statements of Net Position 

The following schedules were prepared from the University’s statements of net position, which are 
presented on an accrual basis of accounting. 

For the year ended June 30, 2018, compared to the year ended June 30, 2017, deferred outflows decreased 
and deferred inflows increased due to the changes in the OTRS net pension and OPEB obligation.

Statements of Cash Flows 

Another way to assess the financial health of an institution is to look at the Statements of Cash Flows.  Its 
primary purpose is to provide relevant information about the cash receipts and cash payments of an entity 
during a period.  The Statements of Cash Flows also helps users assess an entity’s ability to generate future 
net cash flows, its ability to meet its obligations as they come due, and its needs for external financing.

Summary of Net Position 

Although the statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position show a decrease in net 
position from operations of $389,005 during fiscal year 2018 this is representative of all activities combined. 
Management believes that it is important to point out the net change in net position for each major area of 
the University.  This is displayed below.

Component Unit 

Panhandle State Foundation (the Foundation) meets the criteria for inclusion as a discretely presented 
component unit of the University.  The most recent financial statements of the Foundation are included 
under the heading “Foundation”. 

Summary 

The University’s Educational & General Fund ended the year with a decrease of $300,559 in net position 
or 17.6%.  The University’s Educational & General Fund ended the year with net reserves of 11.8% of

The University ended fiscal year 2018 with an overall decrease of $1,518,422 in total net position.  This is 
a 31.8% decrease in overall net position.  This overall decrease in net position was the combination of a 
decrease from current year activity of $389,005 and a decrease as a result of the implementation of GASB 
75 of $1,129,417, which shows up in unrestricted net position. 

The fall 2018 enrollment for the University was a head count of 1,264, which is a 9.6% increase from the 
fall 2017 of 1,153.  This follows a decrease of 5.8% in headcount for the fall 2017 headcount of 1,153 over 
the fall 2016 headcount of 1,224.  Credit hours are up for the fall of 2018 from the fall of 2017 by 8.0% after

component unit of the State of Oklahoma. 
 
The Board of Regents has constitutional authority to govern, control and manage the Oklahoma Agricultural 
and Mechanical Colleges, which consists of Connors State College, Langston University, Northeastern 
Oklahoma A&M College, Oklahoma Panhandle State University and Oklahoma State University. This 
authority includes but is not limited to the power to designate management, the ability to significantly 
influence operations, acquire and take title to real and personal property in its name, and appoint or hire all 
necessary officers, supervisors, instructors, and employees for member institutions. 
 
Accordingly, the University is considered an organizational unit of the Oklahoma Agricultural and 
Mechanical Colleges reporting entity for financial reporting purposes due to the significance of its legal, 
operational and financial relationships with the Board of Regents, as defined in Section 2100 of the 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Codification of Governmental Accounting and 
Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
Component unit: Panhandle State Foundation (the Foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt 
component unit of the University. Although the University does not control the timing or amount of receipts 
from the Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, which the Foundation holds and invests 
is restricted to the activities governed by donors, bond documents and/or trustees. Accordingly, resources 
received and held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the University. The 
Foundation is considered a discretely-presented component unit of the University under the definition of 
GASB Statement No. 39. The Foundation has a December 31st year end and reports under Financial 
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). As such, certain revenue 
recognition criteria and presentation features are different from GASB revenue recognition criteria and 
presentation features. No modifications have been made to the Foundation’s financial information for these 
differences. The Foundation prepares separate, standalone financial statements which may be obtained by 
contacting the Foundation’s management. 
 
Financial statement presentation: The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) is the 
recognized standard setting body for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America (U.S. GAAP) applicable to public sector institutions of higher education. The University applies all 
applicable GASB pronouncements. 
 
Basis of accounting: For financial reporting purposes, the University is considered a special-purpose 
government engaged only in business-type activities. Accordingly, the University’s financial statements 
have been presented using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of 
accounting.   Under the accrual basis, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recorded 
when an obligation has been incurred. All significant intra-agency transactions have been eliminated.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Cash equivalents: For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the University considers all highly-liquid 
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Funds invested through 
the State Treasurer’s Cash Management Program are considered cash equivalents. 
 
Investments: The University accounts for its investments at fair value based on quoted market prices. 
Changes in unrealized gain (loss) on the carrying value of investments are reported as a component of 
investment income in the statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. 
 
Accounts receivable: Accounts receivable consist of tuition and fee charges to students and fees for 
auxiliary enterprise services provided to students, faculty, and staff, the majority of each residing in the 
State of Oklahoma. Accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated uncollectible amounts. The University 
determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts 
receivable are past due, the University’s previous loss history and the condition of the general economy 
and the industry as a whole. The University writes off specific accounts receivable when they become 
uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for 
doubtful accounts. 
 
A student account receivable and student loan receivable are considered to be past due if any portion of the 
receivable balance is outstanding for more than 90 days after the end of the semester. Late charges are 
generally assessed and, when they are assessed, are included in income and trade accounts receivable. 
Students may be granted a deferment, forbearance or cancellation of their student loan receivable based 
on eligibility requirements defined by the Department of Education. 
 
Accounts receivable also include amounts due from federal, state and local governments, or private 
sources, in connection with reimbursement of allowable expenditures made pursuant to the University’s 
grants and contracts. 
 
Inventories: Inventories consist primarily of rental books, books and supplies held for resale, and livestock. 
Rental books are valued at amortized cost, using an average three-year life. Books and supplies held for 
resale are valued at the lower of cost or market on the first-in, first-out basis. Livestock are valued at 
estimated current fair market value. 
 
Restricted cash and investments: Cash and investments that are externally restricted to make debt 
service payments, to maintain sinking or reserve funds or to purchase capital or other noncurrent assets 
are classified as restricted assets in the statements of net position. 
 
Capital assets: Capital assets are recorded at cost at the date of acquisition or fair market value at the 
date of donation, in the case of gifts. For equipment, the University’s capitalization policy includes all items 
with a unit cost of $5,000 or more and an estimated useful life of greater than one year. Renovations to 
buildings, infrastructure and land improvements that significantly increase the value or extend the useful 
life of the structure are capitalized. Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in 
the year in which the expense was incurred. 
 
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 
generally 15 to 40 years for buildings, infrastructure and land improvements, and 3 to 10 years for library 
materials and equipment.

(An Organizational Unit of the Board of Regents for the 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges) 
Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Unearned revenues: Unearned revenues include amounts received for tuition and fees and certain 
auxiliary activities prior to the end of the fiscal year but related to the subsequent accounting period. 
Unearned revenues also include amounts received from grant and contract sponsors that have not yet been 
earned. 
 
Compensated absences: Employee vacation pay is accrued at year-end for financial statement purposes. 
The liability and expense incurred are recorded at year-end as accrued vacation payable in the statements 
of net position and as a component of compensation and benefit expense in the statements of revenues, 
expenses and changes in net position. 
 
Noncurrent liabilities: Noncurrent liabilities include (1) principal amounts of revenue bonds payable, notes 
payable and capital lease obligations with contractual maturities greater than one year and (2) estimated 
amounts for accrued compensated absences and other liabilities that will not be paid within the next fiscal 
year. 
 
Use of estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures; accordingly, actual results could differ 
from those estimates. 
 
Net position: The University’s net position is classified as follows: 
 
Net investment in capital assets: The net investment in capital assets component of net position consists 
of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of bonds, notes or 
other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. 
Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or improvement of those assets or related debt are also included in this component of net 
position. To the extent debt has been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not 
included as a component of net investment in capital assets. 
 
Restricted net position - expendable: Restricted net position - expendable includes resources in which the 
University is legally or contractually obligated to spend resources in accordance with restrictions imposed 
by external third parties. 
 
Unrestricted net position: Unrestricted net position represents resources derived from student tuition and 
fees, state appropriations and sales and services of educational departments and auxiliary enterprises. 
These resources are used for transactions relating to the educational and general operations of the 
University and may be used at the discretion of the governing board to meet current expenses for any 
purpose. The included auxiliary enterprises are substantially self-supporting activities that provide services 
for students, faculty and staff. 
 
When an expense is incurred that can be paid using either restricted or unrestricted resources, the 
University’s policy is to first apply the expense towards restricted resources and then towards unrestricted 
resources. 
 
Income taxes: The University, as a political subdivision of the State of Oklahoma, is exempt from all federal 
income taxes under Section 115(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. However, the University 
may be subject to income taxes on unrelated business income under Internal Revenue Code Section 
511(a)(2)(B).

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 
Classification of revenues: The University has classified its revenues as either operating or nonoperating 
revenues according to the following criteria: 
 
Operating revenues: Operating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of exchange 
transactions, such as (1) student tuition and fees, net of scholarship discounts and allowances; (2) sales 
and services of auxiliary enterprises, net of scholarship discounts and allowances; (3) most federal, state 
and local grants and contracts; and (4) interest on institutional student loans. 
 
Nonoperating revenues: Nonoperating revenues include activities that have the characteristics of 
nonexchange transactions, such as gifts and contributions, student aid revenue and other revenue sources 
that are defined as nonoperating revenues by GASB Statement No. 9, Reporting Cash Flows of Proprietary 
and Nonexpendable Trust Funds and Governmental Entities That Use Proprietary Fund Accounting, and 
GASB Statement No. 34, such as state appropriations and investment income. 
 
Scholarship discounts and allowances: Student tuition and fee revenues, and certain other revenues 
from students, are reported net of scholarship discounts and allowances in the statements of revenues, 
expenses, and changes in net position. Scholarship discounts and allowances are the differences between 
the stated charge for goods and services provided by the University and the amount that is paid by students 
and/or third parties making payments on the students’ behalf. Certain governmental grants, such as Pell 
grants and other federal or state government or nongovernmental programs, are recorded as either 
operating or nonoperating revenues in the University’s financial statements. To the extent that revenues 
from such programs are used to satisfy tuition and fees and other student charges, the University has 
recorded a scholarship discount and allowance. 
 
Deferred outflows of resources: Deferred outflows are the consumption of net position by the University 
that are applicable to a future reporting period. The University’s deferred outflows of resources are 
comprised of deferred charges on an OCIA lease restructure and contributions to pensions and OPEB 
applicable to a future reporting period.   
 
Deferred inflows of resources: Deferred inflows are the acquisition of net position by the University that 
are applicable to a future reporting period. The University’s deferred inflows of resources were comprised 
of credits realized on an OCIA lease restructure and deferred inflows related to net pension and OPEB 
obligations. 
 
Pensions:  For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred 
inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position 
of the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary 
net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, 
benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in 
accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. 
 
Other Post-employment Benefits (OPEB):  For purposes of measuring the net OPEB liability (asset), 
deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB, and OPEB expense, 
information about the fiduciary net position of the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and 
additions to/deductions from OTRS’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as 
they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee 
contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are 
reported at fair value.

Prior Period Adjustments:  
 
Beginning net position for fiscal year 2018 was restated as follows: 
 

Fiscal Year 2018
Beginning net position, as previously reported 4,772,031$          

Implementation of GASB Statement No. 75 (1,129,417)          

Beginning net positions, restated 3,642,614$          

 
 
 
New accounting pronouncements adopted in fiscal year 2018: The University adopted the following 
new accounting pronouncements during the year ended June 30, 2017: 
 
GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than 
Pensions 
  
GASB No. 75 was issued in June 2015, and addresses accounting and financial reporting for OPEB that 
is provided to the employees of state and local governmental employers. This Statement establishes 
standards for recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of 
resources, and expense/expenditures. For a defined benefit OPEB, this Statement identifies the methods 
and assumptions that are required to be used to project benefit payments, discount projected benefit 
payments to their actuarial present value, and attribute that present value to periods of employee service. 
Note disclosure and required supplementary information requirements about defined benefit OPEB 
also are addressed. The University’s Health Insurance Benefit Plan is subject to this new standard and as 
a result, the College’s beginning net position as of July 1, 2017, has been reduced by $1,129,417 from its 
previously reported net position. Amounts for 2017 have not been restated because to do so would be 
impractical, and therefore is not required under the new standard. 
 

Note 2. Deposits and Investments 
 
Deposits: Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the University’s deposits may 
not be returned to it. The University’s deposit policy for custodial credit risk is described as follows: 
 
Oklahoma Statutes require the State Treasurer to ensure that all State funds either be insured by Federal 
Deposit Insurance, collateralized by securities held by the cognizant Federal Reserve Bank or invested in 
U.S. government obligations. The University’s deposits with the State Treasurer are pooled with the funds 
of other State Agencies and then, in accordance with statutory limitations, placed in financial institutions or 
invested as the State Treasurer may determine, in the State’s name. 
 
The University requires that balances on deposit with financial institutions, including trustees related to the 
University’s bond indenture and capital lease agreements, be insured by Federal Deposit Insurance or 
collateralized by securities held by the cognizant Federal Reserve Bank or invested in U.S. Government 
obligations, in the University’s name.

Note 2. Deposits and Investments (Continued) 
 
The University’s carrying amount of the deposits with the State Treasurer and other financial institutions 
was as follows at June 30: 

 
2018 2017

Deposits with the State Treasurer 3,674,679$       5,191,589$       
U.S. financial institutions 7,213                14,820              
Change funds 20,000              20,000              

TOTAL DEPOSITS 3,701,892$       5,226,409$       
 

 
The differences between the bank balances of deposits and the related carrying amounts were generally 
not significant and are due to outstanding checks and deposits in-transit. 
 
Of the $3,674,679 and $5,191,589 in cash and cash equivalents on deposit with the State Treasurer as of 
June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively, $3,502,963 and $5,056,847, respectively, represent 
amounts held within OK INVEST, an internal investment pool.   Agencies and funds that are considered to 
be part of the State’s reporting entity in the State’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report are allowed to 
participate in OK INVEST.  Oklahoma statutes and the State Treasurer establish the primary objectives and 
guidelines governing the investment of funds in OK INVEST.  Safety, liquidity, and return on investment are 
the objectives that establish the framework for the day to day OK INVEST management with an emphasis 
on safety of the capital and the probable income to be derived and meeting the State’s daily cash flow 
requirements.  Guidelines in the State Treasurer’s Investment Policy address credit quality requirements, 
diversification percentages and the types and maturities of allowable investments. The specifics regarding 
these policies can be found on the State Treasurer’s website at http://www.ok.gov/treasurer/.  After 
evaluation of the use and purpose of the University’s participation in the internal investment pool, the 
amount on deposit with OK INVEST is treated as demand accounts and reported as cash equivalents.   
 
At June 30, 2018, and 2017, the University also held nonnegotiable certificates of deposit totaling $83,548 
and $55,688, respectively. These deposits are either fully insured by Federal Deposit Insurance or 
collateralized by securities held by the cognizant Federal Reserve Bank. These certificates of deposit are 
maintained through an investment brokerage firm. For financial reporting purposes, these deposits have 
been classified as investments. 
 
Fair Value Measurement: GASB establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the 
highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to 
unobservable inputs.  The fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

• Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 

• Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in 
active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly, for 
substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

• Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are used when observable inputs are unavailable 
and reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that the market participants would use 
in pricing the assets or liabilities.  Real estate held as investments would be valued as level 3 inputs.

Interest rate risk: The University does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a means 
of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. 
 
Concentration of credit risk: All United States government obligations are held by the Federal Reserve 
Bank in the name of the University. The majority of the University’s certificates of deposits were invested 
through the State Treasurer. 
 
The Board has authorized short-term funds to be invested in any security currently available through the 
State Treasurer’s office. Generally, these include direct obligations of the United States government and 
its agencies, certificates of deposit and demand deposits. 

 
Note 3. Accounts Receivable 
 
Accounts receivable relate to tuition and fee charges to students and to auxiliary services provided to 
students, faculty and staff. Accounts receivable consisted of the following at June 30: 

 
2018 2017

Student tuition and fees 1,699,954$       1,853,276$

Accounts receivable, net 329,480$          334,220$          

 
 
Note 4. Loans Receivable 
 
The University makes loans to students through the Federal Perkins Loan Program (the Program). Under 
the Program, the federal government provides funds for approximately 75% of the total contribution for 
student loans with the University providing the balance. Under certain conditions such loans can be forgiven 
at annual rates of 10% to 30% of the original balance up to maximums of 50% to 100% of the original loan. 
The federal government reimburses the University to the extent of 10% of the amounts forgiven for loans 
originated prior to July 1, 1993, under the program. No reimbursements are provided for loans originated 
after this date. Amounts refundable to the U.S. government upon cessation of the Program of $27,664 at 
June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are reflected in the accompanying statements of net position as 
noncurrent liabilities.

Note 4. Loans Receivable (Continued) 
 
As the University determines that loans are uncollectible and not eligible for reimbursement by the federal 
government, the loans are written off and assigned to the Department of Education. The allowance for 
uncollectible loans only applies to University-funded loans and the University portion of federal student 
loans, as the University is not obligated to fund the federal portion of uncollected student loans.  
 
The University also makes loans to students through the I.L. Ennis Loan Fund, a private loan program. The 
University provides administrative services to the I.L. Ennis Loan Fund (the Loan Fund) in exchange for 
financial assistance for the students. 
 
The University has provided an allowance for uncollectible loans which, in management’s opinion, is 
sufficient to absorb loans which will ultimately be written off.  Loans receivable consisted of the following at 
June 30:  

 

Program Loan Fund Total

Oklahoma Capital Improvement Authority lease obligations:  In 2005, the OCIA issued its State 
Facilities Revenue Bonds (Higher Education Project) Series 2005F. Of the total bond indebtedness, the 
State Regents allocated approximately $6,998,000 to the University. Total lease payments over the term 
of the agreement including principal and interest, beginning July 1, 2006, through July 1, 2030, will be 
$12,223,801. 
 
Payments will be made annually, ranging from $82,033 to $528,546, by the State of Oklahoma on behalf 
of the University. Concurrent with the allocation, the University entered into a lease agreement with OCIA 
for the projects being funded by the OCIA bonds. The proceeds of the bonds and subsequent leases are 
provided for capital improvements at the University. 
 
Through June 30, 2014, the University had drawn its total allotment for expenditures incurred in connection 
with the project. These expenditures have been capitalized as investments in capital assets or recorded as 
operating expenses, in accordance with the University’s policy. The University has recorded a lease 
obligation payable to OCIA for the total amount of the allotment, less repayments made. 
 
During fiscal year 2011, the University’s 2005 lease agreement with OCIA was restructured through a partial 
refunding of the Series 2005F bonds. OCIA issued two new bonds, Series 2010A and 2010B, to accomplish 
the refunding. The restructured lease agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any 
future indebtedness that might be issued to refund earlier bond issues. OCIA issued the new Series 2010A 
and 2010B bonds to provide budgetary relief for fiscal years 2011 and 2012 by extending and restructuring 
the debt service requirements. Consequently, the University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA 
was automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring extended certain 
principal payments into the future, resulting in a cost on the restructuring. The University recorded a charge 
of $623,401 on restructuring as a deferred outflow of resources.  As of June 30, 2016 the cost was 
completely amortized. This restructuring resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and interest between 
the original lease agreement and the restructured lease agreement of $30,810, which approximates the 
economic cost of the transaction. Obligations relating to the 2010B were extinguished in fiscal year 2015.

During fiscal year 2014, the University’s remaining 2005 lease agreement with OCIA was restructured 
through a partial refunding of the Series 2005F bonds. OCIA issued new bonds, Series 2014A, to 
accomplish the refunding. The restructured lease agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond 
indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might be issued to refund earlier bond issues. The 
University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA was automatically restructured to secure the new 
bond issues. The lease restructuring resulted in a reduction of principal, thus the University has recorded a 
credit of $212,623 on restructuring as a deferred inflow of resources that will be amortized over a period of 
eighteen years. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017 the unamortized gain totaled $157,298 and $170,315 
respectively. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal and interest between the
original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of $496,344, which approximates the economic
savings of the transaction. 

Lease principal and interest payments to OCIA related to series 2010A and 2014A, totaling $898,127 and 
$1,176,692 during the years ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively, were made by the State of 
Oklahoma on behalf of the University. These payments have been recorded as on-behalf payments for 
OCIA capital leases in the statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. 

During fiscal year 2015, the University’s remaining 2004 lease agreement with OCIA was restructured 
through a refunding. OCIA issued new bonds, Series 2014B, to accomplish the refunding. The restructured 
lease agreement with OCIA secures the OCIA bond indebtedness and any future indebtedness that might 
be issued to refund earlier bond issues. The University’s aforementioned lease agreement with OCIA was 
automatically restructured to secure the new bond issues. The lease restructuring resulted in a reduction 
of principal, thus the University has recorded a credit of $8,877 on restructuring as a deferred inflow of 
resources that will be amortized over a period of five years. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017 the unamortized 
gain totaled $1,834 and $3,672, respectively. This refinancing resulted in an aggregate difference in principal
and interest between the original lease agreement and the refinanced lease agreement of $14,560, which
approximates the economic savings of the transaction.  

Lease principal and interest payments to OCIA related to series 2014B, totaling $20,082 and $20,013 during 
the years ended June 30, 2018, and 2017, respectively, were made by the State of Oklahoma on behalf of 
the University. These payments have been recorded as on-behalf payments for OCIA capital leases in the 
statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position. 

Oklahoma Development Finance Authority lease obligations: On August 1, 2009, the University 
entered into capital lease obligation Series 2009B in the amount of $2,079,000. Lease payments over the 
term of the agreement, including interest, total $2,963,397. Payments began October 15, 2009, and go 
through May 15, 2029, and will range from $112,206 to $158,223 annually. Proceeds from the obligation 
were used for capital expenditures. The University has pledged the state appropriations received, which 
are restricted for capital purposes, to support payments on this lease obligation.   

On July 14, 2011, the University entered into capital lease obligation Series 2011 in the amount of $909,000. 
Lease payments over the term of the agreement, including interest, total $1,684,113. Payments began 
December 1, 2011, and go through June 1, 2041, and will range from $51,607 to $58,545 annually. 
Proceeds from the obligation were used for capital expenditures. The University has pledged the state 
appropriations received, which are restricted for capital purposes, to support payments on this lease 
obligation.

On June 14, 2014, the University entered into capital lease obligation Series 2014A in the amount of 
$2,693,000 to refinance the 2002 Revenue Bonds and Series 2004A ODFA Capital Lease. Lease payments 
over the term of the agreement, including interest, total $1,792,941 and $1,385,449, for the 2002A and 
2004A, respectively. Payments begin July 15, 2014, and go through May 15, 2022 and 2024 for the 2002A

Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System 
 
Plan description: The University as the employer, participates in the Oklahoma Teachers Retirement Plan—
a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the Oklahoma Teachers 
Retirement System (OTRS). Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 defines all retirement benefits. The authority to 
establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State Legislature. OTRS issues a publicly available 
financial report that can be obtained at www.ok.gov/TRS 
 
Benefits provided: OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to members of the plan.  
Benefit provisions include: 
  

• Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years of credited 
Oklahoma service. Members who joined the System on June 30, 1992 or prior are eligible to retire 
at maximum benefits when age and years of creditable service total 80. Members joining the 
System after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum benefits when their age and years of 
creditable service total 90. Members whose age and service do not equal the eligible limit may 
receive reduced benefits as early as age 55, and at age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on 
their years of service. The maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2% of final compensation for 
each year of credited service. 

 
• Final compensation for members who joined the System prior to July 1, 1992 is defined as the 

average salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final compensation for members 
joining the System after June 30, 1992 is defined as the average of the highest five consecutive 
years of annual compensation in which contributions have been made. The final average 
compensation is limited for service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, 
depending on the member’s election. Monthly benefits are 1/12 of this amount. Service credits 
accumulated after June 30, 1995 are calculated based on each member’s final average 
compensation, except for certain employees of the State’s two comprehensive universities. Upon 
the death of a member who has not yet retired, the designated beneficiary shall receive the 
member’s total contributions plus 100% of interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with 
interest rates varying based on time of service. A surviving spouse of a qualified member may elect

to receive, in lieu of the aforementioned benefits, the retirement benefit the member was entitled to 
at the time of death as provided under the Joint Survivor Benefit Option. 

 
• Upon the death of a retired member, the System will pay $5,000 to the designated beneficiary, in 

addition to the benefits provided for the retirement option selected by the member.  
 

• A member is eligible for disability benefits after ten years of credited Oklahoma service. The 
disability benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable years of credited 
service. 
 

• Upon separation from the System, members’ contributions are refundable with interest based on 
certain restrictions provided in the plan, or by the IRC.  
 

• Members may elect to make additional contributions to a tax-sheltered annuity program up to the 
exclusion allowance provided under the IRC under Code Section 403(b).  

 
Contributions: The contributions requirements of the Plan are at an established rate determined by 
Oklahoma Statute, amended by the Oklahoma Legislature, and are not based on actuarial calculations.  
Employees are required to contribute 7% percent of their annual pay.  Participating employers are required 
to contribute 8.55% of the employees’ annual pay and an additional 7.80% for any employees’ salaries 
covered by federal funds. Contributions to the pension plan from the University were $637,971 and 
$650,374 for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The State of Oklahoma also made on-behalf 
contributions to OTRS, totaling $442,371 and $433,582 during 2018 and 2017, respectively, which were 
recognized by the University; these on-behalf payments did not meet the criteria of a special funding 
situation. 
 
Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to Pensions: - At June 30, 2018 and 2017, the University reported a liability of 
$10,501,352 and $12,482,485, respectively for its proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net 
pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016, and the total pension liability used 
to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017 and June 
30, 2016. The University’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the University’s contributions 
received by the pension plan relative to the total contributions received by the pension plan for all 
participating employers as of June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016.  Based upon this information, the 
University’s proportion was 0.1586 percent and 0.14957 percent for June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 
 
For the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, the University recognized pension expense of $1,101,025 
and $1,168,835, respectively.

Discount Rate: A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability as of June 30, 
2017 and June 30, 2016. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on pension 
plan investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the pension 
plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected 
future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension 
plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension 
liability. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member 
and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of 
payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the matching 
contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five years of actual 
contributions.

As of June 30, 2018 there are no longer any employees or retirees eligible for the supplemental retirement 
plan and therefore there is no financial information to be presented for 2018.  However, 2017 information 
is still presented due to the fact that the University presents comparative financial statements. 
 
Plan description: The Supplemental Retirement Plan (the Plan) is a single-employer defined benefit pension 
plan administered by the University. It guarantees eligible employees a level of retirement benefits. If Social 
Security and OTRS payments do not equal one-half of the employees highest three years’ earnings, the 
University pays the balance from the current year’s operating budget. The authority to establish and amend 
benefit provisions rests with the Board of Regents. The Plan does not issue a separate financial report, nor 
is it included in the financial report of another entity. 
 
Funding policy: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the University made benefit payments of 
$30,870. 

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to Pensions: The University reported a liability of $0 and $161,019 for its net pension

Benefits provided: OTRS pays a medical insurance supplement to eligible members who elect to continue 
their employer provided health insurance. The supplement payment is between $100 and $105 per month, 
remitted to Oklahoma State University Human Resources, provided the member has ten (10) years of 
Oklahoma service prior to retirement. 
 
Contributions: Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 
contained in Title 70, as amended. However the statutes do not specify or identify any particular contribution 
source to pay the health insurance subsidy. Based on the contribution requirements of Title 70 employers 
and employees contribute a single amount based on a single contribution rate as described in Note 7; from 
this amount OTRS allocates a portion of the contributions to the supplemental health insurance program.  
The cost of the supplemental health insurance program averages 0.15% of normal cost, as determined by 
an actuarial valuation. Contributions allocated to the OPEB plan from the University were $10,130. 
 
OPEB Liabilities(Assets), OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of 
Resources Related to OPEB: - At June 30, 2018, the University reported an asset of $70,727 for its 
proportionate share of the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and 
the total OPEB asset used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of 
June 30, 2017. The University’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on the University’s 
contributions received by the OPEB plan relative to the total contributions received by the OPEB plan for 
all participating employers as of June 30, 2017.  Based upon this information, the University’s proportion 
was .1586% percent. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the University recognized OPEB (benefit) expense of ($2,819).  At 
June 30, 2018, the University reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources 
related to OPEB from the following sources:

Actuarial Assumptions: The total OPEB liability (asset) as of June 30, 2017, was determined based on an 
actuarial valuation prepared as if June 30, 2017 using the following actuarial assumptions:  
 

• Actuarial Cost Method - Entry Age  
• Inflation - 2.50%  
• Future Ad Hoc Cost-of-living Increases - None 
• Salary Increases - Composed of 3.25% inflation, including 2.50% price inflation, plus a service-

related component ranging from 0.00% to 8% based on years of service.  
• Investment Rate of Return – 7.50%  
• Retirement Age - Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. Adopted 

by the Board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five year experience study for the period 
ending June 30, 2014.  

• Mortality Rates after Retirement – Males: RP-2000 Combined Mortality Table for males with 
White Collar Adjustments.  Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB 
from table’s base year of 2000.  Females: GRS Southwest Region Teacher Mortality Table, 
scaled at 105%.  Generational mortality improvements in accordance with Scale BB from the 
table’s base year of 2012. 

• Mortality Rates for Active Members – RP – 2000 Employer Mortality tables, with male rates 
multiplied by 60% and female rates multiplied by 50%.

Discount Rate: A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total OPRB liability (asset) as of 
June 30, 2017.  This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on OPEB plan 
investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the OPEB plan’s 
fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all projected future 
benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan 
investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability 
(asset). The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member 
and employer contributions will be made at the current statutory levels and remain a level percentage of 
payrolls. The projection of cash flows also assumed that the State’s contribution plus the matching 
contributions will remain a constant percent of projected member payroll based on the past five years of 
actual contributions.

Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
 
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The 
fair value hierarchy is as follows: 

• Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or 
liabilities in active markets. 

• Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in 
active markets and inputs that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly, for 
substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 

• Level 3 inputs consist of unobservable inputs which are used when observable inputs are unavailable 
and reflect an entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that the market participants would use 
in pricing the assets or liabilities.  Real estate held as investments would be valued as level 3 inputs.

Note 11.  Commitments and Contingencies 
 
During the ordinary course of business, the University may be subjected to various lawsuits and civil action 
claims. At June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no pending lawsuits or claims against the University that 
management believes would result in a material loss to the University in the event of an adverse outcome. 
 
Note 12.  Risk Management 
 
The University is exposed to various risks of loss from torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; 
business interruption; employee injuries and illnesses; natural disasters; employee health, life and accident 
benefits; and unemployment. Commercial insurance coverage is purchased for claims arising from such 
matters other than torts, property damage, workers’ compensation and unemployment. Settled claims have 
not exceeded this commercial coverage in any of the three preceding years. 
 
The University, along with other state agencies and political subdivisions, participates in the State of 
Oklahoma Risk Management Program and the State Insurance Fund, public entity risk pools currently 
operating as a common risk management and insurance program for its members. The University pays an 
annual premium to the pools for its torts, property and workers’ compensation insurance coverages. The 
Oklahoma Risk Management Pool’s governing agreement specifies that the pools will be self-sustaining 
through member premiums and will reinsure through commercial carriers for claims in excess of specified

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND 
ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS  

 

Board of Regents 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 
Oklahoma Panhandle State University 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and 
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the financial statements of Oklahoma Panhandle State University (the “University”), 
an organizational unit of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (the 
“Regents”), which is a component unit of the State of Oklahoma, and its discretely presented component unit, that 
comprise the statement of net position as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of revenue, expenses, and 
changes in net position and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, 
which collectively comprise the University’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated 
October 31, 2018. Our report includes paragraphs related to a change in accounting principle and a reference to 
other auditors who audited the financial statements of Panhandle State Foundation (the “Foundation”), the 
University’s discretely presented component unit, as described in our report on the University’s financial 
statements. The financial statements of the Foundation were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing 
Standards and accordingly this report does not include reporting on internal control over financial reporting or 
instances of reportable noncompliance associated with the Foundation.  

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the University’s internal control 
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances 
for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the University’s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements 
will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough 
to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that 
we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 



 
 

Compliance and Other Matters  
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the University’s financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of 
our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of this Report  
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control or on 
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards 
in considering the University’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable 
for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM  
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE; 

AND REPORT ON THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL 
AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

  

Board of Regents 
Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges 
Oklahoma Panhandle State University 
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  

 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program  
We have audited Oklahoma Panhandle State University’s (the “University”), an organizational unit of the Board of 
Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges (the “Regents”), which is a component unit of the 
State of Oklahoma, compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance 
Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the University’s major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018. The University’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s 
results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its 
federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the University’s major federal programs based 
on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards 
and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the 
University’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary 
in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. 
However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the University’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the University complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred 
to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended 
June 30, 2018.  

 



 
 

Report on Internal Control over Compliance  
Management of the University is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of 
compliance, we considered the University’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that 
could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the University’s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance 
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 
or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. 
A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in 
internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than 
a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not 
been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of 
internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. 
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.  

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance 
We have audited the financial statements of the University as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the University’s basic financial statements. 
We issued our report thereon dated October 31, 2018, which contained an unmodified opinion on those financial 
statements. Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards 
is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of 
the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and 
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The 
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting 
and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in 
relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

Finding 2017-001 Special Tests and Provisions - Return of Title IV Funds 
 
Federal Program: CFDA # 84.063, 84.268, 84.007, 84.033, 84.038 – Student Financial Assistance 
Cluster  
 
Criteria: The total number of calendar days in a payment or enrollment period includes all days within the 
period except for institutionally scheduled breaks of at least five consecutive calendar days including days 
in which the student was on an approved leave of absence are excluded from the total number of calendar 
days in a payment period or period of enrollment. (34 CFR Section 668.22(f)). The Federal Student Aid 
Handbook (Handbook) provides an example of how the enrollment period is calculated. The Handbook 
states, “…the break is calculated using the first day after the last day of class scheduled and the last day of 
the scheduled break is the day before the next class held.” (2017 Federal Student Aid Handbook, Volume 
5). 
 
Condition:  We recalculated the scheduled breaks to determine the number of days to exclude for return 
calculation purposes. We calculated Thanksgiving Break to include five days and Spring Break to include 
nine days. The University calculated Thanksgiving Break as three days and Spring Break as five days and 
did not include Saturdays and Sundays as appropriate. 
 
Questioned Costs: None 
 
Cause and Effect:  The University did not use Saturdays and Sundays in their calculations which resulted 
in inaccurate calculations and inaccurate amounts being refunded to the US Department of Education. 
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the University correct its calculation within their automated system and 
implements a procedure to periodically review these calculations.  
 
Current Year Status: This finding has been corrected in the current period.

Criteria: In accordance with 34 CFR section 685.300(b) “In the program participation agreement, the 
school must promise to comply with the Act and applicable regulations and must agree to – (5) On a 
monthly basis, reconcile institutional records with Direct Loan funds received from the Secretary and Direct 
Loan disbursement records submitted to and accepted by the Secretary.” 
 
Institutions must report all loan disbursements and submit required records to the Direct Loan Servicing 
System (DLSS) via the COD within 15 days of disbursement (OMB No. 1845-0021).  Each month, the 
COD provides institutions with a School Account Statement (SAS) data file which consists of a Cash 
Summary, Cash Detail, and (optional at the request of the school) Loan Detail records.  The school is 
required to reconcile these files to the institution’s financial records.   
 
Condition:  During our School Account Statement (SAS) data file reconciliation testwork, we noted that 
the University did not perform the required monthly reconciliation process throughout the year.  
 
Questioned Costs: Unknown 
 
Cause and Effect: During fiscal 2017, the University implemented new software that was understood to 
automatically reconcile the differences between the SAS data files and the University’s financial records.  
The new software did not reconcile the SAS data file to the University’s records as intended and 
management then failed to perform these reconciliations on a monthly basis. 
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the University perform/review the required reconciliations between the 
SAS data file and the University’s financial records and follow up on any differences noted.   
 
Current Year Status: This finding has been corrected in the current period.
