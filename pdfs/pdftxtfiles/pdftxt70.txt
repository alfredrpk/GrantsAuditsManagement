INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

The Honorable Board of Education
Woodward District #l-1
Woodward County, Oklahoma

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory
basis of the Woodward School District #l-1, Woodward County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2018, as listed in the table of contents.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with the financíal reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State
Department of Education as described in Note 1, to meet the financial reporling requirements of the State
of Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for
the preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or enor.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Sfandards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error. ln making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the
appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my
audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse opinion on u.S. Generally Accepted Accounting principles
As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the
Oklahoma State Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by Woodward School
District #l-1, Woodward County, Oklahoma on the basis of the financial reporting regulations prescribed
or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

lndependent Auditor's Report
Woodward School District #l-1
rège ¿

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting
described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material.

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
ln my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles paragraph, the financial statements referred to in the first
paragraph, do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America, the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended.

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is
a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State
Department of Education noted above. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset
account group is not known.

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting
ln my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on
Regulatory Basis of Accounting" the combined financial statements referred to in the first paragraph
preseni fairly, in ali maieriai respects, the assets, iiabilities and fund balances arising from regulatory
basis transactions of each fund type and account group of the Woodward School District #l-1, Woodward
County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and
encumbered for the year then ended, on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Matters

Other lnformation

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial
statements-regulatory basis within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-
regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under other supplementary
information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined
financial statements-regulatory basis of the District. Also, the accompanying schedule of expenditures of
federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the financial statements.

The combining statements- regulatory basis, and other supplementary information, including the schedule
of expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate
directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial statements-
regulatory basis. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of
the fund type and account group financial statements within the combined financial statements-regulatory
basis and certain addítional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to
the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial
statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. ln my opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis, and
the other supplementary information, including the schedule of expenditures, of federal awards, are fairly
stated in all material respects in relation to the combined financial statements-regulatory basis taken as a
whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
ln accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated March '1 1 , 20'19,
on my consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements and other matters.
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance
with Government Auditing Sfandards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting
and compliance.

Sincerely,

March 11, 2019

WOODWARD SCHOOL DISTRICT #I-1
WOODWARD COUNTY - OKLAHOMA
JULY 1 ,2017 TO JUNE 30, 20,IB

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accountinq Policies

The financial statements of the Woodward School District #l-1 have been prepared in conformity with
another comprehensive basis of accounting required by Oklahoma Statutes. The more significant of the
District's accounting policies are described below.

A. Reportinq Entitv

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the
public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education
and is financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public
schoolsystem is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

'in evaluatirrg irow to cjefine the Disirict, for financiai reporiing purposes, management has considerecj aii
potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was
made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).
The basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity
is the goveming body's oversight responsibility, especially financial interdependency. A second criterion
used in evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. A third criterion used to
evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of
special financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight
responsibilíties. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units
included in the District's reporting entity.

B. Fund Accountinq

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its
operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial
management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities.

A fund is a separate accounting entity wlth a self-balancing set of accounts. An account group, on the
other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets and
liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable available
financial resources.

Funds are classified into two categories; governmental and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided
into separate "fund types"

school construction and debt service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes
federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs which includes the Child
Nutrition Program.

Special Revenue Funds - The Special Revenue Funds are the District's Building Fund, Co-op Fund and
Child Nutrition Fund. The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the
purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment. The
Child Nutrition Fund derives monies from the sale of foods and federal and state program
reimbursements. Expenditures include costs associated with the daily operations of the District's nutrition
program. The Co-op Fund consists of monies generated by two or more school districts (may include
other entities) that have entered into a cooperative agreement to maintain joint programs. The monies
may consist of federal, state and local sources, including the individual contributions of participating
school districts.

Debt Se ice Fund - The Debt Service Fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account for the
accumulation of financlal resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal, interest and
related costs, The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service
and interest earnings from temporary investments.

Caoital P roiect Funds - The Capital Project Funds are the District's Bond Funds and are used to account
for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing, and
equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment.

Fiduciarv Fund Tvpes - Fiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties,
including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held
under the terms of a formal trust agreement, either a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust
fund is used. The terms "nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to whether or not the District is under
an obligation to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that
the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of
operations.

Aqencv Fund - The Agency Funds are the school Activity Fund. The Activity Fund is used to account for
monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups.
The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing, and
accounting for these activity funds. The school Activity Funds can include money which is received from
the sale of foods through a school Lunch Fund.

Memorandum On lv - Total Column - The total column on the general purpose financial statements is
captioned "memorandum only" to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in
this column does not present financial position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund
eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data.

C. Basis of Accountinq and Presentation

The District prepares its fínancial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahorna
State Department of Education (OSDE). This format is essentially the generally accepted form of
presentation used by State and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement
No. 34, Statem e D¡ and Anal is-for State and
Governments This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows:

* Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other
commitments for the expenditure of monies and are recorded as
ex-penditures when approved.* lnvestments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased- Capital assets in proprietary funds are recorded when acquired and
depreciated over their useful lives.* Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.* Long-term debt is recorded when incurred.* Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and
liability when the obligation is incurred.

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become available and
measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related
liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned and liabilities are
incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds.

D Budoets and B Accountino

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget A preliminary budget must be
submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1

COMBINED FINAN PAGE 4

lf the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold an election on the first Tuesday
in February to approve the levy if the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes
the legal budget. lf an election is held and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes
the legal budget. lf voters reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved
tax rate.

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue Funds, and
Debt Service Fund that includes revenues and expenditures.

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.
Encumbrance accounting under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are
recorded as expenditures of the applicable fund is utilized in all governmental funds of the District.

The unencumbered balance of current fiscal year appropriations and the unexpended reserve
appropriations of the previous fiscal year are lapsed and become a part of the beginning fund balance for
the succeeding fiscal year.

E. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financiai siaiements in conformity wiih the regulatory basis of accounting requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reportíng period. Accordingly, actual results
could differ from those estimates.

F. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity

Cash. Cash Eoui ts and f nvestments

All monies which are not invested in Certificate of Deposits or United States Treasury Funds are
maintained in NOW Checking Accounts or Savings Accounts.

lnventories

The value of consumable inventories at June 30,2018 is not material to the financial statements.

Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment

Property and equipment purchases are recorded as capital outlays in the accompanying statements of
revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances. The District does not maintain complete financial
records of capital assets purchased which would include depreciation schedules; therefore, a General
Fixed Asset Group of Accounts is not presented.

Compensated Absences

The District has elected not to present a liability for compensated absences.

Operating Leases

The District has elected not to present a liability for operating leases. All operating leases contain a
mutual ratification clause for both parties; therefore, the District does not consider the obligation io be for
a period extending beyond the current fiscal year.

Lonq Term Debt

Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due, or when resources have
been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For other long-term
obligations, only that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial resources is
reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported
in the general long-term debt account group. Long{erm liabilities expected to be financed from
proprietary fund operations are accounted for in those funds.

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by
the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements.

General Lonq-Term Debt

a.) These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. General long-
term debt of the District consists of bonds payable. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable
solely from fund balance and future revenues of the debt service fund.

Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the
adjustment is made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State
Board of Education rules require that revenue ear,marked for these programs be expended onty for the
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the

The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted
for in the general fund.

Propertv Tax Revenue
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which consists of ad valorem taxes on real
and personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the cedification of tax
levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county
treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of
receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of the taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior
to April l.

lf the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second
half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. lf not paid by the
following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two
years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. lf at the end of two years the owner
has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.

lnterfund Transactions
Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures, or expenses. Transactions that
constitute reimbursement to a fund for expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly
applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. Any
legally authorized transfers are treated as operating transfers and are included in the results of the
Government Funds. Transfers between ihe Agency Funds (Activity Funds) and the Governmental Funci
Types (General Fund) are shown as operating transfers into the Governmental Fund Types (General
Fund) only. No transfer is shown out from the Agency Funds as they are custodial in nature (assets
equal liabilities) and do not involve measurement of results of operations.

2 Risk Manaqement

Liabilities Protection Plan
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of
assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial
insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials
liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage
in any of the past three fiscal years.

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a
transfer or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. ln accordance with professional
standards, the School reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense.
The risk pool is the Oklahoma School Assurance group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose
of providing workers' compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. ln that
capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including
obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing,
and legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG,
the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion
of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated
by projecting losses based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in
excess of the Loss Fund so the District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. lf
the District does not use their loss fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest.

The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public School Unemployment Compensation Program. ln
this program, the District is required to make a deposit based on past experience for potential
unemployment claims. The funds for each District are kept separate. The money contributed by each
District does not earn interest and is fully insured lf the District has claims in excess of the amount of
their account, they would be liable for the excess.

other regular employees of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. A
participant's date of membership is the date the first contribution is made to the System.

The System is administered by a board of trustees which acts as a fiduciary for investing the funds and
governing the administration of the System. The District has no responsibility or authority for the
operation and administration of the System nor has it any liability, except for the current contribution
requirements.

A Participant with 5 years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement allowance at the age of
sixty-two or with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five. The normal retirement allowance paid
monthfy for life and then to beneficiaries, if certain options are exercised, equals two percent of the
average of the highest three earning years of contributory service multiplied by the number of years of
credited service.

A participant leaving employment before attaining retirement age, but completing ten years of service,
may elect to vest his accumulated contributions and defer receipt of a retirement annuity until a later date.
When a participant dies in active service and has completed ten years of credited service, the beneficiary
is entitled to a death benefit of $18,000.00, and the surviving spouse may, in lieu of the death benefit,
elect to receive, subject to the surviving spousal options, the parlicipant's retirement benefits accrued at
the time of death.

WOODWARD SCHOOL DISTRICT #I.1
WOODWARD COUNTY - OKLAHOMA
SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS
ALLOCATIONS & EXPENDITURES
07t01t17 TO 06/30/18

NorE 1: The schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards was prepared using the same accounting policies used in preparing the D¡strict,s financial statements. TheDistrict's policy is to recognize expenditures when encumbered (contracted for) rather than at the time the related fund tiabiliÇ is incurred.
NorE 2 The District policy is to expend child Nutrition federal, state and local revenues, in that order, during each f¡scal year. lf there are any unexpended federal orstate funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year, those funds will be expended during the next fiscal year, prior to the unilizatìon of current year funding.
NorE 3: The amount shown as received and expended in the child Nutrition cluster for commodities represents a nonmonetary value of the food commoditiesreceived Therefore' the total revenues and expenditures do not agree with the financial statements by this amount,
NOTE 4: lndirect Cost included in total expenditures

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOYERNMENT AUDITING STA/VD,ARDS

The Honorable Board of Education
Woodward School District #l-1
Woodward County, Oklahoma

I have audited, in accordance with audit¡ng standards generally accepted in the United States of America
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Sfandards, issued by
the Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial
statements-regulatory basis of the Woodward School District #l-1, Woodward County, Oklahoma, as
listed in the Table of Contents , as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the
financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and have issued my
report thereon dated March 11,2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because the
presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not
conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However,
my report was qualified for the omission for general fixed asset account groups with respect to the
presentation of financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma
State Board of Education.

lnternal Control Over Financial Reporting
ln planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control
over financial reporling (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing my opinion on the financial statements, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, I do
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of the District's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a
timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged
with governance.

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses may or significant deficiencies
may exist that were not identified. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control that I consider to be material weaknesses However, material weaknesses
may exist that have not been identified. I did identify certain deficiencies in internal control, described in
the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as item 18-01 that lconsider to be a
significant deficiency.

Compliance and Other Matters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of
material misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on
the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with
those provisions was not an ob¡ectrve of my audit and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The
results of my tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be
reported under Goyernment Auditing Standards.

Woodward School District #l-1
Woodward County, Oklahoma
Page Two

Response to Findings
The District's response to the findings identified in my audit is described in the accompanying school's
corrective action plan. The District's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in
the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, I express no opinion on it.

Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's control or
on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government
Auditing Sfandards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this
communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Sincerely,

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

The Honorable Board of Education
Woodward School District #l-l
Woodward County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal program
I have audited the Woodward School District #l-1, Woodward County, Oklahoma compliance with the
types of compliance requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principats, ad Audit Requirements for Federat Awards (lJniform
Guidance) that could have a direct and material effect on each of Woodward School District #l-1's major
federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified
in the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned
costs.

Management's Responsibility
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts and
grants applicable to íts federal programs.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs
based on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America;the
standai'ds appficable to financial audits coniainecj irt Government Auditing SÍandards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States, and Titte 2 U.S. Code of Federat Regutations Part 200, IJniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, ad Audit Requirements for Federat Awards (Uniform
Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred
to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those requirements and
performing such other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstances.

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance with each major federal
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program
ln my opinion, Woodward School District #l-l complied, in all material respects, with the types of
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 20'lB.

Report on lnternal Control Over Compliance
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
compliance with the types of compliance referred to above. ln planning and performing my audit of
compliance, I considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that
could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion oñ
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in
accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the
effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficíency in
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged
with governance.

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that I consider to be material weaknesses. However,
material weaknesses may exÍst that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my
testing of internaf control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Sincerely,
