INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

To the Honorable J. Kevin Stitt, Governor 
and Members of the Legislature 
of the State of Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited the State of Oklahoma’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements 
described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of 
the State of Oklahoma’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The State of 
Oklahoma’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  We did not audit compliance with those 
requirements that are applicable to the major federal programs administered by the Department of 
Commerce and the Department of Wildlife Conservation, which were audited in accordance with the 
provisions of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Costs Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). 
All of the federal programs for the above referenced agencies represent 0.98% of total expenditures 
for federal programs reported on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards.  These entities 
were audited by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it 
relates to compliance with the compliance requirements for the above-mentioned entities, is based 
solely upon the reports of the other auditors. 

The State of Oklahoma’s basic financial statements include the operations of component units, some 
of which received federal awards.  Those component units are not included in the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards for the year ended June 30, 2018.  Our audit, described below, did not 
include the operations of those component units because they engaged other auditors to perform audits 
in accordance with Uniform Guidance. 

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 



 

 

 
 
 
 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the State of Oklahoma’s major 
federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above and the  
reports of other auditors. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards 
generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; 
and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform 
Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the State of Oklahoma’s compliance with 
those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. 
 
We believe that our audit and the reports of other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our qualified 
and unmodified opinions on compliance for major federal programs. However, our audit does not 
provide a legal determination of the State of Oklahoma’s compliance. 
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion on Medicaid Cluster 

As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, we were unable to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence supporting the compliance of the State of Oklahoma with CFDA 
#93.778 Medicaid Cluster - Special Tests Requirement (N6) as described in finding #2018-054. 
Consequently, we were unable to determine whether the State of Oklahoma complied with this 
requirement applicable to that program.  
 
Qualified Opinion on Medicaid Cluster 

In our opinion, except for the possible effects of the matter described in the immediately preceding 
Basis for Qualified Opinion paragraph, the State of Oklahoma complied, in all material respects, with 
the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on 
the Medicaid Cluster for the year ended June 30, 2018.  
 
Basis for Qualified Opinion on SNAP Cluster; Child Nutrition Cluster; Child and Adult Food Care 
Program; Unemployment Insurance; Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies; Supporting 
Effective Instruction State Grants; Foster Care – Title IV-E; and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance 
 
As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, the State of Oklahoma 
did not comply with requirements regarding the following:

Qualified Opinion on SNAP Cluster; Child Nutrition Cluster; Child and Adult Food Care Program; 
Unemployment Insurance; Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies; Supporting Effective 
Instruction State Grants; Foster Care – Title IV-E; and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance 

In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the immediately preceding Basis for 
Qualified Opinion paragraph, the State of Oklahoma complied, in all material respects, with the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on the SNAP 
Cluster; Child Nutrition Cluster; Child and Adult Food Care Program; Unemployment Insurance; Title 
I Grants to Local Educational Agencies; Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants; Foster Care – 
Title IV-E; and Disaster Grants - Public Assistance programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Unmodified Opinion on Each of the Other Major Federal Programs 
 
In our opinion, based on our audit and the report of other auditors, the State of Oklahoma complied, in 
all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a 
direct and material effect on each of its other major federal programs identified in the summary of 
auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs for the year 
ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Other Matters 
 
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed other instances of noncompliance, which are required 
to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs as items: 

 
2018-001 2018-002 2018-003 2018-009 2018-013 2018-014

The State of Oklahoma’s response to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit is described in 
the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs and corrective action plan. The State of 
Oklahoma’s response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance 
and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response. 

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the State of Oklahoma is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal 
control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and 
performing our audit of compliance, we considered the State of Oklahoma’s internal control over 
compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major 
federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the  
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report 
on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of Oklahoma’s internal control over compliance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the 
preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. However, as discussed below, 
we identified certain deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material 
weaknesses and significant deficiencies. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such  
that there is reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement 
of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. We consider 
the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings 
and questioned costs as items (see list below) to be material weaknesses. 

2018-003 2018-010 2018-011 2018-012 2018-013 2018-015 
2018-016 2018-019 2018-022 2018-033 2018-034 2018-047 
2018-052 2018-054 2018-057 2018-061 2018-067 

A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important  

5



enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the deficiencies in internal 
control over compliance described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as 
items (see list below) to be significant deficiencies. 

2018-001 2018-002 2018-008 2018-009 2018-014 2018-017
2018-020 2018-023 2018-027 2018-028 2018-030 2018-036
2018-037 2018-038 2018-044 2018-048 2018-054 2018-059

2018-075 2018-076 2018-077 2018-078 2018-079 2018-080 

The State of Oklahoma’s response to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our 
audit is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs and corrective action 
plan. The State of Oklahoma’s response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.  

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.  

Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance 

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, 
the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the State of Oklahoma as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related 
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the State of Oklahoma’s basic 
financial statements. We issued our report thereon dated December 22, 2018, which contained 
unmodified opinions on those financial statements.  Our report included a reference to our reliance on 
other auditors. Our report also included emphasis paragraphs on the net deficit of the Multiple Injury 
Trust Fund and the adopted provisions of GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial 
Reporting for  Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions; GASB Statement No. 81, 
Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements; GASB Statement No 85, Omnibus 2017; and GASB 
Statement No. 86, Certain Debt Extinguishment Issues effective July 1, 2017.   

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of  
federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance 
and is not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility 
of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and 
other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements 
themselves, and other 

6



additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. In our opinion, based on our audit, the procedures performed as described previously, and the 
reports of other auditors, the schedule of expenditure of federal awards is fairly stated in all material 
respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGS 

Reference Number: 18-695-006 
State Agency:  Oklahoma Tax Commission (the Commission) 
Fund Type: Governmental Activities 

Criteria: The GASB 33 Recognition Standards section states, in part, “The timing of recognition for each class of 
nonexchange transactions is outlined below. . . . Derived tax revenues – Assets–when the underlying exchange 
transaction occurs or resources are received, whichever is first.” Paragraph 16 states, in part, “Governments should 
recognize assets from derived tax revenue transactions in the period when the exchange transaction on which the tax 
is imposed occurs or when the resources are received, whichever occurs first.” Paragraph 67 states, in part, “for 
derived tax revenues, a government should recognize assets when the exchange transaction on which the 
government imposes the tax occurs. At that point, the government has a legal claim to the provider’s resources, 
supported by the enabling legislation. That is so, even if actual payment to the government in not required until a 
later date or, if the amount of the required payment is not certain (but is reasonably estimable), until a tax return or 
other require validation report is submitted and accepted.”   

The Governmental Accounting, Auditing, and Financial Reporting Chapter 7, Measurement Focus and Basis of 
Accounting states, in part, “Governmental fund financial statements use the current financial resources measurement 
focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. All other financial statements (proprietary fund, fiduciary fund, 
and government-wide) use the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, with the 
exception of agency funds (which technically have no measurement focus but do employ the accrual basis of 
accounting for purposes of asset and liability recognition).” Chapter 8, Categories of Transactions and Events and 
Their Recognition states, in part, “Governments frequently generate revenue from exchange transactions to which 
they are not a party.” It also states, “Accountants describe such arrangements as derived tax revenues, because the 
revenue results (derives) from events unrelated to the government’s own operations. A government should recognize 
both a receivable and revenue (net of estimated refunds and uncollectible amounts) as soon as the underlying 
exchange transaction has taken place.” Chapter 9, Revenue Recognition in Governmental Funds states, in part, 
“Derived tax revenues arise when a government imposes a tax on an exchange transaction to which it is not a party. 
The most commonly encountered examples are sales taxes and income taxes.” It also states, “A government should 
recognize a receivable, net of estimated refunds and uncollectible amounts, as soon as the underlying exchange 
transaction has taken place.”      

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 10.03 
states, in part, “Transactions are promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in 
controlling operations and making decisions. This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or event 
from its initiation and authorization through its final classification in summary records. In addition, management 
designs control activities so that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded.” 

Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) GAAP Conversion Manual for GAAP Package E. Taxes 
Receivable and Refunds Payable Conversion Package IV. A. 3. states, “Taxes receivables as of June 30 can be 
estimated by compiling the tax receipts in July and August. Specify by the type of tax. If your agency has a 
receivable system in place that system should be used.” 

Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) GAAP Conversion Manual for GAAP Package C. Accounts 
Receivable/Deferred Revenue Conversion Package IV. A. states, “Calculate or estimate the amount of cash that has 
been collected or reported, or will be collected or reported, for each type of revenue for any year(s) subsequent to 
this fiscal year to determine the amount of deferred revenue.”  Section III. E. states, in part, “Accounts receivable 
are all amounts that are measurable and due to your agency from parties outside state government at June 30.  As of 
June 30, you either: 

* Have billed these non-state parties and not yet collected the related cash, or
* Know that these parties owe you money even though you have not yet billed them.”

Condition and Context: We noted the amount reported by the Commission as Taxes Receivable on the GAAP 
Package E-1 was derived from taxes due to the Commission as of June 30, 2018 and received between July 1, 2018 

11

to August 30, 2018. Since the Commission reported tax payments received between July 1 and August 30, 2018, the 
remaining taxes due to the Commission as of June 30, 2018 were not accounted for on the GAAP Package E-1. 
Based on the definition of accrual accounting, the taxes earned and expected to be collected by the Commission as 
of June 30, 2018 should have been included in the taxes receivable balance reported for SFY 2018.  

We noted the amount reported by the Commission as Accounts Receivable on the GAAP Package C-1 was derived 
from interest and penalties due to the Commission as of June 30, 2018 and received between July 1, 2018 to August 
30, 2018. Since the Commission reported interest and penalty payments received between July 1 and August 30, 
2018, the remaining interest and penalties due to the Commission as of June 30, 2018 were not accounted for on the 
GAAP Package C-1. Based the of definition of accrual accounting, the interest and penalties earned and expected to 
be collected by the Commission as of June 30, 2018 should have been included in the accounts receivable balance 
reported for SFY 2018. 

Cause: The method currently being used by the Commission to calculate Taxes Receivable and 
Accounts Receivable does not comply with GAAP accrual basis accounting. The method used does not 
consider all taxes, interest, and penalties due to the Commission at year-end but rather only accounts for the 
taxes, interest, and penalties collected for July and August related to June 30, 2018.    

Effect: The Taxes Receivable amount reported by the Commission on the GAAP Package E-1 and the 
Accounts Receivable amount reported by the Commission on the GAAP Package C-1 excluded some of the taxes, 
interest, and penalties due to the Commission at year-end.  

Recommendation: We recommend the Commission develop a method to determine and report Taxes Receivables 
and Accounts Receivable in compliance with the accrual basis of accounting.  This method should include taxes, 
interest, and penalties earned as of year-end.

State Agency:  Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
Fund Type: Governmental Activities & General Fund 

Criteria: Statewide Accounting Manual paragraph 12.13 Supervising Internal Control Activities states, 
“…Supervisors should systematically review each staff member’s work.” 

A component objective of an effective internal control system is to ensure accurate and reliable information through 
a proper review and approval process. 

Paragraph 13.02 of GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states, “Management designs a 
process that uses the entity’s objectives and related risks to identify the information requirements needed to achieve 
the objectives and address the risks.” 

Paragraph 13.04 of GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states, “… Reliable internal and 
external sources provide data that are reasonably free from error and bias and faithfully represent what they purport 
to represent. Management evaluates both internal and external sources of data for reliability.” 

A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information. 

Condition: During our review of the preliminary financial statements and statewide adjusting journal entries, we 
noted 4 material errors that required adjustment to the preliminary financial statements. The errors noted were, as

follows: 

 An overstatement of the Net Pension Liability by approximately $1.7 billion. 
 A misclassification of expenditures resulting in an overstatement of $568.8 million in Social Services 

expenditures and an understatement of $568.8 million in Education expenditures. 
 The recording of an entry from FY 2017 again instead of the entry for FY 2018 resulting in an 

understatement of Capital Outlay by approximately $33.5 million. 
 An understatement of the Government-Wide Net Position of approximately $191.1 million relating to an 

incorrect recording of Deferred Inflows and Deferred Outflows of Resources Relating to Pensions. 
 
After the errors were discussed with the Financial Reporting Unit at OMES, all necessary corrections were made. 
 
Cause: The current review process in place at OMES did not detect the errors in the adjusting journal entries prior 
to recording them.  
 
Effect: Material misstatements were present in the preliminary financial statements that were provided to the 
Auditor’s Office. 
 
Recommendation: The agency should review their internal control procedures and implement additional controls to 
strengthen the review process of the adjusting journal entries and preliminary financial statements to ensure they are 
adequately reviewed prior to submitting to the Auditor’s Office. In addition, we recommend that the agency perform 
a comparison of preliminary financial statements and adjusting journal entries (government-wide and fund) to the 
prior year to identify any unexpected change in balances.

QUESTIONED COSTS: $0 
 
Criteria: 34 CFR § 200.19(b)(1) Other academic indicators - High Schools – Graduation Rate states in part: 
 
 “Consistent with paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section regarding reporting and determining AYP, 
respectively, each State must calculate a graduation rate, defined as follows, for all public high schools in the State:  

13



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 

(i) (A) A State must calculate a “four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate,” defined as the number of students 
who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form 
the adjusted cohort for that graduating class. 
(B) For those high schools that start after grade nine, the cohort must be calculated based on the earliest 
high school grade.  
 

(ii) The term “adjusted cohort” means the students who enter grade 9 (or the earliest high school grade) and 
any students who transfer into the cohort in grades 9 through 12 minus any students removed from the cohort.  
 

(A) The term “students who transfer into the cohort” means the students who enroll after the beginning of 
the entering cohort's first year in high school, up to and including in grade 12.  
(B) To remove a student from the cohort, a school or LEA must confirm in writing that the student 
transferred out, emigrated to another country, or is deceased.  

(1) To confirm that a student transferred out, the school or LEA must have official written 
documentation that the student enrolled in another school or in an educational program that culminates 
in the award of a regular high school diploma.  
(2) A student who is retained in grade, enrolls in a General Educational Development (GED) program, 
or leaves school for any other reason may not be counted as having transferred out for the purpose of 
calculating graduation rate and must remain in the adjusted cohort.  

 
(iii) The term “students who graduate in four years” means students who earn a regular high school diploma at 
the conclusion of their fourth year, before the conclusion of their fourth year, or during a summer session 
immediately following their fourth year.  
 
(iv) The term “regular high school diploma” means the standard high school diploma that is awarded to 
students in the State and that is fully aligned with the State's academic content standards or a higher diploma 
and does not include a GED credential, certificate of attendance, or any alternative award. 
 
(v) In addition to calculating a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, a State may propose to the Secretary 
for approval an “extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.”  

 
(A) An extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate is defined as the number of students who graduate in 
four years or more with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the 
adjusted cohort for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, provided that the adjustments account for 
any students who transfer into the cohort by the end of the year of graduation being considered minus the 
number of students who transfer out, emigrate to another country, or are deceased by the end of that year.  
(B) A State may calculate one or more extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rates.” 

 
2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.”  
 
Condition and Context:  OSDE does not have appropriate policies and procedures in place to ensure that all LEAs 
maintain appropriate documentation to confirm when students have been removed from the regulatory adjusted 
cohort. In addition, OSDE does not verify that the LEA maintains appropriate written documentation to support the 
removal of a student from the regulatory adjusted cohort. 
 
Cause: OSDE was unable to fully implement procedures in 2018 to ensure LEA’s maintain documentation to 
identify all students who have been removed from the regulatory adjusted cohort. 
 
Effect: Failure to review and verify changes to the State’s regulatory adjusted cohort could result in faulty 
graduation rate data being reported.

Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop policies and procedures to ensure that LEAs maintain 
appropriate documentation to confirm when students have been removed from the regulatory adjusted cohort. In 
addition, we recommend that OSDE develop procedures to adequately verify that LEAs maintain appropriate written 
documentation to support the removal of a student from the regulatory adjusted cohort.

Criteria: 2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The non-Federal entity must establish and 
maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal 
entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award.”  
 
20 U.S. Code § 6339 Carryover and waiver (a) - Limitation on carryover states,  “Notwithstanding section 1225(b) 
of this title or any other provision of law, not more than 15 percent of the funds allocated to a local educational 
agency for any fiscal year under this subpart (but not including funds received through any reallocation under this 
subpart) may remain available for obligation by such agency for one additional fiscal year.” 
 
20 U.S. Code § 6339 Carryover and waiver (c) - Exclusion states, “The percentage limitation under subsection (a) of 
this section shall not apply to any local educational agency that receives less than $50,000 under this subpart for any 
fiscal year.” 
 
Condition and Context:  While performing compliance testwork on 25 of 195 LEAs identified by OSDE as having 
potential carryover amounts (more than 15 percent of the funds allocated for a given year), we noted that four LEAs 
were not in compliance with the excess carryover requirements.  No waiver was granted for any of the four LEA’s 
which would have allowed them to keep the carryover funds.  In addition, OSDE failed to release (reduce) FY16 
Title I Part A funds for all 4 LEAs and inappropriately included the amounts, which totaled $89,151.03, in the 
LEA’s FY17 Title I Part A allocations.   
 
In addition, OSDE did not maintain supporting documentation used for their initial Excess Carryover Worksheet 
calculations which would have enabled SAI to adequately verify whether all LEAs were included in the calculations 
appropriately. 
 
Cause: It appears that OSDE does not have an adequate tracking and review process to 1) ensure that all LEAs 
subject to carryover requirements are included in the calculation of excess carryover; 2) to ensure that amounts used 
in the calculation of excess carryover are correct and, 3) to ensure that excess carryover funds that don’t meet period 
of performance are released (reduced) appropriately.     
 
Effect: Failure to 1) appropriately identify LEAs subject to excess carryover requirements; 2) ensure excess 
carryover amounts are calculated correctly and; 3) to release excess carryover funds timely could result in 
inappropriate use of Federal funds.

And Questioned Costs 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop and implement an adequate tracking process which is 
reviewed by someone other than the preparer to ensure that all LEAs subject to carryover requirements are included 
in the calculation of excess carryover and to ensure that amounts used in the calculation of excess carryover are 
correct. In addition, we recommended that OSDE develop procedures to ensure the release of excess carryover funds 
is performed appropriately and timely.

CONTROL CATEGORY:  Level of Effort - Supplement not Supplant 
QUESTIONED COSTS: $0 
 
Criteria:  20 U.S. Code § 6321 - Fiscal requirements states in part:  

 “(b) Federal funds to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds - 

      (1) IN GENERAL - A State educational agency or local educational agency shall use Federal funds 
received under this part only to supplement the funds that would, in the absence of such Federal funds, be 
made available from non-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in programs assisted 
under this part, and not to supplant such funds.”   

 
20 U.S. Code § 6314 (a) (2) - Schoolwide programs states in part: 

“(B) SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS- In accordance with the method of determination described in section 
6321(b)(2) of this title, a school participating in a schoolwide program shall use funds available to carry out 
this section only to supplement the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds under this part, be 
made available from non-Federal sources for the school, including funds needed to provide services that are 
required by law for children with disabilities and English learners” 

 
20 U.S. Code § 6623 – Local uses of funds states in part:  

“(b)SUPPLEMENT, NOT SUPPLANT- Funds received under this subpart shall be used to supplement, and 
not supplant, non-Federal funds that would otherwise be used for activities authorized under this subpart.”  

 
2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  OSDE was not able to quantifiably demonstrate that Federal expenditures are in 
compliance with Level of Effort – Supplement not Supplant requirements. A review of budgeted items on the 
Consolidated Application is performed; however, it is a non-documented, cursory review of budgeted items and no 
system based calculations or manual calculations are used to determine if the budgeted items are in compliance with 
Level of Effort – Supplement not Supplant requirements. Also, the current supplement not supplant procedures are 
performed only on budgeted items and not on the actual expenditures.     
 
In addition, OSDE did not perform the following Level of Effort – Supplement not Supplant determinations:

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 

Non-schoolwide programs- 
a. If the LEA used Federal funds to provide services which they were required to make available under 

Federal, State, or local law and were also made available by funds subject to a supplement not supplant 
requirement.  

b. If the LEA used Federal funds to provide services which were provided with non-Federal funds in the 
prior year:  
1) Identify the federally funded services.  
2) Perform procedures to determine whether the Federal program funded services that were 

previously provided with non-Federal funds.  
3) Perform procedures to ascertain if the total level of services applicable to the requirement 

increased in proportion to the level of Federal contribution. 
 

Schoolwide programs (Title I, Part A only) – For Federal funds consolidated with State and local funds, the 
LEA provided the school all of the non-Federal funds it would otherwise have received from the LEA if it 
were not operating a schoolwide program. 

 
Cause: OSDE has not developed and implemented appropriate procedures to quantifiably demonstrate that Federal 
expenditures are in compliance with the Level of Effort – Supplement not Supplant requirements.   
 
Effect: OSDE is unable to accurately identify if Federal funds are being used inappropriately to supplant funds 
from non-Federal sources.   
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop adequate policies and procedures to quantifiably 
demonstrate that federal expenditures are in compliance with Level of Effort – Supplement not Supplant 
requirements.

QUESTIONED COSTS: $0 
 
Criteria: 34 CFR § 76.787 What definitions apply to this subpart? - states in part, “For purposes of this subpart -  
Significant expansion of enrollment means a substantial increase in the number of students attending a charter school 
due to a significant event that is unlikely to occur on a regular basis, such as the addition of one or more grades or 
educational programs in major curriculum areas. The term also includes any other expansion of enrollment that the 
SEA determines to be significant.” 

34 CFR § 76.789 What are an SEA's responsibilities under this subpart? - states in part,   
“(a) Information. Upon receiving notice under § 76.788(a) of the date a charter school LEA is scheduled to 
open or significantly expand its enrollment, an SEA must provide the charter school LEA with timely and 
meaningful information about each covered program in which the charter school LEA may be eligible to 
participate, including notice of any upcoming competitions under the program.

(b)Allocation of Funds.  

(1) An SEA must allocate funds under a covered program in accordance with this subpart to any charter 
school LEA that -  

(i) Opens for the first time or significantly expands its enrollment during an academic year for which 
the State awards funds by formula or through a competition under the program;  

…. 

(3)  (ii) Except as provided in § 76.792(c), an SEA that receives less than 120 days' actual notice of the 
date an eligible charter school LEA is scheduled to open or significantly expand its enrollment must 
allocate funds to the charter school LEA on or before the date the SEA allocates funds to LEAs under 
the applicable covered program for the succeeding academic year.” 

 
34 CFR § 76.791 On what basis does an SEA determine whether a charter school LEA that opens or significantly 
expands its enrollment is eligible to receive funds under a covered program?- states, 

“(a) For purposes of this subpart, an SEA must determine whether a charter school LEA is eligible to 
receive funds under a covered program based on actual enrollment or other eligibility data for the charter 
school LEA on or after the date the charter school LEA opens or significantly expands its enrollment.  
(b) For the year the charter school LEA opens or significantly expands its enrollment, the eligibility 
determination may not be based on enrollment or eligibility data from a prior year, even if the SEA makes 
eligibility determinations for other LEAs under the program based on enrollment or eligibility data from a 
prior year.” 

 
34 CFR § 76.792 How does an SEA allocate funds to eligible charter school LEAs under a covered program in 
which the SEA awards subgrants on a formula basis? – states in part,  

“(a) For each eligible charter school LEA that opens or significantly expands its enrollment on or before 
November 1 of an academic year, the SEA must implement procedures that ensure that the charter school 
LEA receives the proportionate amount of funds for which the charter school LEA is eligible under each 
covered program.” 
 

34 CFR § 76.796 What are the consequences of an SEA allocating more or fewer funds to a charter school LEA 
under a covered program than the amount for which the charter school LEA is eligible when the charter school LEA 
actually opens or significantly expands its enrollment? - states, 

“a) An SEA that allocates more or fewer funds to a charter school LEA than the amount for which the 
charter school LEA is eligible, based on actual enrollment or eligibility data when the charter school LEA 
opens or significantly expands its enrollment, must make appropriate adjustments to the amount of funds 
allocated to the charter school LEA as well as to other LEAs under the applicable program.  
(b) Any adjustments to allocations to charter school LEAs under this subpart must be based on actual 
enrollment or other eligibility data for the charter school LEA on or after the date the charter school LEA 
first opens or significantly expands its enrollment, even if allocations or adjustments to allocations to other 
LEAs in the State are based on enrollment or eligibility data from a prior year.” 

 
34 CFR § 76.797 When is an SEA required to make adjustments to allocations under this subpart? - states in part, 

“(a) The SEA must make any necessary adjustments to allocations under a covered program on or before 
the date the SEA allocates funds to LEAs under the program for the succeeding academic year.”  

 
2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  When documenting controls over newly opening and significantly expanding charter 
schools, we determined that the Federal programs department (Title I-Part A, Supporting Effective Instruction State

Grant) did not implement policies and procedures to define the criteria used to determine if a school has 
significantly expanded (addition of grade level, addition of major curriculum area, etc.) during our audit period.  
 
In addition, when performing testwork for all newly opening and significantly expanding charter schools, OSDE 
was unable to provide details on any of the new or expanding charter school LEA’s/charter school’s eligibility or 
enrollment data for the year in which the school opened or expanded for any of the eleven (11) charter schools 
which notified OSDE accreditation department that they [charter school] were newly opening or expanding by one 
or more grade levels effective for the start of the school year. Lastly, OSDE was unable to provide details on how 
the allocation adjustment for the prior year charter schools that were recognized as new or significantly expanding 
was handled since OSDE did not correct the prior year finding during our audit period. 
 
Cause: It appears that staff turnover within the Federal programs department along with a failure to correctly apply 
all of the compliance requirements resulted in OSDE not incorporating appropriate policies and procedures that 
would ensure that new or significantly expanding charter schools receive the amount of Federal formula funds for 
which they were eligible in a timely manner. 
 
Effect: New or significantly expanding charter schools did not receive the amount of Federal formula funds for 
which they were eligible in a timely manner. 
 
Recommendation: We recommended that OSDE develop policies and procedures to: 

 Define the criteria used to determine if a school has significantly expanded (addition of grade level, 
addition of major curriculum area, etc.). 

 Track the date the OSDE Accreditation department first receives notice that a charter school is newly 
opening or significantly expanding to ensure that allocations are adjusted in a timely manner. 

 Follow-up on any allocations which are required to be adjusted on or before the date the SEA allocates 
funds to LEAs under the applicable covered program for the succeeding academic year. 

 Ensure proper supporting documentation is maintained for any determinations or allocations of new or 
significantly expanding charter schools.

a hold-harmless base for the prior year that reflects the new or significantly expanded enrollment of the charter

2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  When documenting controls over earmarking and newly opening and significantly 
expanding charter schools, we determined that the Federal programs department did not implement procedures to 
ensure that the calculation of the hold-harmless base for the prior year reflects the new or significantly expanded 
enrollment of the charter school LEA’s.   
 
Cause: It appears that staff turnover within the Federal programs department along with a failure to correctly apply 
all of the compliance requirements resulted in OSDE not incorporating appropriate policies and procedures that 
would ensure that the hold-harmless base for new or significantly expanding charter schools was applied correctly.  
 
Effect: The department is not in compliance with ESEA § 4306(c).  In addition, new or significantly expanding 
charter schools have a higher hold-harmless base than they should have. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop policies and procedures to calculate the correct hold-
harmless amount for new or significantly expanding charter schools.

State law and regulations related to academic assessments. The rules will bring the state into compliance with the 
following state and federal statutes and regulations: 
(5)    This monitoring program is intended to: 

(A)    Ensure the testing of all eligible students, proper training of school district staff is conducted, test 
security is maintained, assessments are administered consistently and in a uniform manner as mandated in 
the Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) sections 210:10-13-2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11.” 
 

OAC § 210:10-13-21(e) Academic Assessment Monitoring Program (AAMP) – Monitoring Procedures states in 
part,  
“(2)    Desk monitoring.  

(D)    District Superintendents and District Test Coordinators of the school district to be monitored will 
receive a Desk Monitoring Checklist, ten (10) working days before the opening of the testing window. The 
section of the checklist titled, "District Provided Documentation" must be completed and documents 
returned to the Office of Accountability and Assessments of the Oklahoma State Department of Education 
within twenty (20) working days from the last testing day of the assessment window.” 

 
OAC § 210:10-13-21(f) (1) Failure to comply with state and federal regulations related to Academic Assessment 
states in part, 

“The Office of Accountability and Assessments will provide monitoring results to the district 
superintendent. The monitoring results will inform a district that they have met or not met requirements of 
Subsection (a) of these rules related to student academic testing. Districts will be designated as in 
compliance if all requirements have been met, or if any monitored area is found deficient then the district 
and the school will be designated as noncompliant. If a district is designated as noncompliant, the Office of 
Accountability and Assessment staff will annually conduct monitoring activities until the district is in 
compliant status.”  

Condition and Context:  During our review of controls over the Monitoring Progress Spreadsheet, we determined 
that OSDE did not provide monitoring results to the district superintendent’s in a reasonable timeframe for any of 
the On-Site or Desk Monitoring that was performed in 2018.  The documentation was required to be submitted by 
the school districts by May 25, 2018; however, almost none of the sites were reviewed by November 2018, when we 
received the initial monitoring log.  The majority of the monitoring appears to have been completed in January and 
February of 2019, approximately 8 to 9 months after the school district’s documentation was provided. Lastly, no 
compliance letters had been sent to district superintendent’s as of February 9, 2019. 
 
In addition, the Monitoring Progress Spreadsheet is not designed appropriately to ensure compliance. The 
spreadsheet does not include the date that the desk and on-site monitoring checklists are completed by OSDE, the 
date the desk and on-site monitoring checklists are reviewed, the date the compliance letter is sent to the District, 
and whether the compliance letter was sent to the district superintendent and the monitoring status. Also, the desk 
and on-site monitoring checklists do not include a signature and date for the OSDE employee completing the 
checklist or, the name and date of the employee who reviews the completed checklist. 
 
Lastly, while testing 47 of 307 monitored sites, we noted the following issues: 

 For three sites, the monitoring checklist did not contain DocuSign of Nondisclosure Agreement and District 
Level Security Forms; however, all three sites were marked as compliant.  

 For two sites, the monitoring checklist did not contain the districts policies and procedures. However, both 
sites were still considered compliant;  

 For one site, the district was missing District level Test Security; however, the district was still marked as 
being compliant.  

 
Cause: The Department does not have adequate controls in place to ensure all desk and on-site monitoring are 
completed and properly supported. It also appears that OSDE did not have an adequate tracking mechanism to 
ensure monitoring was completed timely and reviewed appropriately.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
Effect: The failure to send compliance letters to district superintendents within a reasonable timeframe can result in 
schools having insufficient time to implement changes to ensure the school district staff are properly trained before 
the next testing cycle. 
 
In addition, the failure to ensure that 1) an LEA has appropriate policies and procedures related to test security and, 
2) a failure to ensure that the LEA implemented appropriate test security measures could result in testing violations. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE continue to work on strengthening controls over proper review and 
approval of desk and on-site monitoring checklists to ensure compliance with test security. We also recommend that 
OSDE revise the Monitoring Progress Spreadsheet and the desk and on-site monitoring checklists to ensure 
monitoring procedures are performed within a reasonable timeframe to ensure the district can make changes for the 
next testing cycle, and that reviews are adequately documented.

(A) the coordinating of resources provided under this part with other resources; and 
(B) reviewing, on an ongoing basis, the progress of participating children and revising the 
targeted assistance program, if necessary, to provide additional assistance to enable such 
children to meet the State's challenging student academic achievement standards, such as an 
extended school year, before- and after-school, and summer programs and opportunities, 
training for teachers regarding how to identify students who need additional assistance, and 
training for teachers regarding how to implement student academic achievement standards 
in the classroom.” 

 
2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  While performing testwork on 20 of 191 LEAs monitored in SFY 2018, we noted the 
following issues: 
 

 For two LEAs, the monitoring tool was not completed correctly which shows a lack of proper review; 
 For one of the two LEA’s noted above, parts of the review were not completed yet the conclusion page 

showed Meets Requirements.  Therefore, the monitoring of the subaward did not provide reasonable 
assurance that the subrecipient used the subaward for authorized purposes in compliance with Federal 
statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward. 

 
While testing controls over Monitoring, we noted the following: 
 

 OSDE is not adequately verifying during monitoring that existing schoolwide plans are revised as 
necessary each year based on student needs to ensure that all students are provided opportunities to meet 
the challenging State academic standards. 

  OSDE is not adequately verifying during monitoring that existing targeted assistance plans are 1) 
reviewed, on an ongoing basis by the LEA to access the progress of participating children and 2) revised, if 
necessary, to provide additional assistance to enable such children to meet the State's challenging student 
academic achievement standards. 

 Two LEAs had a non-compliant status in the prior year (2017) [Paoli (25-I005) and Optima (70-C009)] and 
were not included on the 2018 Monitoring Log or re-monitored as required resulting in their Consolidated 
Applications for SFY 2018 being inappropriately approved as well as their SFY 2018 paid claims being 
inappropriately approved. We also noted that neither Paoli or Optima were identified on the 2018 Risk 
Assessment Tool for consolidated monitoring as having failed consolidated monitoring in the prior year. 

 
Cause: OSDE failed to ensure that the consolidated monitoring tool and the monitoring log for 2018 were 
completed appropriately and adequately reviewed.  
 
In addition, it appears that the consolidated monitoring process includes a review of the Title I Site Plan (a sample of 
a schoolwide or targeted assistance plan from at least one school); however, the District decides which site plan to 
submit and no methodology is utilized by OSDE to ensure that the complete population of all existing schoolwide 
program plans and targeted assistance plans have the possibility of being selected for review.    
 
Effect: Failure to adequately prepare, document and review the consolidated monitoring tool and the monitoring 
log for 2018 could result in Federal funds being paid to LEAs that are not in compliance with Federal statutes, 
regulations, and the terms and conditions of the award. 
 
Schools operating under schoolwide programs may not have included the required elements in the schoolwide 
program plan and, the schoolwide program plan may not have been revised as necessary each year based on student 
needs to ensure that all students are provided opportunities to meet the challenging State academic standards. In 
addition, Federal funds included in the schoolwide program may not be used to address specific educational needs 

23



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
that the school identified in the comprehensive needs assessment and that were articulated in the schoolwide 
program plan. 
 
Schools operating under targeted assistance programs may not have appropriately identified which students would 
be served under the plan and, the progress of participating children may not have been appropriately assessed on an 
ongoing basis and the LEA may not have provided adequate, additional assistance to enable such children to meet 
the State's challenging student academic achievement standards. In addition, Federal funds included in the targeted 
assistance plan may not be used to provide additional assistance to enable such children to meet the State's 
challenging student academic achievement standards. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop policies and procedures to ensure the consolidated 
monitoring tool and the monitoring log for 2018 are adequately documented, correctly completed, and reviewed 
appropriately.  We also recommend that OSDE develop policies and procedures to ensure that all schoolwide 
program sites and targeted assistance sites are included in the consolidated monitoring process.  In addition, we 
recommend OSDE ensure that an appropriate monitoring methodology is utilized to ensure that schoolwide program 
plans and targeted assistance plans come from the complete population of all schoolwide program sites and targeted 
assistance sites and have the possibility of being selected for review.

(1) Pre-approval visits. The State agency shall conduct pre-approval visits of sponsors and sites, as specified 
below, to assess the applicant sponsor's or site's potential for successful Program operations and to verify 
information provided in the application. The State agency shall visit prior to approval:  

(i) All applicant sponsors which did not participate in the program in the prior year. However, if a sponsor is a 
school food authority, has been reviewed by the State agency under the National School Lunch Program during 
the preceding 12 months, and had no significant deficiencies noted in that review, a pre-approval visit may be 
conducted at the discretion of the State agency. In addition, pre-approval visits of sponsors proposing to operate 
the Program during unanticipated school closures during the period from October through April (or at any time of 
the year in an area with a continuous school calendar) may be conducted at the discretion of the State agency;  
(ii) All applicant sponsors which, as a result of operational problems noted in the prior year, the State agency has 
determined need a pre-approval visit; and 
(iii) All sites which the State agency has determined need a pre-approval visit.  
 
(2) Sponsor and site reviews -  

(i) General. The State agency must review sponsors and sites to ensure compliance with Program regulations, the 
Department's non-discrimination regulations (7 CFR part 15) and any other applicable instructions issued by the 
Department. In determining which sponsors and sites to review, the State agency must, at a minimum, consider 
the sponsors' and sites' previous participation in the Program, their current and previous Program performance, 
and the results of previous reviews of the sponsor and sites. When the same school food authority personnel 
administer this Program as well as the National School Lunch Program (7 CFR part 210), the State agency is not 
required to conduct a review of the Program in the same year in which the National School Lunch Program 
operations have been reviewed and determined to be satisfactory.” 

 
7 CFR § 225.7(d)(5) – Program monitoring and assistance - Records states in part, “Documentation of Program 
assistance and the results of such assistance shall be maintained on file by the State agency.” 
 
Condition and Context:  We noted while testing the individual Administrative Reviews (ARs) and Summer Food 
Service Program (SFSP) Sponsor reviews that controls were not properly designed or implemented: policies and 
procedures backing up the reviews were not applied consistently and supporting documentation was not maintained.  
In addition, we noted the following issues: 
 

 One AR contained discrepancies between the AR On-site Assessment Tool and the School Food Authority 
(SFA) Data Summary Form; 

  A sample of 10% of verified applications was not selected and re-verified as required on the AR On-site 
Assessment Tool; 

 OSDE does not perform adequate procedures (calculations) to verify compliance with the following during 
the AR:  

o The SFA is actually charging students the required paid lunch price in accordance with the results 
of the PLE Tool calculations. 

o The SFA met the (PLE) equity requirement by furnishing additional funds from non-Federal 
sources. 

o The amount of non-Federal funds provided was sufficient to cover the difference between the 
amount calculated by the SFA on the approved PLE Tool and the amount actually charged for paid 
lunches. 

 
Based on the lack of design and implementation of controls for the Administrative Reviews (ARs) for the National 
School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP) and Special Milk Program (SMP), we determined 
that OSDE is not adequately documenting the procedures used to test and verify the School Food Authorities 
compliance, and OSDE is not maintaining adequate supporting documentation that would enable a reviewer to 
confirm how the consultant tested and verified the School Food Authority/ Institutions’ compliance with Child 
Nutrition Program requirements, confirm that the consultant performed the AR appropriately and, to confirm that the 
consultant’s conclusions were valid.   In addition, because adequate supporting documentation is not retained by 
OSDE, SAI is unable to audit OSDE’s compliance with the following requirements:  

25



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 

 Activities Allowed/Allowable Costs
 Eligibility (Certification, Benefit Issuance, Provision 1 & 2 & CEP Eligibility, SFSP Site Eligibility)
 Monitoring of Sub-recipients
 Verification of Free & Reduced Meals
 School Food Service Accounts (Separate accounting and 3-month operating balance)
 Paid Lunch Equity (verification of actual amounts received for paid lunches)

In addition, based on lack of design and implementation of controls over the Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) 
Sponsor reviews, we determined that OSDE is not adequately documenting the procedures used to test and verify 
the SFSP Sponsors’ compliance, and OSDE is not maintaining adequate supporting documentation that would 
enable a reviewer to confirm that the consultant performed the SFSP Sponsor Review appropriately and to confirm 
that the consultant’s conclusions were valid.   In addition, because adequate supporting documentation is not 
retained by OSDE, SAI is unable to audit OSDE’s compliance with the following requirements:   

 Activities Allowed/Allowable Costs
 Eligibility (Certification, Benefit Issuance, SFSP Site Eligibility)
 Monitoring of Sub-recipients

Cause:  We determined that high employee turnover and a lack of understanding of some of the compliance 
requirements contributed to the deficiencies noted.   

Effect: Consultants may not be conducting the AR or SFSP reviews appropriately to ensure sub-recipient 
noncompliance issues are accurately detected. 

Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop adequate policies and procedures/controls to ensure 
sufficient documentation is obtained and maintained by OSDE for all Administrative and SFSP reviews that would 
allow internal or external reviewers to evaluate whether the tests performed are appropriate and accurate and, 
whether the analysis conducted, and conclusions reached by the consultants are valid.   Additionally, we recommend 
that OSDE develop policies and procedures/controls to ensure that all AR and SFSP reviews are adequately 
reviewed based on the documentation maintained.

7 CFR § 226.6(k)(7) – Administrative reviews of institutions and responsible principals and responsible individuals 
– Results of Administrative Reviews states, “The State agency must maintain searchable records of all administrative

7 CFR § 226.6(m)(6) – Program Assistance - Frequency and number of required institution reviews states in part, 
“The State agency must review institutions according to the following schedule:  

(i)Independent centers and sponsoring organizations of 1 to 100 facilities must be reviewed at least once every
three years. A review of such a sponsoring organization must include reviews of 10 percent of the sponsoring
organization's facilities;

(ii) Sponsoring organizations with more than 100 facilities must be reviewed at least once every two years.
These reviews must include reviews of 5 percent of the first 1,000 facilities and 2.5 percent of the facilities in
excess of 1,000; and

(iii)New institutions that are sponsoring organizations of five or more facilities must be reviewed within the
first 90 days of Program operations.”

7 CFR § 226.16  (g) & (h) - Sponsoring Organization Provisions states in part,. 

4) “(g) Each sponsoring organization electing to receive advance payments of program funds for day
care homes shall disburse the full amount of such payments within five working days of receipt from the
State agency…

5) (h) Sponsoring organizations shall make payments of program funds to child care centers, adult
day care centers, emergency shelters, at-risk afterschool care centers, or outside-school-hours care centers
within five working days of receipt from the State agency, on the basis of the management plan approved
by the State agency, and may not exceed the Program costs documented at each facility during any fiscal
year; except in those States where the State agency has chosen the option to implement a meals times rates
payment system. In those States which implement this optional method of reimbursement, such
disbursements may not exceed the rates times the number of meals documented at each facility during any
fiscal year.”

Condition and Context:  We noted while testing the individual Administrative Reviews (ARs) that controls were 
not properly designed or implemented: policies and procedures backing up the reviews were not applied consistently 
and supporting documentation was not maintained.  In addition, we noted the following issues: 

 Federal funds for administrative expenses were paid to a Family Day Care Home (FDCH) Sponsor who did
not have any Administrative funds approved in their CACFP application and therefore, were not eligible
for any administrative payments.

 The amount of actual administrative expenses recorded during the site visit by the consultant on the
Administrative Cost Worksheet did not agree with the amount reported by the Sponsor on the April 2018
claim as 'Actual Administrative Costs' and the consultant did not identify the discrepancy in the AR.

 One FDCH Provider claimed 23 meals in excess of the number of children in attendance as reported in the
5-day reconciliation on the AR Tool and the consultant did not identify the discrepancy on the AR Tool.

 The percentage of Providers not at home when the consultant conducted the site visits (50%) exceeded the
serious deficiency threshold (25%), however, no serious deficiency was noted on the CACFP AR Tool.

 The Percentage Error Worksheet was calculated incorrectly causing the error rates used to identify serious
deficiencies in meal components, quantities and counting and claiming to be substantially lower than it
appears they should have been.

27



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 

 The number of children and hours of attendance reported on the 5-day reconciliation substantially exceeded
the home’s license capacity for one FDCH Provider and the consultant did not identify the discrepancy in
the AR.

 The 5-day reconciliation procedures performed for FDCH Providers who claim shift meals was inadequate
to determine if the provider was within the license capacity for all meals served.

 The Estimate of Milk Needed form was not completed correctly and did not agree with the corresponding
claim for one Sponsor.

 The dates on the 5-day reconciliation were inconsistent with the dates on the meal components and
quantities worksheet.

During our control testwork related to Administrative Review tracking of the frequency and number of required 
reviews, we noted the following issues:   

 121 Independent centers, sponsoring organizations of centers with 1 to 100 centers, and sponsoring
organizations of day care homes with 1 to 100 homes were not reviewed at least once every three years.

 Two Sponsoring organizations with more than 100 homes were not reviewed at least once every two years.
 A review was not conducted for one newly participating sponsoring organization with five or more child

care facilities within the first 90 days of program operations.

Based on the lack of design and implementation of controls over Administrative Reviews for the Child and Adult 
Care Food Program, we determined that OSDE is not adequately documenting the procedures used to test and verify 
the CACFP institutions compliance and, OSDE is not maintaining adequate supporting documentation that would 
enable a reviewer to confirm that the consultant performed the AR appropriately and to confirm that the consultant’s 
conclusions were valid.   In addition, because adequate supporting documentation is not retained by OSDE, SAI is 
unable to audit OSDE’s compliance with the following requirements: 

 Activities Allowed/Allowable Costs
 Cash Management - Sponsoring organization must disburse advance and meal reimbursement

payments to centers and day care homes under its sponsorship within five working days of receiving
them from its State agency

 Eligibility (Individual participant eligibility, Categorical eligibility)
 Monitoring of Subrecipients

Cause: It appears that turnover of staff within the Child Nutrition Program department resulted in a failure to 
adequately review the CACFP Administrative Review Tracking Log which resulted in the sites not being reviewed 
timely.  

In addition, we determined that high employee turnover and a lack of understanding of some of the compliance 
requirements contributed to the deficiencies noted.   

Effect: OSDE is not in compliance with 7 CFR § 226.6(k)(7) and 7 CFR § 226.6(m)(6). In addition, consultants may 
not be conducting the AR reviews appropriately to ensure subrecipient noncompliance issues are accurately detected 
since appropriate documentation is not maintained. 

Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop adequate policies and procedures/controls to ensure 
sufficient information and documentation is obtained and maintained by OSDE for all CACFP Administrative 
Reviews that would allow a reviewer to evaluate whether the tests performed are appropriate and accurate and, 
whether the analysis conducted, and conclusions reached by the consultants are valid.   Additionally, we recommend 
that OSDE develop policies and procedures/controls to ensure that Administrative Reviews cover the frequency and 
number of required institutions.

of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring, which may include 
consideration of such factors as: 

(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;

(2) The results of previous audits including whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in
accordance with Subpart F - Audit Requirements of this part, and the extent to which the same or
similar subaward has been audited as a major program;

(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and

(4) The extent and results of Federal awarding agency monitoring (e.g., if the subrecipient also
receives Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency).”

2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 

Condition and Context:  The OSDE Child Nutrition Department has not implemented  risk assessment procedures 
to evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of the Child Nutrition Program subawards for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient 
monitoring. In addition, OSDE does not have any procedures to 1) identify LEAs that have a demonstrated level of, 
or are at high risk for, administrative error and 2) perform the required Additional Administrative Reviews (AARs). 

Cause: It appears that staff turnover within the OSDE Child Nutrition Department along with changes to the OMB 
compliance requirements resulted in a lag in implementing this new requirement.  

Effect: Failure to properly evaluate risk for subrecipient monitoring may lead to an increased risk of noncompliance 
by the subgrantees with the terms and conditions of the Child Nutrition Program subawards.  

Recommendation: We recommend that the Oklahoma State Department of Education immediately develop and 
implement the required risk assessment processes to ensure that each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with

Criteria:  2 CFR § 200.331(b) – Requirements for pass-through entities states, “All pass-through entities must 
evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring, which may include 
consideration of such factors as: 
 

(1) The subrecipient's prior experience with the same or similar subawards;  

(2) The results of previous audits including whether or not the subrecipient receives a Single Audit in 
accordance with Subpart F - Audit Requirements of this part, and the extent to which the same or 
similar subaward has been audited as a major program;  

(3) Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and  

(4) The extent and results of Federal awarding agency monitoring (e.g., if the subrecipient also 
receives Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency).” 

2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  The OSDE Child Nutrition Department has not implemented  risk assessment procedures 
to evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of the Child and Adult Care Food Program subawards for purposes of determining the appropriate 
subrecipient monitoring.

Criteria: Per 2 CFR §200.501(b), “Single audit. A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or more during the 
non-Federal entity's fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single audit conducted….” 
 
2 CFR § 200.331 states in part, “All pass-through entities must: . . . (f) Verify that every subrecipient is audited as 
required by Subpart F—Audit Requirements of this part when it is expected that the subrecipient's Federal awards 
expended during the respective fiscal year equaled or exceeded the threshold set forth in §200.501 Audit 
requirements.” 
 
2 CFR § 200.512(a)(1) Report submission states in part, “The audit must be completed and the data collection form 
described in paragraph (b) of this section and reporting package described in paragraph (c) of this section must be 
submitted within the earlier of 30 calendar days after receipt of the auditor's report(s), or nine months after the end 
of the audit period. If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package is due the 
next business day.” 
 
2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award.” 
 
Condition and Context:  Based on review of subrecipient monitoring controls, it appears more CACFP institutions 
exceeded the $750,000 threshold in Federal funds expended than are included on the Department’s Audit Log for 
audits due in calendar year 2018. We determined that OSDE’s current control process of obtaining each agency’s 
federal expenditures for their prior fiscal year at the time the CACFP application is submitted (September ’17 for 
our audit) has resulted in 1) audits not being submitted on time based largely on subrecipient not finding out timely 
an audit is required, and 2) some required single audits are not being submitted at all.   
  
While performing test work on 15 of 54 subrecipient audits with due dates in SFY 2018, we noted the following 
issues: 

 For 5 audits tested, the audit was received after the due date, and no letter was sent stating the audit must be 
received within 15 days of receipt or the subrecipient will be considered seriously deficient; 

 For 2 audits tested, the audit was received after the due date, but a letter was sent stating the audit must be 
received within 15 days of receipt or the subrecipient will be considered seriously deficient; 

 For 1 audit tested, OSDE did not actually receive the audit and the omission was not identified. 
 
Cause: It appears that the Funds Received – CACFP/FDCH’ Report in the CACFP application does not clearly state 
the fiscal year the subrecipient is providing expenditures for, which results in inaccurate and incomplete audit logs 
as OSDE cannot adequately verify what fiscal year’s data they are receiving from the subrecipient. Also, depending 
on the subrecipients fiscal year end, OSDE may not identify subrecipients that require a single audit until close to or 

31



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
after the due date for the audit.   Lastly, the Department does not list the type of entity and fiscal year end when 
evaluating all subrecipients over 750k. 
 
Effect: Not all audits are being received and/or performed in accordance with 2 CFR § 200.501(b), 2 CFR § 
200.331, and 2 CFR § 200.512(a)(1).  In addition, we are unable to determine the exact number of additional audits 
that should have been received based on the current control structure for gathering subrecipient federal expenditures. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop and implement a system to track all subrecipient audits on a 
monthly basis to ensure that all audits are received and in a timely manner.  In addition, we recommend OSDE 
develop and implement procedures on how subrecipient audits that are submitted late will be handled.

Criteria: 2 CFR § 200.303(a) – Internal Controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must establish and maintain 
effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is 
managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the 
Federal award.” 

Condition and Context:  Based on our sample of 60 Local Education Agencies (LEA’s) tested for Eligibility, we 
noted the following: 
 

 8 district reviews where accreditation status reported on the SFY 2017 Accreditation Compliance Visit 
audit documentation does not support the accreditation status of the LEA listed on the Accreditation 
Recommendation Master List;  

 1 district review where Accreditation Master List matched the accreditation documentation; however, the 
Accreditation Compliance Visit form was incomplete because the Regional Accreditation Officer did not 
answer two questions.   

 1 district review where the Accreditation List matched the accreditation documentation, however code 413 
stated the following "If an adjunct teacher is employed, has the district a) obtained local board approval; b) 
processed a felony search report; c) notified SDE appropriately when required.  This question was marked 
no; which should have resulted in accreditation with one deficiency but was not. 

 
Cause: Based on discussion with the OSDE Accreditation Department, for the 8 districts with accreditation status 
discrepancies, the Department was not able to identify why the accreditation status reported on the Accreditation 
Compliance Visit forms did not agree with the Accreditation Recommendation Master List  In addition, the 
Department does not have adequate procedures in place to ensure the results from the Accreditation Compliance 
Visit reconciles to the Accreditation Recommendation Master List.   Lastly, for the two districts for which the 
reviewer responses on the Accreditation Compliance Visit form matched the accreditation status reported on the 
Accreditation Master list, the results did not appear to be properly reviewed.

Effect: We determined that there were no districts tested for which the discrepancies noted would have resulted in 
the district not being accredited. However, inadequate controls over the accreditation process could result in serious 
accreditation issues not being appropriately identified and addressed. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop appropriate policies and procedures to ensure 1) the 
Accreditation Compliance Visit forms are adequately reviewed by someone other than the preparer and, 2) the 
district’s accreditation status is reported correctly.

its approval or disapproval. If an incomplete application is received, the State agency shall so notify the applicant 
within 15 days and shall provide technical assistance for the purpose of completing the application…” 

OSDE internal policy requires that Summer Food Service Programs (SFSP) institutions have an approved 
application before claims can be submitted and paid.   
 
Condition and Context:  While testing 40 of 180 Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) institutions with claims 
paid during FY17, we noted the following issues: 
 

 For 11 institutions, the FY17 SFSP Application was not submitted to the State agency by June 15, 2017. 
 For 7 institutions, the FY17 SFSP Application was not submitted by the institution or approved by OSDE 

prior to payment of the first claim. 
 For 2 institutions, the FY17 SFSP Application was submitted by the institution but not approved by OSDE 

prior to payment of the first claim. 
 One institution did not have an approved FY17 SFSP Application, however, 4 claims totaling $61,519.07 

were paid to the institution.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
Cause: It appears that turnover of staff within the Child Nutrition Program department contributed to the lack of 
controls over    SFSP application submission and approvals. In addition, it appears that inadequate system edits 
allowed the payment of FY17 claims when the institution did not have an approved FY17 SFSP application. 
 
Effect: Failure to ensure SFSP applications are properly approved could result in ineligible subrecipients receiving 
Federal funds.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop appropriate policies and procedures to 1) ensure SFSP 
applications are submitted and approved timely, and 2) ensure claims are not paid prior to application submission 
and approval.

the date of the enactment of the Every Student Succeeds Act) that— 

(1) is developed during a 1-year period, unless—

time is needed to develop and implement the schoolwide program;” or 
(B) the school is operating a schoolwide program on the day before the date of the 
enactment of the Every Student Succeeds Act, in which case such school may continue to 
operate such program, but shall develop amendments to its existing plan during the first 
year of assistance after that date to reflect the provisions of this section” 

 
34 CFR § 200.77 - Reservation of funds by an LEA states in part, “Before allocating funds in accordance with §

OSDE Internal Policy stipulates that a 1% Homeless set-aside is required for LEAs with non-Title I sites in 
accordance with ESSA, Section 1113(c)(3)(A). 
 
Condition and Context:  While documenting controls over Eligibility, we noted that OSDE has not ensured that 
existing schoolwide plans were amended to reflect the provisions of Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). 
 
In addition, for our sample of 40 of 540 LEA consolidated applications tested for Eligibility, we noted that for 8 
LEAs the set-aside was less than 1% of the total current year allocations (plus transfers in) for homeless children. 
 
Cause:   OSDE did not have controls in place to ensure that schoolwide plans were amended for provisions of 
ESSA. 
 
In addition, the Federal Programs department failed to adequately review the homeless set-aside amounts on the 
GMS consolidated applications.  
 
Effect: Schools operating under schoolwide programs may not have included the components required under the 
provisions of Every Student Succeeds Act in the schoolwide program plans, and therefore may not be in compliance 
with eligibility re-determination compliance requirements.  
 
Failure to set aside the appropriate amount of funds for homeless children could result in services for homeless 
children not being provided as required.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop policies and procedures to ensure that existing schoolwide 
program plans are amended appropriately to reflect the provisions of Every Student Succeeds Act. 
 
We also recommend OSDE develop policies and procedures to ensure an adequate review is performed on the 
amounts set-aside for homeless services.

(2) Ensure that teachers and families of participating private school children participate on a basis equitable 
to the participation of teachers and families of public school children receiving these services in accordance 
with § 200.65.  

(b)  
(1) Eligible private school children are children who -  

(i) Reside in participating public school attendance areas of the LEA, regardless of whether the private 
school they attend is located in the LEA; and  
(ii) Meet the criteria in section 1115(b) of the ESEA.  

(2) Among the eligible private school children, the LEA must select children to participate, consistent with 
§ 200.64.  

(c) The services and other benefits an LEA provides under this section must be secular, neutral and 
nonideological.” 

 
34 CFR 200.64 - Factors for determining equitable participation of private school children states in part,  

 “(a)Equal expenditures.  
(1) Funds expended by an LEA under subpart A of this part for services for eligible private school children 
in the aggregate must be equal to the amount of funds generated by private school children from low-
income families under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.  
(2) An LEA must meet this requirement as follows:  

(i)  
(A) If the LEA reserves funds under § 200.77 to provide instructional and related activities for public 
elementary or secondary school students at the district level, the LEA must also provide from those 
funds, as applicable, equitable services to eligible private school children.  
(B) The amount of funds available to provide equitable services from the applicable reserved funds 
must be proportionate to the number of private school children from low-income families residing in 
participating public school attendance areas.  

(ii) The LEA must reserve the funds generated by private school children under § 200.78 and, in 
consultation with appropriate officials of the private schools, may -  

(A) Combine those amounts, along with funds under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, if appropriate, 
to create a pool of funds from which the LEA provides equitable services to eligible private school 
children, in the aggregate, in greatest need of those services; or  
(B) Provide equitable services to eligible children in each private school with the funds generated by 
children from low-income families under § 200.78 who attend that private school.  

(b)Services on an equitable basis.  
(1) The services that an LEA provides to eligible private school children must be equitable in comparison 
to the services and other benefits that the LEA provides to public school children participating under 
subpart A of this part.  
(2) Services are equitable if the LEA -  

(i) Addresses and assesses the specific needs and educational progress of eligible private school children 
on a comparable basis as public school children;  
(ii) Meets the equal expenditure requirements under paragraph (a) of section; and  
(iii) Provides private school children with an opportunity to participate that -  

(A) Is equitable to the opportunity provided to public school children; and  
(B) Provides reasonable promise of the private school children achieving the high levels called for by 
the State's student academic achievement standards or equivalent standards applicable to the private 
school children.” 

 
ESEA SEC. 1117 (a) (4) (A) Determination,  states, 
 
“(i) In General.—Expenditures for educational services and other benefits to eligible private school children shall be 
equal to the proportion of funds allocated to participating school attendance areas based on the number of children 
from low-income families who attend private schools.

(ii) Proportional Share.—The proportional share of funds shall be determined based on the total amount of funds 
received by the local educational agency under this part prior to any allowable expenditures or transfers by the local 
educational agency.” 
 
According to the Title I Non-Regulatory Guidance: Fiscal Changes and Equitable Services Requirements section N-
7, the following provisions are applicable for private school carry-over funds:    
 

“In general, to ensure that equitable services are provided in a timely manner, an LEA must obligate the 
funds allocated for equitable services under all applicable programs in the year for which they are 
appropriated.  (ESEA sections 1117(a)(4)(B) and 8501(a)(4)(B).)  There may be extenuating 
circumstances, however, in which an LEA is unable to obligate all funds within this timeframe in a 
responsible manner.  Under these circumstances, the funds may remain available for the provision of 
equitable services under the respective program during the subsequent school year.  In determining how 
such carryover funds will be used, the LEA must consult with appropriate private school officials.  
(ESEA sections 1117(b) and 8501(c).)” 

 
Condition and Context:  While documenting controls over Participation of Private School Children under Title I 
Part A, we noted that OSDE does not have policies or procedures to verify that 1) equitable services for private 
school students were actually provided, and  2) funds allocated for equitable services are obligated in the year for 
which they were appropriated, or,   adequate verification of extenuating circumstances is documented for  amounts 
that should have been used to provide services to private school children in the current year but are carried forward 
to be used to provide services to private school children in the following year . 
 
In addition, while performing testwork on 6 of the 13 LEA’s for equitable participation of private school children 
under Title I Part A, we noted the following issues: 
 

 For one LEA they budgeted the private school expenditures under function 1000, code 600 instead of 
function 5500, code 600, indicating that the funds were to be spent from the public share of funds. 
However, we noticed that the LEA did not spend the amount budgeted under function 1000, code 600 for 
the private school either; therefore, no equitable services were provided, and the discrepancies were not 
identified in the review process; 

 For two LEAs, the amount allocated for private school students on the Low- Income step #4 of the 
Consolidated Application did not agree with the budgeted amount for private school services and, it 
appears that the LEAs failed to set aside the required amount for private school children. In addition, the 
discrepancies were not identified in the review process; 

 For five LEAs, it does not appear that all private school educational services that were planned were 
provided; 

 For five LEAs, it does not appear that funds allocated for equitable services were obligated in the year for 
which they were appropriated and, it also appears that the LEAs did not have appropriate extenuating 
circumstances related to the amount of unobligated funds.   

 
Cause: It appears that OSDE does not have adequate policies and procedures to verify the following: 

 All participating private school children are included in the allocation process;  
 Equitable services for private school students were actually provided, and  
 Funds allocated for equitable services are obligated in the year for which they were appropriated, or, 

adequate verification of extenuating circumstances is documented for amounts carried forward in the 
following year. 

 
Also, it appears that discrepancies in the Consolidated Applications were not identified due to inadequate review 
procedures.  
 
Effect: Inadequate policies and procedures and an inadequate review process could result in a failure to provide 
equitable services to Private/ Nonpublic School children.

34 CFR § 299.7 What are the factors for determining equitable participation of children and teachers in private 
schools? – states, 
 

“(a)Equal expenditures.  
(1) Expenditures of funds made by an agency or consortium of agencies under a program listed in § 299.6 
(b) for services for eligible private school children and their teachers and other educational personnel must 
be equal on a per-pupil basis to the amount of funds expended for participating public school children and

their teachers and other educational personnel, taking into account the number and educational needs of 
those children and their teachers and other educational personnel.  
(2) Before determining equal expenditures under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an agency or consortium 
of agencies shall pay for the reasonable and necessary administrative costs of providing services to public 
and private school children and their teachers and other educational personnel from the agency's or 
consortium of agencies' total allocation of funds under the applicable ESEA program. 
  

(b)Services on an equitable basis.  
(1) The services that an agency or consortium of agencies provides to eligible private school children and 
their teachers and other educational personnel must also be equitable in comparison to the services and 
other benefits provided to public school children and their teachers or other educational personnel 
participating in a program under this subpart.”  

 
According to the Title II Non-Regulatory Guidance, the following provisions are applicable for private school carry-
over funds:    
 

“In general, to ensure that equitable services are provided in a timely manner, an LEA must obligate the 
funds allocated for equitable services under all applicable programs in the year for which they are 
appropriated.  (ESEA sections 1117(a)(4)(B) and 8501(a)(4)(B).)  There may be extenuating 
circumstances, however, in which an LEA is unable to obligate all funds within this timeframe in a 
responsible manner.  Under these circumstances, the funds may remain available for the provision of 
equitable services under the respective program during the subsequent school year.  In determining how 
such carryover funds will be used, the LEA must consult with appropriate private school officials.  
(ESEA sections 1117(b) and 8501(c).)” 

 
ESEA SEC. 1117 (a) (4) (A) Determination, states, 
 

“(i) In General. —Expenditures for educational services and other benefits to eligible private school 
children shall be equal to the proportion of funds allocated to participating school attendance areas based 
on the number of children from low-income families who attend private schools. 
(ii) Proportional Share. —The proportional share of funds shall be determined based on the total amount of 
funds received by the local educational agency under this part prior to any allowable expenditures or 
transfers by the local educational agency.” 

 
20 U.S. Code § 7881(a)(4). Participation by private school children and teachers – Private School Participation – 
Expenditures 
               – states: 

“(B) Obligation of funds  
Funds allocated to a local educational agency for educational services and other benefits to eligible private 
school children shall be obligated in the fiscal year for which the funds are received by the agency.” 

The U.S. Department of Education publication Title II, Part A – Teacher and Principal Training and Recruiting 
Fund Equitable Services to Private School Teachers, states in part: 
 

“G-2. What is meant by “equitable participation? 
Participation is considered to be equitable if the public and private educational agencies and institutions:  
(1) assess, address, and evaluate the needs and progress of both groups of teachers in the same manner; (2) 
provide approximately the same amount of training and, where appropriate, instruction to teachers with 
similar needs; (3) spend an equal amount of funds per student to serve public and private school teachers; 
and (4) provide private school teachers with an opportunity to participate in Title II, Part A program 
activities equivalent to the opportunity provided public school teachers. 
 
….

G-9. Must the expenditures that the LEA provides for professional development for private school teachers 
be equal on a per-pupil basis?  
 
Title IX, Section 9501 of ESEA requires that Title II, Part A services for professional development that are 
provided to private school teachers and other educational personnel be equitable in comparison to those 
provided to public school teachers.  It also requires that funds provided for professional development for 
private school teachers be equal on a per-pupil basis.” 

 
Condition and Context:  While documenting controls over Participation of Private School Children under Title II 
Part A, we noted that OSDE does not have policies or procedures to verify that 1) equitable services for private 
school students were actually provided, and 2) funds allocated for equitable services are obligated in the year for 
which they were appropriated, or,   adequate verification of extenuating circumstances is documented for amounts 
that should have been used to provide services to private school children in the current year but are carried forward 
to be used to provide services to private school children in the following year. 
 
In addition, while performing testwork on 12 of 27 LEA’s for equitable participation of private school children 
under Title II Part A, we noted the following issues 
 

 For five LEAs, the amount budgeted for Title IIA private schools (account code 5500) does not agree with 
the amount calculated by the GMS on the Private /Nonpublic Schools share page of the Title IIA 
application (line 8) and the review did not identify the discrepancy. 

 For five LEAs, the required amount was not set aside (budgeted) for private school children; 
 For eleven LEAs, OSDE did not appropriately verify that the educational services that were planned were 

provided; 
 For eleven LEAs, it does not appear that funds allocated for equitable services were obligated in the year 

for which they were appropriated and, it also appears that the LEAs did not have appropriate extenuating 
circumstances related to the amount of unobligated funds.   

 For nine LEAs, expenditures are not equal on a per-pupil basis for public and private school students, 
teachers and other educational personnel, taking into consideration their numbers and needs as required by 
34 CFR section 299.7. 
 

Cause: It appears that OSDE does not have adequate policies and procedures to review/verify the following:  
 

 Private/ Nonpublic School allocations are calculated correctly and the appropriate amounts are set 
aside for private school children; 

 Equitable services for private school students were actually provided, and  
 Funds allocated for equitable services are obligated in the year for which they were appropriated, or 

adequate verification of extenuating circumstances is documented for amounts carried forward in the 
following year. 

 Amounts that should have been used to provide services to private school children in the current year 
are carried forward to be used to provide services to private school children in the following year.  

 
Also, it appears that discrepancies in the Consolidated Applications were not identified due to inadequate review 
procedures.  
 
Effect: Inadequate policies and procedures and an inadequate review process could result in a failure to provide 
equitable services to Private/ Nonpublic School children. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that OSDE develop appropriate policies and procedures to verify the following: 
 

 Private/ Nonpublic School allocations are calculated correctly and, the appropriate amounts are set 
aside for private school children;  

 Equitable services for private school students are actually provided, and

FEMA Public Assistance Program Interim Guidance on 2 CFR Part 200: VI Guidance Details states, “On December 
26, 2014, DHS adopted, in its entirety, 2 C.F.R. Part 200 through 79 FR 75871, which supersedes and streamlines 
requirements from OMB Circulars A-21, A-87, A-110, and A-122 (which have been placed in OMB guidance, 
including 2 C.F.R. Parts 215, 220, 225, and 230); OMB Circulars A-89, A-102, and A-133; and the guidance in 
OMB Circular A-50 on Single Audit Act follow-up. At the same time, FEMA removed Part 13 from Title 44 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations. These superseded OMB Circulars and guidance, including 44 C.F.R. Part 13, will 
continue to apply to Federal awards made under emergency or major disaster 
declarations declared prior to December 26, 2014. 
 
44 CFR § 13.26 – Non-Federal audit states, “(a) Basic rule: Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining 
audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507); 31 U.S.C. 503, 1111; 
Executive Order 8248; Executive Order 11541; and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local 
Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance 
with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits. (b) Subgrantees: State or local 
governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide 
Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $500,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal 
awards in a fiscal year, shall: (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of 
the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A-110, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for 
Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” have 
met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental 
organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit 
performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied 
with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds; (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent 
Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by 
reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., 
program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit; (3) Ensure that appropriate corrective action is taken 
within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations; 

41

(4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and (5) Require each
subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.”

Applicable to FEMA-4222, FEMA-4247, FEMA-4256, FEMA-4274, FEMA-4299, FEMA-4315, FEMA-4324:  

2 CFR § 200.501 - Audit requirements states, “(a) Audit required. A non-Federal entity that expends $750,000 or 
more during the non-Federal entity’s fiscal year in Federal awards must have a single or program-specific audit 
conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of this part.” 

Condition and Context: The Department did not track subgrantees that expended over $750,000 in total federal 
expenditures (from all agencies) for their most recent fiscal year. 

Cause: The Department did not have procedures/internal controls in place to ensure that subgrantees’ total federal 
expenditures are being tracked for a given fiscal year.  For Public Assistance grant funds, the department failed to 
track those subgrantees that had an approved Project Worksheet(s) (PW) and the associated expenditures for that 
same fiscal year.   

Effect: The Department is unaware of whether subrecipients complied with the Single Audit requirement for their 
most recent fiscal year end. In addition, the Department is unaware of potential subgrantee Single Audits with 
noncompliance issues related to the Public Assistance program. Lastly, the Department has failed to ensure that 
subgrantees took appropriate corrective action on any relevant findings within the required timeframe.   

Recommendation: We recommend the Department develop policies and procedures/internal controls to ensure that 
all subgrantees subject to Single Audit requirements are tracked for a given fiscal year.

2 CFR § 200.303 (a) – Internal Control states, “The Non-Federal entity must:  Establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the 
Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated 
Framework”, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 

Condition and Context: While testing a sample of 13 draws out of a total population of 40 draws, we noted the 
following: 

 Eleven draws were made prior to payment to the subrecipient.
 One draw appears to be for State share payments in the amount of $19,632.30.
 All three draws for advances do not appear to ensure that the time elapsing between the transfer of federal

funds to the subrecipient and the disbursement of such funds for program purpose were minimized.

Cause: For the eleven draws the Department did not have adequate procedures/controls in place to ensure 
subrecipient payments were made at least 6 days prior to the draw. In addition, the state share was drawn down and 
the Department did not adequately review support prior to making the draw. Lastly, for the advance draws, the 
Department did not perform during the award monitoring to ensure the time elapsing between the transfer of funds 
and disbursement were minimized.    

Effect: The Department is not complying with 31 CFR § 205, 2018 Treasury State Agreement, or 2 CFR § 
200.305(b)(1).  In addition, the Department was not tracking the extent of interest events applicable for the fiscal 
year. 

Recommendation: We recommend the Department develop policies and procedures to ensure draws are made in 
accordance with the clearance pattern for the program. In addition, we recommend the Department develop policies 
and procedures to ensure that draws made for advances payments are monitored during the award.

monitoring must cover each program, function or activity”

2 CFR § 200.331(d) – Requirements for pass-through entities states, “All pass-through entities must Monitor the 
activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes, in compliance

non-Federal entity in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project.” 
 
Applicable to all disasters: A component objective of an effective internal control system is to ensure accurate and 
reliable information through a process of proper review and approval. 
 
Condition and Context: We reviewed all advances and identified $21,305,714.41 that was advanced during SFY 
2018 to subgrantees without ensuring supported activities were in compliance with applicable Federal requirements 
prior to the closeout of the project. The advances represent 40% of the funds provided to subgrantees during the 
fiscal year. In addition, the Department did not ensure that the subgrantee had the willingness and the ability to 
maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement. Also, 

44



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
the Department did not evaluate each subgrantee’s risk of noncompliance to determine the appropriate subrecipient 
monitoring. 
 
In addition, for our sample of 10 of the 29 advance payments made to subgrantees, we noted the following: 

 All ten advances were not made in accordance with 44 CFR 13.21(c) as OEM failed to monitor the 
subrecipient to ensure the time was minimized between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the 
subrecipient; 

 One Request for Advance or Reimbursement Form (15-Alpha)/Payment Request Form payment was 
approved as an advance; however, the payment appears to meet the definition of a reimbursement; 

 Two State extensions for the associated Project Worksheets (PW) were not maintained; therefore, we were 
unable to determine if they were approved. 
 

Cause: The Department did not have during the award monitoring procedures/internal controls in place to ensure 
that funds advanced to subgrantees were being used in compliance with applicable Federal requirements and to 
ensure that the subgrantee had the willingness and the ability to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of 
the funds and their disbursement. The Department did not implement procedures to ensure that the time elapsing 
between the transfer of Federal funds to the subrecipient and the disbursement of such funds for program purposes 
by the subrecipient was minimized. In addition, the Department did not have procedures/internal controls to evaluate 
each subrecipient’s risk of noncompliance. 
 
Lastly, the Department did not properly review the Request for Advance or Reimbursement Form (15-
Alpha)/Payment Request Form to ensure that the payment met the definition of an advance and failed to maintain 
proper safeguard controls over State approved extensions. 
 
Effect: The Department is not in compliance with the requirements of 44 CFR 13.40 (a), 44 CFR 13.21 (c), 2 CFR 
200.331 (d), and 2 CFR 200.305 (b) (1) for advance payments. Also, it appears that the Department is not in 
compliance with the requirements of 2 CFR 200.331(b). As a result, failure to perform during the award monitoring 
of subgrantees for advance payments could lead to federal funds not being disbursed timely and/or in accordance 
with Federal regulations. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Department develop policies and procedures/internal controls to ensure 
subgrantees receiving advance funds are monitored prior to the closeout of the project to ensure compliance with the 
applicable Federal regulations, ensure that subgrantees are minimizing the time between the receipt of funds and 
their disbursement, and to evaluate each subrecipient’s risk of noncompliance. Lastly, we recommend the 
Department closely review the Request for Advance or Reimbursement Form (15-Alpha)/Payment Request Form 
prior to payment to ensure the correct payment method is selected.

Criteria: The instructions for SF-425 for line 10b – Cash Disbursements states, “enter the cumulative amount of 
Federal fund disbursements by the grantee (such as cash or checks) as of the reporting period end date. 
Disbursements are the sum of actual cash disbursements (of Federally authorized funds) for direct charges for goods 
and services, the amount of indirect expenses charged to the award, and the amount of cash advances and payments 
(of Federally authorized funds) made to subrecipients and contractors.” 
 
The instructions for SF-425a for line 10b – Cumulative Federal Cash Disbursements states, “enter the cumulative 
amount of the Federal share of cash disbursed for each award. Cash disbursements are the sum of actual cash 
disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expenses charged to the award, and 
the amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients and contractors.” 
Per 2 CFR §200.62, “Internal control over compliance requirements for Federal awards means a process 
implemented by a non-Federal entity designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the 
following objectives for Federal awards: (a) Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for, in order to: (1) 
Permit the preparation of reliable financial statements and Federal reports.” 
 
2 CFR § 200.303 (a) – Internal Control states, “The non-Federal entity must: Establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the 
Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated 
Framework”, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information. In addition, a key element of internal controls is the performance of a reconciliation of funds between 
the agency and external records. The reconciliation process is essential because it ensures that accounting records 
are accurate and errors are detected and corrected in a timely manner. 
 
Condition and Context:  The Department is responsible for reporting cumulative disbursements (line 10b) for each 
open disaster on the SF-425 and SF-425a quarterly to FEMA.   Since we were unable to rely on the 6/30/17 SF-425 
reports, we started with the 6/30/16 SF-425 reports and added subrecipient and management costs for the last two 
years to get to the 6/30/18 totals that should have been reported.  We then compared the amounts reported at 6/30/18 
on the SF-425 and SF-425a (in Column F) to what we calculated and noted the following variances for the disasters 
reported:

Effect: The Department understated the cumulative amount of the cash disbursements at 6/30/18 for all open Public 
Assistance disasters by approximately $42,273,036 on the SF-425 and $70,400,454 on the SF-425a. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Department of Emergency Management develop policies and 
procedures/internal controls to ensure that the amounts and disasters reported on the SF-425 and SF-425a are 
calculated in accordance with the instructions and agree to the accounting records. Also, we recommend the 
Department perform an adequate and timely reconciliation of SF-425a and SF-425 prior to submitting to FEMA.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 

Cause: It appears the Department calculated the cash basis expenditure amount and current year Federal accounts 
payable based on the accounting date entered into the statewide accounting system rather than when the expense 
occurred, and the error was not detected during review. In addition, it appears the Department did not maintain 
support for the cash basis expenditures reported to the Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) on 
10/25/18 as part of the CAFR reporting. 

Effect: The Department’s total federal expenditures were overstated by $13,091,827. 

Recommendation: We recommend the Department review the current procedures and implement the necessary 
controls to ensure accurate reporting of total federal expenditures on the SEFA.

(b) Transactions are executed in compliance with: (1) Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of 
the Federal award that could have a direct and material effect on a Federal program. . . .”

2 CFR 200.403 (a) Factors affecting allowability of costs states,  “Except  where  otherwise authorized by statute, 
costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under Federal awards:
Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these 
principles.”

2 CFR 200.431 (c) Compensation – fringe benefits states, . . . “Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards 
and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of 
employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as 
direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.” 

A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   

Condition and Context: The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) informed agencies in February 
2018 that any excess Pathfinder contributions (account code 513300 in the Statewide Accounting System) that went 
to the OPERS defined benefit plan would not be allowed to be charged to Federal grants. The Federal government 
maintains that the amount used to fund the defined benefit plan is an overcharge to Federal programs. As a result, 
OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 2016) 
through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point would be 
required to repay on their own. 

When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for OEM, we noted of the total $61,323, $45,777 was charged to the 
Federal grant Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) – CFDA #97.042 during SFY  2018. Of the 
$45,777 of unallowable costs charged to Federal grants for state fiscal year 2018, $11,010 was charged from 2/21/18 
to 6/30/18. Based on our discussion with the Department and review of the employees whose time was charged to 
the EMPG, it appears that a large portion of those Pathfinder unallowable costs applied to the Public Assistance 
grant.  

The remaining $15,546 was state charges to E-911 Grant for class-fund 22000 and appropriated costs from class 
fund 19801(non-Federal).  

Cause: The Department was unaware that excess Pathfinder contributions were an unallowable charge until they 
were made aware by OMES.   

In addition, it appears the Department did not have a proper way  of  allocating  costs  as  the  Federal  share  of  all  
management costs were charged to EMPG regardless of what Federal grant they worked on. 

Effect: Of the total $45,777 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to Federal programs, and required to be 
reimbursed to the Federal agency, the Department is responsible for the amount of $11,010, and OMES is 
responsible for the amount of $34,767. 

The Federal share of management costs charged to OEM’s Federal grants have not been charged according to actual 
time worked on the grant.  

Recommendation: We recommend the Department develop and implement procedures to ensure Pathfinder excess 
contributions (account 513300) are not charged to Federal grants.  In addition, we recommend the Department 
develop and implement procedures to ensure management costs for Federal grants are charged according to actual 
time worked on the grant.

FEDERAL PROGRAM NAME:  Unemployment Insurance 
FEDERAL AWARD NUMBER:  N/A – Related to Payments from Employers 
FEDERAL AWARD YEAR:  2017 and 2018  
CONTROL CATEGORY:  Special Tests and Provisions 
QUESTIONED COSTS: $0 
 
Criteria: 2 C.F.R. §200.303(a) states in part, “The non-Federal entity must: Establish and maintain effective 
internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing 
the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal 
award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the 
Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated 
Framework”, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
42 U.S. Code § 503 (a) (11) states, “The Secretary of Labor shall make no certification for payment to any State 
unless he finds that the law of such State, approved by the Secretary of Labor under the Federal Unemployment Tax 
Act [26 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.], includes provision for -  

(A) At the time the State agency determines an erroneous payment from its unemployment fund was made to an 
individual due to fraud committed by such individual, the assessment of a penalty on the individual in an 
amount of not less than 15 percent of the amount of the erroneous payment; and   

(B) The immediate deposit of all assessments paid pursuant to subparagraph (A) into the unemployment fund 
of the State.” 
 

40 O.S. § 2-613 (1) states, “Fraud overpayment: in which an individual intentionally makes a false statement or 
representation or fails to disclose a material fact, and has received any sum as benefits to which the individual was 
not entitled. The individual shall be liable to repay this sum, plus a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the 
amount of the original overpayment and interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month on the unpaid balance of 
the overpayment, to the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. Three-fifths (3/5) of the penalty amount 
collected shall be deposited in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the State of Oklahoma and the remaining two-
fifths (2/5) shall be deposited in the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission Revolving Fund. The interest 
shall cease to accrue when the total accrued interest equals the amount of the overpayment. If an overpayment is 
modified, the interest shall cease to accrue when the total accrued interest equals the amount of the modified 
overpayment. The Commission shall deduct the principal sum from any future benefits payable to the individual;” 
 
Per 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix XI (Compliance Supplement) Part 4 –Unemployment Insurance: UI Program 
Integrity (Part N5), “The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 (Pub. L. No. 113-67) amended Section 303 of the Social 
Security Act to require States to utilize the Treasury Offset Program (TOP), authorized by Section 6402(f)(4), 
Internal Revenue Code, to recover overpayments that remain uncollected one year after the debt was determined to 
be due.” 
 
Condition and Context:  During SFY 2018, the Agency failed to assess and collect penalties in the amount of 
$646,840 applicable to overpayments that were due to fraud.  Additionally, the Agency did not take timely action 
under section 6402(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to recover debt resulting from fraudulent overpayments 
determined to be uncollected after 1 year by participating in the Treasury Offset Program of the U.S. Department of 
Treasury during the full SFY 2018. 
 
Cause:  The Agency does not have adequate system in place to ensure compliance with 40 O.S. § 2-613 (1). 
Additionally, the Agency did not enter into an agreement to collect overpayments via the Treasury Offset Program 
until January 26, 2018 and the Agency’s procedures are not designed to maximize the collection of unemployment 
compensation debt that remained uncollected one year after the debt was determined to be due.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 

Effect: The Agency is not in compliance with the criteria above.  Additionally, overpayments are not properly 
recovered and the program may have lost funds by not participating in the Treasury Offset Program during the full 
SFY 2018.  

Recommendation: We recommend the Agency design its system to ensure compliance with 40 O.S. § 2-613 (1) to 
include the assessment of a 25% penalty applicable to fraud overpayments with 3/5 of the penalty amount collected 
being deposited into the Unemployment Trust Fund.

FINDING NO: 2018-060 
STATE AGENCY: Oklahoma Employment Security Commission 
FEDERAL AGENCY: U.S. Department of Labor 
CFDA NO: 17.225 
FEDERAL PROGRAM NAME: Unemployment Insurance 
FEDERAL AWARD NUMBER: UI-31619-18-60-A-40 and UI-31312-18-55-A-40 
FEDERAL AWARD YEAR: 2017 and 2018 
CONTROL CATEGORY: Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allowable Costs/Cost Principles 
QUESTIONED COSTS: $23,362 

Criteria: 2 CFR 200.405 (d) Allocable costs states, “Direct cost allocation principles. If a cost benefits two or more 
projects or activities in proportions that can be determined without undue effort or cost, the cost must be allocated to 
the projects based on the proportional benefit. If a cost benefits two or more projects or activities in proportions that 
cannot be determined because of the interrelationship of the work involved, then, …, the costs may be allocated or 
transferred to benefitted projects on any reasonable documented basis.” 

2 CFR §200.62, “Internal control over compliance requirements for Federal awards means a process implemented 
by a non-Federal entity designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following 
objectives for Federal awards: (a) Transactions are properly recorded and accounted  for, in  order to:  .  . . (3)  
Demonstrate compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award and 
(b) Transactions are executed in compliance with: (1) Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of 
the Federal award that could have a direct and material effect on a Federal program. . . .”

2 CFR 200.403 (a) Factors affecting allowability of costs states,  “Except  where  otherwise authorized by statute, 
costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under Federal awards:  
Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these 
principles.”  

2 CFR 200.431 (c) Compensation – fringe benefits states, . . . “Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards 
and all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) 
of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as 
direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.” 

A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   

Condition and Context: The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) informed agencies in February 
2018 that any excess Pathfinder contributions (account code 513300 in the Statewide Accounting System) that went 
to the OPERS defined benefit plan would not be allowed to be charged to Federal grants. The Federal government 
maintains that the amount used to fund the defined benefit plan is an overcharge to Federal programs. As a result, 
OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 2016) 

52

And Questioned Costs 
 
through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point would be 
required to repay on their own. 
 
When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for Oklahoma Employment Security Commission (OESC), we noted 
that a total of $23,362 of unallowable costs were charged to the Unemployment Insurance Program – CFDA 
#17.225 during SFY  2018. Of the $23,362 of unallowable costs charged to the Federal grant for state fiscal year 
2018, $8,534 was charged for the period 2/21/18 to 6/30/18.  
 
Cause: The Commission was unaware it was an unallowable cost until notified by OMES. Also, the Commission 
did not ensure that charges made to the UI program for unallowable costs was discontinued after 2/20/2018. 
 
Effect: Of the total $23,362 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to the Federal program, and required to 
be reimbursed to the Federal agency, the Commission is responsible for the amount of $8,534, and OMES is 
responsible for the amount of $14,828. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Commission develop and implement procedures to ensure Pathfinder excess 
contributions (account 513300) are not charged to Federal grants.

FEDERAL AWARD NUMBER: 1705OK5021; 1705OK0301; 1805OK5021; 1705OK5MAP; 1805OK5MAP  
FEDERAL AWARD YEAR: 2017 and 2018  
CONTROL CATEGORY: Activities Allowed or Unallowed; Allowable Costs/Cost Principles; Eligibility   
 
Criteria: 45 CFR §75.303 states, “The non-Federal entity must:(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control 
over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award 
in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal 
controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated Framework”, issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 10.03 
states, in part, “Transactions are promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in 
controlling operations and making decisions. This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or event 
from its initiation and authorization through its final classification in summary records. In addition, management 
designs control activities so that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded.” 
The GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 10.13 states, in part, “Segregation of duties 
helps prevent fraud, waste, and abuse in the internal control system. Management considers the need to separate 
control activities related to authority, custody, and accounting of operations to achieve adequate segregation of 
duties.” 
 

53



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
Adequate internal controls over access and accountability for resources include (1) limiting access to resources and 
records to authorized individuals and (2) assigning and maintaining accountability for the custody and use of 
resources. 
 
Adequate internal controls over separation of duties and supervision include separating key duties and 
responsibilities in authorizing, processing, recording, and reviewing official agency transactions. 
 
Condition and Context: The Independent Service Auditor’s Report on the Service Organization’s System (SOC-1) 
for the period of September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2017 indicated control issues related to the job scheduling and 
access to data and programs control objectives and related controls for the general computer controls. This condition 
only applies to a portion of state fiscal year 2018, July through August of 2017. 
 
Cause: The service organization did not ensure users were restricted only to either development or production 
access in the job scheduling, nor did they ensure active users had appropriate access or terminated users were 
eliminated from the access to data and programs.  
 
Effect: Access to both development and production, and inappropriate user access increases the risk of waste, loss, 
unauthorized use or misappropriation of state and federal funds.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Authority continue to follow-up with the service organization and ensure 
noted deficiencies are addressed and corrective actions noted in the SOC-1 report are implemented in a timely 
manner.

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
Additionally, a component objective of generally accepted accounting principles is to provide accurate and reliable 
information. 
 
Condition and Context:  The Authority delegates the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS) to 
determine eligibility for non-MAGI (modified adjusted gross income) recipients.  

 For four of the 72 (5.56%) non-MAGI recipients of Medical Assistance Program payments tested, a 
redetermination of Medicaid eligibility had not been performed within 12 months of the last eligibility 
determination or redetermination and benefits were not discontinued after the period of eligibility expired. 
However, only three of those recipients had claims paid during SFY 2018. The recipient was ineligible for 
a portion of state fiscal year 2018.  

 For four of the 72 (5.56%) non-MAGI recipients of Medical Assistance Program payments tested, the 
recipient passed away during our audit period; however, the recipient had claims paid with date of service 
after their date of death. Of those four recipients that passed away during our audit period, three were 
identified by the Authority for recoupment during their annual death file audit. We will not question the 
costs of those three recipients.   

 The universe included 181,023 non-MAGI recipients with medical expenditures totaling $2,223,304,873. 
Medical payments for recipients sampled totaled $1,169,275. Questioned costs include all payments for 
services provided to those four recipients within the time period for which they were ineligible during SFY 
2018.  Payments for medical expenditures to recipients with non-compliance noted in the sample totaled 
$61,790, of which $36,471 ($61,790 times the applicable Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) 
rate (59.94% for the exception claims in the first quarter of SFY 18/ 58.57% for the claims in the second, 
third, and fourth quarters) for each exception claim) is the federal questioned costs.  

 
Cause: The Authority did not exercise appropriate oversight over the eligibility determinations made by DHS to 
ensure adequate controls are in place to properly close ineligible cases. 
 
Effect: The Authority may be paying for services for which the recipient is not entitled.    
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Authority investigate the recipients identified and, if considered necessary, 
recoup any funds paid to providers for services for which the recipients were not entitled. We also recommend the 
Authority take steps to ensure proper oversight over DHS eligibility determinations in order to identify and timely 
close any ineligible cases.

(a) Be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these
principles, and (b) Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles or in the Federal award as to
types or amount of cost items.”

Condition and Context: Medical payments are either direct medical payments that are initiated by the provider or 
are indirectly related to medical claims and are not initiated by the provider, such as the cost of non-emergency 
transportation to appointments or capitation payments to primary care providers based on the number of enrolled 
members.   

 Based on a medical professional’s review of 57 direct medical claims initiated by the provider for Medical
Assistance Program recipients, one (1.75%) claim had a payment error. The claim billed more units than
shown on the supporting documents. For this claim, since the supporting documentation indicated the
services provided did not meet Medicaid policy/regulatory requirements and were not adequately supported
by medical records or other evidence indicating that the services were actually provided and/or necessary,
we will question the costs.

 The universe included 22,966,923 direct medical payments totaling $4,086,640,272. Payments for direct
medical expenditures in our sample totaled $37,191. Payments for direct medical expenditures with non-
compliance noted in our sample totaled $47, of which $28 ($47 times the applicable Federal Medical
Assistance Percentage (FMAP) rate 59.94% for the exception claim in the first quarter) is the federal
questioned costs.

 In addition, one (1) claim had documentation errors. The attending physician listed on the claim did not
match the physician noted in the medical records provided; however, both physicians are approved
contractors with OHCA. For this claim, since the supporting documentation indicated the services provided
did meet Medicaid policy/regulatory requirements and were adequately supported by medical records or
other evidence indicating that the services were actually provided and/or necessary, we will not question
the costs.

Cause: One (1) claim submitted by a provider was not appropriately supported by medical records, and one (1) 
claim had documentation submitted to the Authority which included documentation errors.  

Effect: The Authority may be paying for services that were not performed or were not medically necessary. 

Recommendation: We recommend the Authority investigate the items identified and, if considered necessary, 
recoup any funds paid to providers for services that were not supported by medical records.

 Based on a medical professional’s review of 71 direct medical claims initiated by the provider for 
Children’s Health Insurance Program recipients, three (4.23%) claims had payment errors. One (1) billed 
claim indicated the provider was unable to complete the procedure, while the other two (2) billed claims 
were upcoded. For these claims, since the supporting documentation indicated the services provided did not 
meet Medicaid policy/regulatory requirements and were not adequately supported by medical records or 
other evidence indicating that the services were actually provided and/or necessary, we will question the 
costs.  

 The universe included 2,370,445 direct medical payments totaling $316,265,268. Payments for direct 
medical expenditures in our sample totaled $26,463. Payments for direct medical expenditures with non-
compliance noted in the sample totaled $1,777, of which $1,670 ($1777 x the applicable Federal Medical

 In addition, three (3) claims had documentation errors. For two (2) of the claims, the attending physician

the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 10.06 
states, “Control activities can be implemented in either an automated or a manual manner. Automated control 

57



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
activities are either wholly or partially automated through the entity’s information technology. Automated control 
activities tend to be more reliable because they are less susceptible to human error and are typically more efficient. 
If the entity relies on information technology in its operations, management designs control activities so that the 
information technology continues to operate properly.” 
 
The GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 11.06 states in part, “Management designs 
appropriate types of control activities in the entity’s information system for coverage of information processing 
objectives for operational processes.” 
 
The GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 11.07 states, “Information system general 
controls (at the entity-wide, system, and application levels) are the policies and procedures that apply to all or a large 
segment of an entity’s information systems. General controls facilitate the proper operation of information systems 
by creating the environment for proper operation of application controls. General controls include security 
management, logical and physical access, configuration management, segregation of duties, and contingency 
planning.” 
 
The GAO Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 11.12 states, “Security management includes 
the information processes and control activities related to access rights in an entity’s information technology, 
including who has the ability to execute transactions. Security management includes access rights across various 
levels of data, operating system (system software), network, application, and physical layers. Management designs 
control activities over access to protect an entity from inappropriate access and unauthorized use of the system. 
These control activities support appropriate segregation of duties. By preventing unauthorized use of and changes to 
the system, data and program integrity are protected from malicious intent (e.g., someone breaking into the 
technology to commit fraud, vandalism, or terrorism) or error.” 
 
Condition and Context: OHCA’s Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) processes medical claims. 
The MMIS system has over 1,800 edits/audits and validation checks to prevent erroneous payments. The editing 
process in the MMIS system consists of general data field verifications, provider and recipient eligibility, 
verification against historical claims data, etc. After discussion with OHCA staff, we determined there was no 
evidence anyone was monitoring the MMIS edit changes. Certain OHCA employees had the ability to change, 
create and even deactivate MMIS edits/audits without the review or approval of another individual.   
 
Cause: There is a lack of segregation of duties over changes in edits checks in the MMIS system. 
 
Effect: Lack of segregation of duties over changes in edit checks increases the risk of waste, loss, unauthorized use 
or misappropriation of state and federal funds.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend OHCA implement internal controls to ensure segregation of duties over 
changes in edits/audits. These controls should include review and approval by someone other than the individual 
changing, creating, and deactivating the MMIS edits/audits, and proper monitoring of changes to edits/audits within 
the MMIS system.

45 CFR §75.303 states, “The non-Federal entity must:(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the 
Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in 
compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. These internal 
controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated Framework”, issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 12.02 
states, “Management documents in policies the internal control responsibilities of the organization.” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 12.03 
states, “Management documents in policies for each unit its responsibility for an operational process’s objectives 
and related risks, and control activity design, implementation, and operating effectiveness. Each unit, with guidance 
from management, determines the policies necessary to operate the process based on the objectives and related risks 
for the operational process. Each unit also documents policies in the appropriate level of detail to allow management 
to effectively monitor the control activity.” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 12.04 
states, “Those in key roles for the unit may further define policies through day-to-day procedures, depending on the 
rate of change in the operating environment and complexity of the operational process. Procedures may include the 
timing of when a control activity occurs and any follow-up corrective actions to be performed by competent 
personnel if deficiencies are identified. Management communicates to personnel the policies and procedures so that 
personnel can implement the control activities for their assigned responsibilities.” 
 
The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 12.05 
states, in part, “Management periodically reviews policies, procedures, and related control activities for continued 
relevance and effectiveness in achieving the entity’s objectives or addressing related risks. If there is a significant 
change in an entity’s process, management reviews this process in a timely manner after the change to determine 
that the control activities are designed and implemented appropriately. … Management considers these changes in 
its periodic review.” 
 
2 CFR 200.508 (d) states, “The auditee must provide the auditor with access to personnel, accounts, books, records, 
supporting documentation, and other information as needed for the auditor to perform the audit required by this 
part.” 

 
74 Oklahoma Statute (O.S.) § 215 provides our office with the authority to examine any documents necessary in 
order to complete our audits. 
 
Condition and Context:  The Authority has no written policies to ensure violations of Medicaid laws and 
regulations by providers are identified and referred to an office with authority to prosecute cases of provider fraud. 
The Legal Division of the Authority stated that they follow 42 CFR §455.12 to §455.23, and routine internal 
meetings are set up between the Legal Division and Program Integrity to discuss identified questionable providers 
based on Program Integrity’s preliminary findings. If the result of the discussion is to investigate or review further, 
regular internal meetings within Legal are utilized to further discuss and review the providers before an ultimate 
decision to refer the provider to the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) is made. However, the State Auditor and 
Inspector’s Office (SAI) was not allowed to access any documentation pertaining to the cases to determine the

And Questioned Costs 

agency took appropriate steps to investigate and, if appropriate, make a referral. We did obtain a listing of the 
providers referred to the MFCU and verified with the MFCU that they received the cases. 

Cause: The Authority’s Legal Division took over the process in which the Authority’s Program Integrity previously 
referred cases to the MFCU. At the time of the change, the procedures changed; however, the policy was not 
updated. The Authority’s Legal Division believes client/attorney confidentiality precludes them from allowing SAI 
access to the identified suspected cases.    

Effect: Without written policies and procedures, the Authority is at risk for inconsistently communicating policies 
and procedures to staff, including new hires, which could lead to instances of suspected fraud not being referred to 
the State MFCU. Without access to documentation of the Authority’s suspected cases of fraud, SAI was not able to 
determine the agency took appropriate steps to investigate and appropriately refer cases to the MFCU.  

Recommendation: We recommend the Authority develop written policies and procedures to ensure violations of 
Medicaid laws and regulations by providers are identified and referred to the appropriate office or authority. We also 
recommend the Authority comply with the requirements of the state and federal laws and regulations to allow SAI 
access to identified suspected cases in order to perform the applicable audit procedures.

Auditor Response: We were only given a listing of cases referred to the MFCU. No other documentation to support 
the steps taken between flagging a case of possible fraud and determining which cases should be referred to the 
MFCU was provided to enable us to determine whether or not they complied with the requirement.  In our opinion, 
the Authority’s refusal to provide the necessary documentation for the MFCU case referrals is in direct violation of 
laws and regulations stated in the criteria above, as well as the Supreme Court’s Opinion in 1980 OK 28, 
which was also provided to the Authority by our Legal Counsel during the audit.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   
 
Condition and Context:  The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) informed agencies in 
February 2018 that any excess Pathfinder contributions (account code 513300 in the Statewide Accounting System) 
that went to the OPERS defined benefit plan would not be allowed to be charged to Federal grants. The Federal 
government maintains that the amount used to fund the defined benefit plan is an overcharge to Federal programs. 
As a result, OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 
2016) through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point 
would be required to repay on their own.  
 
When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for the Authority we noted $128,048 in Pathfinder contributions 
charged to the referenced Federal grants during SFY 2018. Of the $128,048 of unallowable costs charged to Federal 
grants for state fiscal year 2018, $43,948 was charged from 2/20/18 to 6/30/18.  
 
Cause: The Authority was unaware it was an unallowable charge until notified by OMES. Also, the Authority did 
not ensure that charges made to the Federal programs for unallowable costs was discontinued after 2/20/2018.  
 
Effect: Of the total $128,048 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to the Federal programs, and required 
to be reimbursed to the Federal agency, the Authority is responsible for the amount of $43,948, and OMES is 
responsible for the amount of $84,100. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Authority develop and implement procedures to ensure Pathfinder excess 
contributions (account 513300) are not charged to Federal grants.

Per 2 CFR §200.510 (b), “Schedule of expenditures of Federal awards. The auditee must also prepare a schedule of 
expenditures of Federal awards for the period covered by the auditee's financial statements which must include the 
total Federal awards expended as determined in accordance with §200.502 …. At a minimum, the schedule must: (3)

For Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Cluster and the HIV Care Formula Grant:  
 
Per 45 CFR §75.303(a), the non-Federal entity must: “Establish and maintain effective internal control over the 
Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in 
compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and terms and conditions of the Federal award…”

Per 45 CFR §75.502 (a), “Determining Federal awards expended. The determination of when a Federal award is 
expended must be based on when the activity related to the Federal award occurs….”  
 
Condition and Context:  The original FY 2018 Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA – GAAP 
Package Z) submitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Health to the Office of Management and Enterprise 
Services (OMES) incorrectly reported the following amounts:  
 

 understated the beginning federal cash balance for CFDA #10.557 by $847,137;  
 overstated the cash basis federal revenue for CFDA #93.505 by $118,372;  
 overstated the cash basis federal revenue for CFDA #93.870 by $6,095,058; 
 understated the cash basis federal expenditure for CFDA #93.870 by $898,423;  
 understated the cash basis federal expenditures for CFDA #93.917 by $260,140; 
 overstated the amount transferred to state agencies for CFDA #93.917 by $260,140; 
 understated the amount provided to non-state agency subrecipients for CFDA #93.917 by $260,140; 
 overstated the amount prior year Federal accounts payable by $1,350,789; 

 
Cause: The review process for the SEFA’s did not detect these errors. 
 
Effect: By incorrectly reporting the amounts in the SEFA, the Federal awarding agency is unable to determine 
Federal expenditures for the cluster or the programs identified.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend OMES amend the SFY 2018 SEFA’s to reflect the correct amounts for CFDA 
#10.557, #93.505, #93.870 and #93.917. Further, we recommend the Oklahoma State Department of Health review 
the current procedures and implement the necessary procedures to ensure accurate reporting of program financial 
information on the SEFA’s (GAAP Package Z).

A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   
 
Condition and Context:  We noted that the amounts reported on line 12 – Remarks – on the SF 425 for prior year 
rebate funds and rebate funds expended did not agree to supporting documentation. Furthermore, OSDH did not 
identify the correct Federal award on the submitted report. 
 
Cause: It appears that OSDH does not have adequate processes in place to ensure that the FFR is being reviewed

Criteria: 45 CFR 75.302 Financial management and standards for financial management systems. (a) states, 
“Each state must expend and account for the Federal award in accordance with state laws and procedures for 
expending and accounting for the state's own funds. In addition, the state's and the other non-Federal entity's 
financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and 
the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by 
general and program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures adequate to 
establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award.” 
 
45 CFR 75.302 (b)(4) states, “Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. 
The non-Federal entity must adequately safeguard all assets and assure that they are used solely for authorized 
purposes.” 
 
Condition and Context:  The Department did not maintain separate accounting/fund for the HIV Care Grant (Ryan 
White program) rebates in the Statewide Accounting System. The rebate funds were comingled with other federal 
funds in Class Fund 400; therefore, OSDH is unable to support that Ryan White program rebate funds were used in 
accordance with Federal regulations and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.  
 
Cause: During the implementation of the Statewide Accounting System, no process/class fund was put in place to 
account for Ryan White program funds independently of other Federal funds. 
 
Effect: Restricted Ryan White rebate funds could be used for purposes unrelated to the Ryan White program. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Department establish a separate restricted fund in the Statewide Accounting 
System for Ryan White program rebates in order to ensure compliance with Federal regulations.

Per 45 CFR Part 75, Appendix XI (Compliance Supplement) Part 3.2 – Subrecipient Monitoring, A pass-through 
entity (PTE) must: 
 Identify the Award and Applicable Requirements – Clearly identify to the subrecipient: (1) the award as a 

subaward at the time of subaward (or subsequent subaward modification) by providing the information 
described in 45 CFR section 75.352(a)(1); (2) all requirements imposed by the PTE on the subrecipient so that 
the Federal award is used in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the 
award; and (3) any additional requirements that the PTE imposes on the subrecipient in order for the PTE to 
meet its own responsibility for the Federal award (e.g., financial, performance, and special reports).  

 
 Monitor – Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for 

authorized purposes, complies with the terms and conditions of the subaward, and achieves performance goals 
(45 CFR sections 75.352(d) through (f)). In addition to procedures identified as necessary based upon the 
evaluation of subrecipient risk or specifically required by the terms and conditions of the award, subaward 
monitoring must include the following:  
1. Reviewing financial and programmatic (performance and special reports) required by the PTE.  
2. Following-up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies 

pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the PTE detected through audits, on-site 
reviews, and other means.  

3. Issuing a management decision for audit findings pertaining to the Federal award provided to the 
subrecipient from the PTE as required by 45 CFR section 75.521.  

 
Condition and Context:  For ten out of ten (100%) subrecipients tested, OSDH did not include the Federal Award 
Identifying Number (FAIN) in the initial subaward documents.  
 

65



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
For three of ten (30%) subrecipients tested, we were unable to determine that OSDH performed the required 
subrecipient monitoring due to lack of supporting documentation.  
 
Cause: OSDH’s control process does not ensure required information is included in the initial subaward documents.  
OSDH did not perform or did not maintain adequate documentation to ensure subrecipients were monitored as 
required.  
 
Effect: Without monitoring and identification of required award information, subrecipients may not be aware of 
the requirements of the program and may not use the subaward for authorized purposes, comply with the terms and 
conditions of the subaward, and achieve performance goals (45 CFR sections 75.352(d) through (f)).  
 
Recommendation: We recommend OSDH modify its current processes to ensure required documentation is 
provided to subrecipients, subrecipients are monitored, and adequate documentation is maintained related to its 
identification of subawards and subrecipient monitoring activities.

implemented by a non-Federal entity designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the 
following objectives for Federal awards: (a) Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for, in order to: . . . 
(3) Demonstrate compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award 
and (b) Transactions are executed in compliance with: (1) Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award that could have a direct and material effect on a Federal program. . . .” 

2 CFR 200.403 (a) Factors affecting allowability of costs states, “Except where otherwise authorized by statute, 
costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under Federal awards: Be necessary and 
reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.”  

2 CFR 200.431 (c) Compensation – fringe benefits states, “Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards and 
all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of 
employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as 
direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.” 
 
A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   
 
Condition and Context: The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) informed agencies in February 
2018 that any excess Pathfinder contributions (account code 513300 in the Statewide Accounting System) that went 
to the OPERS defined benefit plan would not be allowed to be charged to Federal grants. The Federal government 
maintains that the amount used to fund the defined benefit plan is an overcharge to Federal programs. As a result, 
OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 2016) 
through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point would be 
required to repay on their own.  
 
When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for OSDH we noted $75,365 in Pathfinder contributions charged to the 
Federal grants during SFY 2018. Of the $75,365 of unallowable costs charged to Federal grants for state fiscal year 
2018, $16,813 was charged from 2/21/18 to 6/30/18. 
 
Cause: The Department was unaware it was an unallowable charge until notified by OMES. Also, the Department 
did not ensure that charges made to the Federal programs for unallowable costs was discontinued after 2/20/2018.   
 
Effect:  Of the total $75,365 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to the Federal grants, and required to be 
reimbursed to the Federal Agency, the Department is responsible for the amount of $16,813, and OMES is 
responsible for the amount of $58,552.

Auditor Response: The amounts in question after the 2/20/18 notification from OMES were included in the amount 
reported on the OSDH SEFA; therefore, we determined that OSDH considered those costs an expenditure of the 
program.

QUESTIONED COSTS:  $0 

Criteria: 2 CFR §200.303(a) states in part, “The non-Federal entity must: Establish and maintain effective internal 
control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the 
Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award. 
These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in “Standards for Internal Control in the Federal 
Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the United States or the “Internal Control Integrated 
Framework”, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).” 

Per 2 CFR Part 200, Appendix XI (Compliance Supplement) Part 3 – Subrecipient Monitoring, A pass-through 
entity (PTE) must: 
 Identify the Award and Applicable Requirements – Clearly identify to the subrecipient: (1) the award as a

subaward at the time of subaward (or subsequent subaward modification) by providing the information
described in 2 CFR section 200.331(a)(1); (2) all requirements imposed by the PTE on the subrecipient so that
the Federal award is used in accordance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the
award (2 CFR section 200.331(a)(2)); and (3) any additional requirements that the PTE imposes on the
subrecipient in order for the PTE to meet its own responsibility for the Federal award (e.g., financial,
performance, and special reports) (2 CFR section 200.331(a)(3)).

 Evaluate Risk – Evaluate each subrecipient’s risk of noncompliance for purposes of determining the appropriate
subrecipient monitoring related to the subaward (2 CFR section 200.331(b)). This evaluation of risk may
include consideration of such factors as the following:
1. The subrecipient’s prior experience with the same or similar subawards;
2. The results of previous audits including whether or not the subrecipient receives single audit in accordance

with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, and the extent to which the same or similar subaward has been audited as a
major program;

3. Whether the subrecipient has new personnel or new or substantially changed systems; and
4. The extent and results of Federal awarding agency monitoring (e.g., if the subrecipient also receives

Federal awards directly from a Federal awarding agency).

• Monitor – Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for 
authorized purposes, complies with the terms and conditions of the subaward, and achieves performance goals 
(2 CFR sections 200.331(d) through (f)). In addition to procedures identified as necessary based upon the 
evaluation of subrecipient risk or specifically required by the terms and conditions of the award, subaward 
monitoring must include the following:
1.    Reviewing financial and programmatic (performance and special reports) required by the PTE.
2.    Following-up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies
       pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the PTE detected through audits, on-site
       reviews, and other means.
3.    Issuing a management decision for audit findings pertaining to the Federal award provided to the
       subrecipient from the PTE as required by 2 CFR section 200.521.

Condition and Context:  Based on review of four of nine Foster Care subrecipient contracts during the SFY 2017 
audit, we noted OKDHS did not indicate the CFDA title and number, award name and number, award date, amount 
of the award, contact information for the pass-through entity, if the award is research and development, the name of 
the Federal Awarding Agency, terms and conditions concerning closeout of subaward, or applicable compliance 
requirements. Based on discussion with Foster Care Management, it appears a revision to the contract to address the 
condition noted in the SFY 2017 audit was not made until after SFY 2018.   

Also, through discussion with Foster Care management during the SFY 2017 audit, we noted there is no review 
performed by OKDHS of Foster Care expenditures incurred by each of its subrecipients nor does OKDHS contact 
its subrecipients to ensure they are administering the award in accordance with the grant requirements. Further, 
based on review of OIG’s database of subrecipients, it appears only two of the nine appear in the database. 
Therefore, OKDHS does not obtain and review all the single audits of the Foster Care subrecipients as required. 
Based on discussion with Foster Care Management, it appears corrective action to address the condition noted in the 
SFY 2017 audit was not made until after SFY 2018.   

Cause: Management did not take corrective action to address subrecipient monitoring requirements conditions noted 
during the SFY 2017audit until after SFY 2018. 

Effect: OKDHS is not in compliance with the criteria above. Additionally, the subrecipient may not be spending 
federal funds in accordance with program requirements. 

Recommendation: We recommend OKDHS immediately implement policies and procedures that would ensure 
compliance with 2 CFR 200.331. This would include: 

 (1) informing subrecipients (current and future) of all necessary information as required by 2 CFR 200.331(a)
 (2) evaluating each subrecipient’s risk of material noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and terms

and conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining appropriate subrecipient monitoring as required by
2 CFR 200.331(b)

 (3) monitoring the activities of the subrecipient by (a) reviewing financial and programmatic reports, (b)
following up and ensuring subrecipients take timely and appropriate action on deficiencies noted through
agency audits, on-site reviews, and other means, (c) issuing management decisions for audit findings as required
by 2 CFR 200.331, and (d) establishing policies and procedures to ensure OKDHS receives and reviews a single
audit or program specific audit from those subrecipients who expend $750,000 or more in Federal awards as
required by 2 CFR 200.501

FEDERAL PROGRAM NAME:  TANF Cluster 
FEDERAL AWARD NUMBER:  1701OKTANF 
FEDERAL AWARD YEAR:  2017  
CONTROL CATEGORY:  Activities Allowed/Unallowed, Allowable Costs/Cost Principles, and Eligibility 
QUESTIONED COSTS:  $10,000,000 
 
Criteria:  Title 45 §260.20 states, “The TANF program has the following four purposes: (a) Provide assistance to 
needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives….” 
 
Per Title 45 §260.31(a)(1), “The term “assistance” includes cash, payments, vouchers, and other forms of benefits 
designed to meet a family's ongoing basic needs (i.e., for food, clothing, shelter, utilities, household goods, personal 
care items, and general incidental expenses).” 
 
The TANF Program Policy Questions and Answers addressing the Use of TANF Funds found on the Administration 
for Children and Families website (https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/resource/q-a-use-of-funds) state, “Q6: May a State 
use Federal TANF or State MOE funds for adoption assistance? A6: A State could use Federal TANF or State MOE 
funds to provide adoption benefits and services4 to needy parents of an adopted child who is not eligible for title IV-
E adoption assistance.5 The adoption establishes a parental relationship even if no blood relationship exists.” 

_________________________________________________ 
4
Benefits provided in this circumstance would trigger applicable TANF rules if they meet the definition of "assistance," e.g., address basic needs, and are provided 

under the TANF program. 
5
States may not use Federal or State MOE funds to take the place of any adoption assistance payments provided under the Federal Adoption Assistance Program; 

section 402 of the Act requires "eligible States" (i.e., States that receive Federal TANF funds) to certify that the State will operate a Foster Care and Adoption 

Assistance Program under Title IV-E of the Act. However, there may be circumstances under which adoption assistance (in the form of family services, benefits 

payments, or both) would be outside the normal purview of the IV-E program and reasonably calculated to accomplish TANF purpose one. Expenditures on adoption 

assistance in such circumstances could constitute an allowable use of Federal or State MOE funds. 
 

Condition and Context:  While performing analysis on the Statewide SEFA, we discovered that a portion of the 
federal TANF grant was being used to pay non-IV-E Adoption Assistance subsidies.  Since the agency considers 
these Adoption Assistance subsidies to be TANF assistance, it appears they fall under TANF purpose one which 
allows for TANF funding to be utilized to provide assistance to needy families.  Based on discussion with agency 
personnel, it appears all expenditures recorded to account code 34X-2110 were considered TANF compensable as 
‘child only cases’; however, annual TANF eligibility determinations, including analysis of income, were not 
performed in order to ensure the benefits were paid to needy families.  
 
Additionally, there is no detailed benefit data by case to determine exactly which cases these TANF funds were 
applied to because the Budget Unit makes the determination on the amount of TANF to be utilized annually for this 
purpose based on the agency’s fiscal need.  Because of this, we question the allowability of the entire $10,000,000 
of TANF funds utilized for this purpose during SFY18. 
 
Based on analysis of the FFY16 and FFY17 TANF ACF-196 reports, it appears that line 6b includes these types of 
Adoption Assistance subsidy payments.  Approximately 21% of the total FFY16 TANF grant expenditures and 
16.38% of the FFY17 (through 6/30/18 filings) TANF grant expenditures were attributed to this particular line.  This 
compares to 4.08% of the total FFY15 TANF grant expenditures. 
 
Cause: Per discussion with agency personnel, we noted that a decision was made in 2011 to utilize TANF funds to 
pay for non-IV-E Adoption Assistance subsidies under the assumption that these subsidies were TANF compensable 
due to them being ‘child only cases’.  From 2011 forward, TANF funds were utilized for this purpose and were 
considered TANF assistance.  At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Budget Unit decides the amount of TANF 
funds to use for non-IV-E Adoption Assistance subsidy payments.  The amount that the Budget Unit determines is 
then divided by twelve and that calculated amount is drawn from the TANF grant each month of the fiscal year.  
There is no detailed assistance benefit data by case that supports the monthly draw amount; the amount is solely 
determined by the Budget Unit dependent on the fiscal need of the agency.

Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 
During FFY16 and FFY17, the agency chose to allocate significantly more TANF funds to non-IV-E Adoption 
Assistance than had been allocated in previous years.  This was because costs of adoption grew, and State funding 
sources decreased due to the downturn in the state’s economy.  There were overall state budget reductions across all 
of state government. During this time, DHS exhausted TANF carryover funding to compensate for reduced state 
funding. It appears that state funding previously used to fund non-IV-E Adoption Assistance subsidies was 
supplanted with federal TANF funding. 
 
Effect: Since the agency has determined these non-IV-E Adoption Assistance subsidy payments are considered 
TANF assistance, it appears that TANF assistance is being provided to families that may not be needy since there 
are no need-based eligibility determinations performed on a routine basis for this group of TANF recipients. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend that agency personnel implement procedures to perform TANF eligibility 
determinations when using TANF funds to pay non-IV-E Adoption Assistance benefits.  These eligibility 
determinations should include an analysis of income to ensure the family meets the income requirement to be 
considered a family in need and qualify for TANF assistance.

QUESTIONED COSTS:  $0 
 
Criteria: The Government Accountability Office (GAO) Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government 
10.10 states, “Transaction control activities are actions built directly into operational processes to support the entity 
in achieving its objectives and addressing related risks. “Transactions” tends to be associated with financial 
processes (e.g., payables transactions), while “activities” is more generally applied to operational or compliance 
processes. For the purposes of this standard, “transactions” covers both definitions. Management may design a 
variety of transaction control activities for operational processes, which may include verifications, reconciliations, 
authorizations and approvals, physical control activities, and supervisory control activities. 
 
According to OKDHS’ Electronic Payments Handbook, “The cards are to be inventoried at the time of receipt and 
kept locked in the County Director’s office, or another secure office location, where access is restricted to 
designated staff.” … “At the end of each day, the unused cards will be returned to inventory, signed in by the EBT 
Specialist, and initialed by the County Director or designee.” 
 
Best practice includes the security of EBT cards, which includes the security of the cards themselves as well as the 
security of the keys to the cards, the daily reconciliation of EBT cards, and the deactivation of an EBT card prior to 
destruction. 
 
Condition and Context:   
Based on procedures performed at eight of the 77 county office locations, we noted: 
 

 Three (37.5%) offices did not keep keys to the (Electronic Benefit Transaction) EBT card inventory 
secured;   

71



Schedule of Findings 
And Questioned Costs 
 

 Seven (87.5%) offices did not maintain the EBT cards in a secure office location where access is restricted 
to designated staff; 

 One (12.5%) office was unable to provide documentation supporting EBT cards ordered; 
 Eight (100%) offices’ inventory logs did not support that the inventory count was performed by two 

individuals at the end of each day; 
 Six (75%) offices do not verify the card status to ensure card deactivation prior to destruction; 
 Two (25%) county offices did not ensure the card destruction process was performed by two employees.  

 
Based on review of EBT Card destruction logs from the remaining 69 county offices we noted 5 county offices 
(7.25%) did not have dual signatures indicating a witness of EBT card destructions performed in SFY 2018.  
Furthermore, based on walk-through performed at one judgmentally selected county office, we noted that the 
office staff did not verify EBT card status to ensure card deactivation prior to destruction.  

 
Cause: OKDHS policies and procedures related to the inventory accounting and securing of EBT cards are not 
consistently followed.  
 
Effect: EBT cards are at risk of unauthorized issuance and improper use due to lack of insufficient inventory 
procedures leading to potential misuse or misappropriation of Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) 
benefits.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend DHS ensure policies and procedures related to proper inventory accounting and 
securing of EBT cards are consistently followed. Additionally, we recommend DHS management implement 
procedures to monitor the county office locations for compliance with these policies and procedures throughout the 
year.

OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 2016) 
through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point would be 
required to repay on their own. 
 
When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS), we noted that 
a total of $239,550 of unallowable costs were charged to the Foster Care (FC) program – CFDA # 93.568 during 
SFY  2018. Of the $239,550 of unallowable costs charged to the Federal grant for state fiscal year 2018, $89,951 
was charged for the period 2/21/18 to 6/30/18.  
 
Cause: The Department was unaware it was an unallowable charge until notified by OMES.  Also, the Agency did 
not ensure that charges made to the FC program for unallowable costs was discontinued after 2/20/2018. 
 
Effect: Of the total $239,550 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to the Federal program, and required to 
be reimbursed to the Federal agency, the Agency is responsible for the amount of $89,951, and OMES is responsible 
for the amount of $149,599. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Agency develop and implement procedures to ensure Pathfinder excess 
contributions (account 513300) are not charged to Federal grants.

45 CFR 75.403 (a) Factors affecting allowability of costs states, “Except where otherwise authorized by statute, 
costs must meet the following general criteria in order to be allowable under Federal awards: Be necessary and 
reasonable for the performance of the Federal award and be allocable thereto under these principles.”  
 
45 CFR 75.431 (c) Compensation – fringe benefits states, “Such benefits, must be allocated to Federal awards and 
all other activities in a manner consistent with the pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) of 
employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such Federal awards and other activities, and charged as 
direct or indirect costs in accordance with the non-Federal entity's accounting practices.” 
 
A basic objective of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles is to provide accurate, reliable, and timely 
information.   
 
Condition and Context: The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) informed agencies in February 
2018 that any excess Pathfinder contributions (account code 513300 in the Statewide Accounting System) that went 
to the OPERS defined benefit plan would not be allowed to be charged to Federal grants. The Federal government 
maintains that the amount used to fund the defined benefit plan is an overcharge to Federal programs. As a result, 
OMES informed the agencies they would repay the unallowable costs from inception (state fiscal year 2016) 
through 2/20/18.  However, any agencies charging Federal grants for the unallowable cost after that point would be 
required to repay on their own. 
 
When reviewing the excess Pathfinder costs for the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (DHS), we noted that 
a total of $115,743 of unallowable costs were charged to the Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid) – CFDA # 
93.778 during SFY  2018. Of the $115,743 of unallowable costs charged to the Federal grant for state fiscal year 
2018, $44,925 was charged for the period 2/21/18 to 6/30/18.  
 
Cause: The Department was unaware it was an unallowable charge until notified by OMES. Also, the Agency did 
not ensure that charges made to the Medicaid program for unallowable costs was discontinued after 2/20/2018. 
 
Effect: Of the total $115,743 in excess Pathfinder contributions overcharged to the Federal program, and required to 
be reimbursed to the Federal agency, the Agency is responsible for the amount of $44,925, and OMES is responsible 
for the amount of $70,818. 
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Agency develop and implement procedures to ensure Pathfinder excess 
contributions (account 513300) are not charged to Federal grants.

Criteria:  2 CFR §200.303 - Internal controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must: (a) Establish and 
maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal 
entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award.”  

2 CFR §200.62 - Internal control over compliance requirements for Federal awards states in part, “Internal control 
over compliance requirements for Federal awards means a process implemented by a non-Federal entity designed to 
provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of the following objectives for Federal awards: (a) 
Transactions are properly recorded and accounted for, in order to:  (1) Permit the preparation of reliable financial 
statements and Federal reports;  (2) Maintain accountability over assets; and (3) Demonstrate compliance with 
Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award;”  

OAC 730:10-5-2(3) states in part, “no federal-aid project shall be advertised for contract letting until all federal and 
state requirements have been satisfied…. The city must deposit its share of the local matching funds with the 
Department prior to advertising for bids on the project. (A) The project will be officially programmed by the 
Commission, subject to availability of federal funds, only when all of the conditions in this section have been met 
and the project is ready to be advertised for contract letting.” 
 
OAC 730:10-1-7 (a) states, “all city or county funds which, by agreement with the Department are to be used to pay 
or participate in construction contract cost items shall be deposited with the Department prior to advertising the 
project for bids. If the city or county by agreement with the Department is to perform a portion or all of the 
construction work as their share of the project costs, they will not be required to deposit funds with the Department 
prior to advertising for bids. Where it is impossible to determine final cost of the project until construction is 
completed, the deposit shall be based on the engineer's quantity estimates.” 
 
Condition and Context:  We determined that 3 of 42 (7.14%) projects listed as having insufficient funds/no deposit 
in the monthly exception memos to the office engineer during the audit period were awarded prior to deposit of the 
local matching funds and did not appear to meet the exception noted in OAC 730:10-1-7 for work performed by the 
City or County.  However, the Department did not issue a notice to proceed for the project until the funds were on 
deposit from the third party. 
 
Cause:  The Oklahoma Department of Transportation personnel in charge of preventing projects from being sent to 
bid without having funds on deposit was unaware of the OAC requirement.    
 
Effect: Failure to ensure that the required funds are on deposit with the Department may cause a delay in the 
awarding of a project or delay a notice to proceed for the project to begin.   
 
Recommendation:  We recommend the Oklahoma Department of Transportation evaluate the review processes for 
third party funding and make the appropriate adjustments

Criteria: 2 CFR §200.303 - Internal controls states in part, “The Non-Federal entity must: (a) Establish and 
maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides reasonable assurance that the non-Federal 
entity is managing the Federal award in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of the Federal award.”  
 
2 CFR §200.331 - Requirements for pass-through entities states in part, “All pass-through entities must:  

(a) Ensure that every subaward is clearly identified to the subrecipient as a subaward and includes the following 
information at the time of the subaward and if any of these data elements change, include the changes in 
subsequent subaward modification. When some of this information is not available, the pass-through entity 
must provide the best information available to describe the Federal award and subaward. Required 
information includes:  
(1) Federal Award Identification.  

xi. CFDA Number and Name; the pass-through entity must identify the dollar amount made available 
under each Federal award and the CFDA number at time of disbursement; 
 

(b)  Evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring described 
in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section…. 
 

(d)  Monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized 
purposes, in compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward; 
and that subaward performance goals are achieved. Pass-through entity monitoring of the subrecipient must 
include: 
(1) Reviewing financial and performance reports required by the pass-through entity. 
(2) Following-up and ensuring that the subrecipient takes timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies 

pertaining to the Federal award provided to the subrecipient from the pass-through entity detected 
through audits, on-site reviews, and other means. 

(3) Issuing a management decision for audit findings pertaining to the Federal award provided to the 
subrecipient from the pass-through entity as required by §200.521 Management decision. 

 
(f)  Verify that every subrecipient is audited as required by Subpart F—Audit Requirements of this part when it 

is expected that the subrecipient's Federal awards expended during the respective fiscal year equaled or 
exceeded the threshold set forth in §200.501 Audit requirements.” 

 
Condition and Context:  While performing procedures to document the processes utilized for identifying the 
subaward, it was determined that no processes were in place to identify the CFDA number to subrecipients of 
Emergency Repair, Enhancement, and Safe Routes to Schools funding. We noted that 15 of 25 (60%) award 
documents tested from all subrecipient types did not contain a CFDA number. 
 
While performing procedures to document the processes utilized to evaluate the risk of noncompliance, it was 
determined that no processes were in place to formally evaluate the risk of noncompliance for Municipal Planning 
Organizations and Regional Transportation Planning Organizations. 
 
While performing procedures to document the processes utilized for monitoring the activities of the subrecipient, it 
was determined that no processes were in place to determine whether recipients of Emergency Repair, 
Enhancement, and Safe Routes to Schools funding have expended over $750,000 and require a single audit. In 
addition, for 6 of 6 (100%) Municipal Planning Organization and Regional Transportation Planning Organization 
subrecipients expending more than $750,000, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation received a copy of the 
required single audit; however, for 4 of 6 (66.7%) the 2017 audits were not reviewed for deficiencies and 
appropriate corrective actions.  
 
Cause: The Oklahoma Department of Transportation has not designed and implemented internal controls to ensure 
that all subrecipient contracts or award documentation include a CFDA number, that all risk assessments were 
performed on Municipal Planning Organization and Regional Transportation Planning Organization subrecipients, 
and that all required Single Audits are received, reviewed, and timely follow-up on findings is performed.

And Questioned Costs 
 
Effect: Without a process to ensure subrecipients are effectively monitored, subrecipients and the Oklahoma 
Department of Transportation are at risk of being out of compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms 
and conditions for the Federal award.  
 
Recommendation: We recommend the Oklahoma Department of Transportation review the current subrecipient 
processes and implement the necessary processes to ensure all subrecipients are monitored in accordance with the 
Grants Management requirements.  Recommendations include:  

- Updating information in subrecipient contract templates to include CFDA number. 
- Develop risk assessment procedures related to subrecipients to ensure adequate monitoring of the 

subrecipient is occurring. 
- Develop procedures to review required Single Audits and follow-up on findings noted in the required audit.

Notes to the Schedule of Expenditures

NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF 
FEDERAL AWARDS 

For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 
 
Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (schedule) includes the federal award 
activity of the State of Oklahoma for the year ended June 30, 2018. The information in this schedule is 
presented in conformity with the requirements set forth in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). 

 
A.  Reporting Entity 
 
The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has set forth criteria to be considered in 
determining financial accountability. The reporting entity includes the primary government of the State of 
Oklahoma as presented in the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR). Component units included 
in the CAFR prepare individual financial statements that meet the requirements of Uniform Guidance, and 
have not been included in the schedule. Uniform Guidance allows non-Federal entities to meet the audit 
requirements of the compliance supplement through a series of audits that cover the reporting entity.  
 
B. Basis of Presentation 
 
The schedule presents expenditures and expenses for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The schedule 
reports total federal award expenditures and expenses for each federal program as identified in the Catalog 
of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). Federal awards without identified CFDA numbers have been 
identified as “Unknown” (UNK). 
 
Federal financial awards include federal financial assistance and federal cost-reimbursement contracts. 
Federal financial assistance may be defined as assistance provided by a federal agency, either directly or 
indirectly, in the form of grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, loans, loan guarantees, property, food 
commodities, interest subsidies, insurance or direct appropriations, but does not include direct federal cash 
assistance to individuals. Non-monetary federal assistance including surplus property, food stamps and 
food commodities is reported in the schedule. Solicited contracts between the state and the federal 
government for which the federal government procures tangible goods or services are not considered to be 
federal financial assistance. 
 
Food and commodity distributions on the accompanying schedule are valued using a weighted average cost 
based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture commodity price list at the inventory receipt date. The food 
stamp issuance amount included in the accompanying schedule is stated at the value of food stamps 
redeemed. Donated federal surplus property is included in the schedule at a percentage of the federal 
government acquisition cost. 
 
The scope of the schedule includes expenditures made by state primary recipients. The determination of 
when a federal award is expended is based on when the activity related to the federal award occurs. 
Generally, the activity pertains to events that require the state agency to comply with federal statutes, 
regulations, and the terms and conditions of federal awards. With reference to the primary government, the 
primary recipient expenditures are not adjusted for sub-recipient expenditures.  
 

93



Notes to the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards 
 

 

Certain federal expenditure transactions may appear in the records of more than one state agency.  To avoid 
duplication and overstatement of the aggregate level of federal expenditures by the State of Oklahoma, the 
following policies have been adopted:  
 

 When monies are received by one state agency and distributed to another state agency, the federal 
expenditures are attributed to the state agency that actually expends the funds. 

 
 When purchases of provider services between two state agencies occurs, the federal funds are 

normally recorded as expenditures on the purchasing state agency’s records and provider service 
revenues on the records of the state agency rendering the services.  Therefore, the receipt of 
federal funds related to provider services will be attributed to the purchasing agency which is the 
primary receiving/expending state agency.  

 
Major programs are defined by levels of expenditures and expenses and risk assessments established in the 
Uniform Guidance. 
 
C. Basis of Accounting 
 
The accompanying schedule, in general, reports expenditures of the primary government in accordance 
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP requires that governmental funds report 
revenue and expenditures using the modified accrual basis of accounting as described in the 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The modified accrual basis of accounting recognizes 
expenditures and expenses when liquidated with current resources. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife 
Conservation uses the accrual basis of accounting that recognizes expenditures when incurred. 

 
Note 2.  State Unemployment Insurance Fund 
 
Expenditures for unemployment insurance (CFDA#17.225) include state unemployment insurance (UI) 
funds as well as federal UI funds. The state portion of UI funds amounted to $224,889,702. The federal 
portion of UI funds amounted to $37,965,215. 
 
Note 3.  Cost Recovery of Federal Program Expenditures 
 
During fiscal year 2018, the Oklahoma Department of Health received cash rebates from infant formula 
manufacturers in the amount of $19,856,883 on sales of formula to participants in the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (CFDA#10.557). The rebate contracts are authorized 
by 7 CFR 246.16(a) as a cost containment measure. The cash rebates are treated as a credit against prior 
food expenditures. 
 
The Oklahoma Department of Transportation has incurred significant expenditures on construction projects 
that have exceeded the contract amounts approved by the federal grantor. These project expenditures are 
held in suspense until modified contracts are approved by the federal grantor and the expenditures 
subsequently reimbursed. Project expenditures totaling $233,000 were in suspense at June 30, 2018, and 
once the modified contracts are approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation an estimated 100% will 
be considered available. 
 
Note 4.  Indirect Cost Rate 
 

Per Uniform Guidance 2 CFR § 200.510(b)(6), agencies are required to disclose whether or not they elect 
to use the 10 percent de minimis cost rate that 2 CFR§ 200.414(f) allows for nonfederal entities that have 
never received a negotiated indirect cost rate. Below is a table indicating whether the agency has elected to 
use the 10 percent de minimis cost rate or not:

Note 5.  Audits Provided by Auditors Other Than Principal Auditor 
 
Audits provided by auditors other than the principal auditor include: 
 
 Oklahoma Department of Commerce 
 Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation 
  
Several programs were identified as major and audited as such in the separate single audits of these entities. 
The schedule separately identifies programs that were audited as major programs by independent auditors 
of entities. 
 
Note 6.  Department of Transportation Federal Soft Match Provision 
 
Beginning in the year 1992, the Oklahoma Department of Transportation began using the “soft match” 
provision of the Inter-modal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which allows the maintenance and 
construction cost of toll facilities that serve interstate commerce to be used in lieu of state matching funds. 
Annually, dollars spent for major maintenance (reconstruction) of turnpikes or new construction may be 
added to the amount of soft match credit available for use as state match. The state’s share of expenditures 
is deducted from the available soft match amount. Federal money would then fund 100 percent of the 
project from the amount that had previously been apportioned for Oklahoma’s highway projects. 
 

95



Notes to the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal Awards 
 

 

The Department utilized $50,246,512 of the soft match provision for projects billed during fiscal year 2018. 
These soft match dollars are applied to the approved construction projects when expenditures are incurred, 
based on the soft match percentage. It should be noted that the amount of soft match credit utilized on the 
progressive estimate billings submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for each project is 
an estimate during the course of the project. The actual amount of soft match utilized for a particular 
project is not determinable until the project is final and the final reconciliation and billing has been 
submitted to FHWA.  
 
Note 7.  Department of Health HIV Care Rebates 
 
Although federal expenditures for CFDA #93.917 - HIV Care Formula Grants are minimal, this program 
also receives drug rebates to help administer the program.  These rebates are not considered federal 
expenditures however they must be restricted and spent in accordance with applicable federal grant 
requirements.  After considering these drug rebates, the Oklahoma State Department of Health expended 
$20,318,535 during 2018 for this program.

Governmental 

Activities & 

General Fund 

State law and accounting policies require agency 

(component unit) financial statements be reported to 

OMES by October 31 each year. The purpose is to allow 

OMES 60 days to issue the state’s Comprehensive 

Accounting Financial Report (CAFR). OMES 

streamlines the preparation of the CAFR by presenting 

the State Auditor and Inspector information as soon as 

the entries are made realizing that formal compilation 

and review is ongoing. 

 

If preliminary data is not submitted until after the CAFR 

is complete, the timeframe for the completion, review 

and audit of the CAFR would be compressed 

significantly. OMES management concurs that this 

process is not ideal but has historically found it necessary 

to meet the deadlines of presenting the CAFR. The short 

time frame for preparation of the CAFR is compounded 

by agencies that routinely miss the October deadline for 

reporting their information.  

 

OMES management will expand interim reviews 

providing more accuracy of preliminary information. 

OMES management will add a financial preparer so the 

manager can focus on review activities. OMES 

management recommends the state allow OMES to 

impose a penalty to agencies that do not submit their 

information timely causing for untimely reviews and 

delays in the CAFR preparation.

Title I Grants to 
Local 
Educational

(LEAs) 

For the majority of student graduation records (approximately 
80% in SY 2018), documentation for students exiting a cohort 
due to transferring to another diploma-issuing institution 
already exists via the receiving Oklahoma public school 
reporting the enrollment directly to OSDE. Thus, a process for 
verifying documentation of students exiting from a school's 
cohort currently exists for the overwhelming majority of 
students. 
  
OSDE is committed to ever-improving data quality and 
accuracy. For this reason, the Office of Accountability has 
developed a yearly report for the Regional Accreditation 
Officers (RAOs) that identifies all students who are exited 
from a cohort and do not have documentation via an enrollment 
record from OSDE's data system, beginning with the 2018 
cohort. When the RAOs conduct their spring audit in 
April/May, the RAOs will verify the documentation for a 
sample of the students, not to be below 10% of the number of 
students identified.  
  
If OSDE determines that a school is not maintaining 
appropriate documentation for a student prior to exiting a 
student from the cohort, OSDE will insert the students lacking 
documentation back into the cohort prior to the reporting of the 
graduation rate.

These processes have been implemented in the 2018-2019 
school year. 
 
To ensure all LEA's funds subject to the 15% carryover 
requirements of Title I, Part A are adequately reviewed, tracked, 
and released, the Office of Federal Programs (OFP) has done the 
following: 
1. Created 2 reports in the Grants Management System (GMS) 
to indicate the LEAs which are subject to the carryover 
limitation: 
     a) One report includes all LEAs and displays their current 
year allocation. 
     b) One report includes only LEAs whose current year 
allocation is greater than $50,000 and are subject to the 15% 
carryover limitation. 
2. Assigned a second OFP reviewer to verify that LEAs subject 
to the carryover limitation were adequately identified, and to 
verify excess carryover calculations. 
3. Established an internal date range (January-March), to ensure 
OFP releases in a timely manner excess carryover funds from 
LEAs who did not liquidate the excess funds within the period 
of performance. 
4. Established procedures which ensure that excess funds were 
released in the appropriate amount from the LEAs who did not 
liquidate the excess funds within the period of performance.

OSDE has developed agency policy and procedures to: 
 Define the criteria used to determine if a school has 

significantly expanded (addition of grade level, addition 
of major curriculum area, etc.). 

 Track the date the OSDE Accreditation department first 
receives notice that a charter school is newly opening or 
significantly expanding to ensure that allocations are 
adjusted in a timely manner. 

 After receiving student counts from Child Nutrition 
division, OFP will follow-up on any allocations which are 
required to be adjusted on or before the date the SEA 
allocates funds to LEAs under the applicable covered 
program for the succeeding academic year. 

 OFP created an internal control spreadsheet to ensure 
proper supporting documentation is maintained for any 
determinations or allocations of new or significantly 
expanding charter schools.

OSDE has written procedures in place that are required to be 
followed by all reviewers, to ensure the consolidated 
monitoring tool and the monitoring logs for FY19 are 
adequately documented, correctly completed, and reviewed 
appropriately.   
 
Starting with FY19, OSDE required all LEAs to submit the 
Schoolwide and Targeted Assistance Plans for all Title I 
schools via the Grants Management System (GMS). The plans 
are monitored by OSDE reviewers throughout the year, and are 
not collected through the Consolidated Monitoring process.

USDA maintains an Administrative Review (AR) process that 
is in tremendous detail and very intense.  AR instructions for 
completion are included in documents that the monitors all 
maintain on-site during the week long process.  Myriads of 
documents obtained at the SFA are examined including the 
required percentage of Family Size and Income applications 
(four pages, printed front-to-back) (which could be as many as 
599 applications) as stated in the guidance for completing the 
instrument. The following steps are taken as part of the AR 
process to ensure that there are adequate controls and 
supervision in place during review at the site.     
   

 All new monitoring staff do not go out on ARs unless 
accompanied by senior staff.  New staff are not 
released to complete ANY ARs unaccompanied until 
approved to do so by the supervisor of all field staff.  
This may take plus or minus two years.   

 Various times during the year, the supervisor of field 
staff accompanies those staff members to validate that 
the AR is being conducted as required per USDA 
guidelines.  When the supervisor accompanies the 
field staff, she is also actively monitoring and even 
assisting during the entire review process.  This 
allows the supervisor to evaluate and verify the tests 
performed by the reviewer and determine if they are 
accurate and if the conclusions are valid. 

 Should any field staff member encounter issues with 
unusual scenarios, they call or email the supervisor to 
discuss the procedures at that very time it arises.  
Issues are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.     

 Mandatory training for the Administrative Review 
process and any updates is conducted each May 
during the annual Spring Staff Meeting to prepare all 
16 field staff for that process for the coming year.   

 All ARs, whether for School Food Authorities, 
Summer Food Service Program participants or Child 
Care and Family Day Care Home sponsors, go

through a complete desk audit upon the arrival of the 
completed review into the State Agency for finalizing 
and sending closure or follow-up letters to the 
entities.    
    

Third bullet under “Conditions and Contest” above:   These are 
all done as they are part of the Resource Management portion 
of the Administrative Review.  Instructions say if the SFA is 
not charging the amount that the PLE reflects, non-federal 
funds must cover the difference.  This validation is completed 
during the review. 
 
To address the issue of “maintaining adequate supporting 
documentation that would enable a reviewer to confirm that 
the consultant performed the Admin Review or the SFSP 
review …and confirm the consultant’s conclusions were 
valid,” see attached documents including: 
 

1. Pages 294 and 295 of the 2 CFR PART 200, 
APPENDIX XI, COMPLIANCE SUPPLEMENT, 
APRIL 2017, under Suggested Audit Procedures: 
specifically for Family Size and Income Guidelines 
published by FNS.  The guidance requires that the 
sampling be verified to see the process was performed 
correctly and that changes were made to the eligibility 
status as needed according to documents received 
from families. 
 

2. Email dated 12/14/18, clarifying discussion 
concerning documentation required for the 
Administrative Review process.  As stated in the 
highlighted verbiage:  FNS does not require State 
agencies to include documentation to prove validation 
of questions where further explanations comments 
and/or attachments are not required per the AR tools 
and when the SFA is in compliance. 

 
The 3-month operating balance testwork as part of the School 
Food Account was not being monitored annually per email 
from Southwest Regional USDA office because it was 
monitored during the AR.  After further clarification from the 
SWRO this annual monitoring will resume effective 
immediately.  SFAs with an excess 3-month operating balance 
will receive letters requesting documentation on how excess 
balances were spent.  These letters will be mailed 3/25/2019. 
 
The Benefit Issuance under Eligibility for SFSP Sponsor 
reviews applies only for Camps and Closed Sites. 
 
As a means to help ensure the other items noted in this audit 
are in place, more in-depth training on the actual process of the 
review will be implemented.  Training for the SFSP monitors 
will be more intense to ensure compliance as well.  
Additionally, for future audits, Child Nutrition staff will work 
with the auditors and the SFAs to obtain documentation from 
the SFAs that are critical to conduct test work to the extent it 
is reasonable, cost effective, can be safeguarded and meets all 
the data security requirements.

USDA maintains an Administrative Review process that is in 
tremendous detail and very intense.  AR instructions for 
completion are included in documents the monitors all 
maintain on-site during the process.  Documents are obtained 
and examined at the center or sponsor locations including the 
required percentage of Family Size and Income applications 
(four pages, printed front-to-back) as stated in the guidance for 
completing the monitoring instrument.    
 
Training for the Administrative Review process is conducted 
each May during the annual Spring Staff Meeting to prepare 
for that process.  Staff turnover could be attributed to a very 
small part of the issues noted above, but very little.  All 
Administrative Reviews, whether for School Food Authorities, 
Summer Food Service Program participants or Child Care and 
Family Day Care Home sponsors, go through a complete desk 
audit upon the arrival of the completed review into the State

Staff turnover in Child Nutrition beginning 6/1/15, included a 
complete new staff either completely new to the agency or new 
to the responsibilities of the program now assigned to within 
Child Nutrition.  Nationwide changes to OMB compliance 
requirements were also put in place in this timeframe.  Risk 
assessment process is currently being developed by Child 
Nutrition staff with a target date of 10/1/2019.   
Assessment factors will possibly include: 

1. Using overclaims as a percentage of meal errors 
compared to the number of meals claimed.  This flag 
would then require follow-up review for at least the 
one area of deficiency.    

2. Repeat violations of any over claim issues. 
3. Any SFA that has implemented a Loan Agreement for 

their Child Nutrition. 
Others are being developed for implementation as seen 
necessary by the Child Nutrition staff as a whole.

USDA Regulations (2CFR 200 subpart (f)) require sub-
recipients to send audits no later than 9 months after the close 
of their FY year. 
Because of staff turnover, the audit log had not been kept 
current.  As of 1/31/19, notifications have been sent to all sub-
recipients to send their audits ASAP.   
The audit log will be updated to include the date of the end of 
the subrecipient’s fiscal year.  A letter will be created and sent 
to the subrecipient at the end of their fiscal year requesting 
supporting documentation in the form a “Summary of Federal 
Expenditures” to verify they did or did not receive $750,000 in 
Federal funds. This letter will also serve as the audit 
notification letter.  Per 2 CFR 200 subpart (f):  Failure to 
submit the organization audit by the due date will result in 
being declared Seriously Deficient as well as possibly being 
proposed for Termination and Disqualification.

The office of Accreditation has taken steps to address the 
issues identified by updating its procedures for reconciliation 
and verification of reports.  The compliance reports are now 
reviewed by 3 other individuals in addition to the compliance 
report preparer.  In addition, Regional Accreditation Officers 
(RAOs) have been asked to compile a list of districts that 
should be receiving deficiencies in a spreadsheet for further 
double checking.   The Alternative Ed compliance report has 
been updated to make the deficiency allocation crystal clear 
from the forms.  It has been implemented in the current year 
and will be fully completed in the next school year. SDE 
continues to work with OMES IT staff to resolve any 
discrepancies in the reports generated by the Accreditation 
Application and to ensure that the reports are accurate.

USDA Memo SFSP 06-2018 dated May 24, 2018, (see 
attached) actually rescinded the regulatory policy 7 CFR.9(d) 
allowing reimbursements not be paid for meals prior to the 
approval of the sponsor’s application.  Therefore up until May 
24, 2018, state agencies were allowed to reimburse for meals 
prior to the approval of an application with Regional Office 
approval. 
 
A change in SFSP Coordinator staff member for the 2018 
summer program, brought notice of several approval date 
issues and payment of claims prior to approval for the 2017 
season.  More training for the SFSP staff is an ongoing process 
to ensure the approvals being completed by USDA’s final 
deadline of June 15.  The Oklahoma deadline for submission 
is April 30, with USDA Regional approval of that date.  In 
2018 there were several requests received asking to submit an 
application after that date.  Only 2 were allowed and those were 
for SFAs wanting to conduct the program during a short 
summer school session.  These were allowed to submit their 
completed applications after that date as schools are 
knowledgeable of conducting USDA food programs from the 
start of a SFSP session.  Therefore, from the summer session 
2018 forward, these errors have not occurred.

In FY18, all the Schoolwide Plans in GMS had the ESSA 
required components. This was an opportunity for all LEAs to 
complete the Schoolwide Plans via GMS, but it was not a 
mandate because Schoolwide Plans were monitored via 
Consolidated Monitoring. 
 
In FY19, OSDE required all LEAs to complete the Schoolwide 
Plans via GMS, therefore ESSA required components are met.  
 
In FY18 OSDE had the following homeless set-aside 
procedures in place: 
1. LEAs 1% homeless set-aside must remain in the function 

code 2199 until the end of FY18. OFP reviewers have 
been trained to manually verify that the proper amount 
was set-aside for  services for homeless students; 

2. OSDE assured with the vendor (MTW Solutions) that  
GMS (Grants Management System) is performing the edit 
check correctly for the required 1% homeless set-aside for 
LEAs with non-Title I sites, to include: the current year 
allocation, any transfers-in, before any transfers-out, and 
without including carryover funds; 

3. OSDE developed a review check list within GMS to be 
used by OFP reviewers to verify the 1% set-aside, in 
addition to the GMS edit check; 

4. OSDE established periodic trainings with OFP reviewers, 
to help strengthen knowledge about ESSA statutory 
requirements for the application review process

OFP has developed written procedures to be followed by the 
Oklahoma State Ombudsman and another assigned staff 
member who will verify all Equitable Services Packets, the 
number of students submitted, and the participation of each 
Private School in the chosen programs. Then, the spreadsheet 
with numbers of private school children is submitted to the 
Director of Finance who ensures that all participating private 
school children are included in the allocation process for each 
current fiscal year. 
 
Starting with FY19, a new page was added in GMS named 
"Nonpublic School Services" which prompts the LEAs to 
describe the types of services that are provided to nonpublic 
students and schools. 
 
The Ombudsman sends a form to LEAs to collect information 
from participating nonpublic schools in regard to the services 
provided, to ensure that actual services were provided to the 
students. 
 
In April-May, the Ombudsman sends out the "Equitable

The FY18 Nonpublic Equitable Share amount (current year 
and carryover) was manually checked by OSDE program 
reviewers for accurate correlation with the budgeted amount 
on the Budget page. In addition, the GMS created the FY18 
closeout report to calculate the nonpublic carryover amount to 
FY19. Under extenuating circumstances, the nonpublic 
carryover amount was manually entered by LEAs in the FY19 
equitable share table. GMS also checks the FY19 program 
specific Nonpublic Equitable Share table against the budget 
and the Nonpublic Services table. 
 
Starting with FY19, a new page was added in GMS named 
"Nonpublic School Services" which prompts the LEAs to 
describe the types of services that are provided to nonpublic 
students and schools. Also, the Ombudsman sends a form to 
LEAs to collect information from participating nonpublic 
schools in regard to the services provided, to ensure that actual 
services were provided to the students. 
 
Each fiscal year, LEAs submit claims that indicate that funds 
allocated for equitable services are obligated in the year for 
which they were appropriated. If there are carryover funds, the 
Ombudsman sends the “Extenuating Circumstances” form to 
LEAs to collect information from participating nonpublic 
schools in regard to the services provided in the previous fiscal 
year, to determine if there were any extenuating circumstances 
that resulted in carryover of the funds to the following fiscal 
year. If there were no extenuating circumstances, the 
unexpended nonpublic school funds are not carried- over to the 
nonpublic share.

with our service provider about these deficiencies and their 
corrective actions during regularly scheduled status meetings. 
These findings and corrective actions are monitored monthly by the

users will request changes to existing edits to the system analysts.  
The system analyst will make the update and document who 
requested the change and why the change was requested.  While 
this does not seem to be a lack of segregation of duties, the system 
analysts particularly assigned to make these changes do agree there 
is an opportunity to enhance the current process.  This is going to 
be done by: 

1) CO 21575 is being implemented to force a notation in the
MMIS when any update is made to an edit.  Currently,
notes are made but the notes are not required in the system
and can be forgotten.  This removes the possibility of
missing documentation.

2) System Analysts will redirect OHCA business users to the
reference file change request system overseen by the
System Integrity Unit in the Program Integrity Unit.  This
will be a central location for requests and approval.  Once
the system analyst has made the change in production the
requester will be informed and instructed to review claims
entering the system to properly monitor the change.
This process will be for changing existing edits and audits
and creating new audits.   Any new edits would be a result
of a Change Order and therefore would not be subject to
this process.

The Oklahoma Health Care Authority (OHCA) concurs in part and 
does not concur in part with the finding stated above in the 
“Condition and Context” section.  The OHCA concurs that it does 
not currently have a written policy or procedure regarding the 
requirements of 42 C.F.R. §§ 455.12 – 455.23.  However, OHCA 
disagrees that these CFR provisions require the State Medicaid 
Agency (SMA) to have a written policy or procedure to implement 
the CFR requirements.  Furthermore, OHCA believes that our 
internal fraud review methods and criteria comply with the CFR 
requirements to identify, preliminarily investigate, review, and 
refer suspected cases of fraud.  As partially outlined in the finding 
above, OHCA’s internal methods and criteria are communicated 
with and known by the Program Integrity (PI) Division, and OHCA 
has routinely set internal meetings between Legal and PI to discuss 
questionable providers based on PI’s preliminary findings.  If the 
result of the discussion of these meetings is to investigate or review 
further, then regularly scheduled internal meetings within OHCA 
Legal are utilized to further discuss and review the providers before 
an ultimate decision to refer the provider to the Oklahoma Attorney 
General’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit (MFCU) is made. 

The finding states that the SAI could not determine that the agency 
took appropriate steps to investigate and, if appropriate, make a  
referral, although it admitted that it was able to verify a listing of 
cases referred by OHCA with a listing of cases received by 
MFCU.  The OHCA believes that the verification of cases referred

demonstrates that OHCA has taken appropriate steps to identify, 
preliminarily investigate, review, and refer suspected cases of fraud 
to MFCU as required by the applicable CFR provisions. 
Furthermore, contrary to the statement above in the “Effect” 
Section, OHCA does not believe that access to its investigatory case 
files themselves will help to determine if appropriate steps were 
taken to investigate and appropriately refer suspected cases of fraud 
to MFCU.  The OHCA believes it has provided enough information 
and documentation to demonstrate that it has a verifiable process 
for referral and that it does, in fact, comply with that process. 

Additionally, OHCA believes that both the attorney-client 
privilege, including attorney work product and attorney-client 
communication, and 56 O.S. §1004(D) govern the internal 
investigatory case files of OHCA.  Specifically, 56 O.S. §1004(D), 
which is part of the Oklahoma Medicaid Program Integrity Act, 
states, “Records obtained or created by the Authority or the 
Attorney General pursuant to the Oklahoma Medicaid Program 
Integrity Act shall be classified as confidential information and 
shall not be subject to the Oklahoma Open Records Act or to 
outside review or release by any individual except, if authorized 
by the Attorney General, in relation to legal, administrative, or 
judicial proceeding.”  (Emphasis added.)  The OHCA believes it 
would be in violation of this specific statute, as well as a breach of 
the attorney-client privilege doctrine, if it were to allow SAI to 
review any internal investigatory case file that was created pursuant 
to this statute. 

Lastly, OHCA believes that it is important to note that there is not 
a finding stating that it does not comply with the CFR requirements 
to identify, preliminarily investigate, review, or refer suspected 
cases of fraud.  In fact, the finding specifically states that SAI has 
verified that cases have been referred by OHCA to MFCU.  Rather, 
the finding is that OHCA does not have a written policy or 
procedure to implement the CFR requirements. 

Should HHS/OIG ultimately determine that a written policy or 
procedure is mandatory, OHCA can have a written policy in place 
within one (1) month of the final determination.  However, OHCA 
would request a telephone conference among appropriate 
representatives of the SAI, HHS/OIG, and OHCA so that all 
agencies can fully discuss what would constitute a reasonable 
written policy that would address the concerns of all the agencies 
involved.

funds. In these policies, OSDH has also addressed proper 
procedures for drawing federal funds for the grant.

TANF Cluster 
 

Concur. Adoption Assistance subsidies are a legal and 
appropriate use of TANF. Many states, like Oklahoma, use 
TANF funds to cover certain foster care and adoption related 
expenditures to assist with the care and stability of children as 
permanent homes are being established. This is done with the 
intent of fulfilling the first purpose of TANF: “Provide 
assistance to needy families so that children can be cared for 
in their own homes or in the homes of relatives”.  
  
In Oklahoma, children in state custody were historically 
certified for Child Only TANF prior to the adoption taking 
place. With children being eligible for TANF at the time of 
the certification, the agency believed the Adoption Assistance 
for the children qualified without the parental means test.   
  
This audit finding has led DHS leadership to understand that 
the TANF expenditures for adoption assistance specifically 
for non-IVE eligible children must have a means test for the 
adoptive family.  Beginning with state fiscal year 2019 
expenditures, the agency has stopped charging any non-IVE 
Adoption Assistance subsidies to TANF. In the future, the 
agency will only charge non-IVE Adoption Assistance 
subsidies to TANF with an approved parental means test 
established within Child Welfare Services.

Bullet One: Concur.  The 3 offices have been notified to keep 
the key to their card inventory in a secure location, with 
access restricted to designated staff.  Additionally, all field 
offices have been instructed that keys to card inventory are to 
be kept in a secure location as instructed in the EBT 
Specialist Handbook.  Bullet Two: Concur.  The seven offices 
were notified and the cards have been moved to a more 
secure location inside each county director’s office, with 
access restricted to designated staff.  Bullet Three:  Concur.  
This office is a satellite office maintained by another county 
office, staffed by the sister office and housed in another 
entity’s building.  Due to low card activity by the satellite 
office, EPS State Office allows the sister office to provide 
card stock to the satellite office with instructions that each 
office must document their transactions.  Both offices have 
been notified again that all transfers of card stock must be 
properly documented and be maintained for 3 years.  Bullet 
Four:  Concur on 7 of the 8 offices noted above.  Those 
offices have been notified that all offices with two or more 
staff members must have two signatures verifying the count 
daily per the EBT Handbook.   The daily count is maintained 
at each office.  Each office submits the bulk inventory report 
to EPS state office monthly.  We do not concur on 1 of the 8 
offices noted above.   That office is a satellite office and is 
staffed with only one individual, making it impossible to have 
2 different signatures.  The EPS state office has authorized 
this office to have their daily log reviewed once a week by a 
supervisor or someone else designated by the county director.  
Bullet Five:  Do not concur on cards returned by the client, 
replaced by the county office using the centralized printing of 
SNAP.  Those returned cards are automatically deactivated 
when a new EBT card is printed.  Concur on cards returned to 
any DHS office by a third party (police, retailers, non-
cardholder, etc).  The EBT Specialist Handbook instructs 
individuals to check for card status and if active, deactivate.  
Instructions have also been sent to all EBT Specialists in the 
field and the county directors outlining instances where 
manual deactivation is required.  Bullet Six:  Concur on one 
of the offices noted above.  Do not concur on the second 
office cited above.  That office is a satellite office with only 
one employee.  Since returned cards cannot be held over 24 
hours this office must log the card on the destruction log, 
check the card status, deactivate if needed and sign off.  
There is no other person to witness or sign off.  All other 
offices have been instructed on the proper card destruction 
process as outlined in the EBT Handbook. 
 
Final Note:  The EPS State Office along with AFS leadership 
are working together to ensure all existing EBT Specialists 
review the EBT Handbook.  This handbook is updated 
electronically each year by the EPS State Office and emailed 
to existing and new EBT Specialists.  Each EBT Specialist 
must sign an access form stating they have read and 
understand the handbook.  The access form is maintained by 
EPS in a locked file cabinet in the EPS office area. The EPS 
office has revised the handbook for 2019, adding clarification 
on some changes and put some requirements in more than one 
place.  The AFS division performs audits annually on all 
county offices and along with EPS, will start performing 
audits on all county offices twice a year.  Additionally, the

In a OMES/OPERS Pathfinder forum on May 31, 2018 it was 
mentioned, beginning in March 2018, that state agencies 
should cease billing federal programs for excess contributions 
redirected to the state’s defined benefit plan.  However, 
comments made by OMES/OPERS in this forum indicated 
there was a possibility OMES may have enough appropriated 
funds left over from refunding contributions through February 
2018, to cover the remaining months of state fiscal year 2018.  
On August 29, 2018 DHS contacted OMES’ State 
Comptroller, inquiring about the final settlement of 
unallowable charges for SFY 2018.  We were told OMES is 
waiting on official correspondence from DHHS Cost 
Allocation Services.  They will not know how far funds will 
stretch until more negotiating happens.  They did indicate the 
original directive to cease billing in March 2018 has not 
changed. 
It was DHS’ intent to make the necessary cost allocation 
adjustment for the February 21, 2018 through June 30, 2018 
period, once a final response was received from OMES.  An 
adjustment by DHS, and later payment from OMES, would 
have resulted in a duplicate reimbursement to the federal 
government, and possibly yet another adjustment to the cost 
allocation reports.  Since no further word has been received 
from OMES DHS will make the cost allocation adjustment for 
the quarter ending March 31, 2019.  DHS’ share of the $81,476 
in questioned costs listed above is $30,554.54.  The rest 
belongs to OMES. A copy of the adjustment will be provided 
to the state auditors. 
Starting with the July 1, 2018 quarter (FY19) DHS has made 
quarterly cost allocation adjustments reversing all Pathfinder 
contributions redirected to the state’s defined pension plan.  
Adjustments will continue to be made quarterly, until further 
notice.

In a OMES/OPERS Pathfinder forum on May 31, 2018 it was 
mentioned, beginning in March 2018, that state agencies 
should cease billing federal programs for excess contributions 
redirected to the state’s defined benefit plan.  However, 
comments made by OMES/OPERS in this forum indicated 
there was a possibility OMES may have enough appropriated 
funds left over from refunding contributions through February 
2018, to cover the remaining months of state fiscal year 2018.  
On August 29, 2018 DHS contacted OMES’ State 
Comptroller, inquiring about the final settlement of 
unallowable charges for SFY 2018.  We were told OMES is 
waiting on official correspondence from DHHS Cost 
Allocation Services.  They will not know how far funds will 
stretch until more negotiating happens.  They did indicate the 
original directive to cease billing in March 2018 has not 
changed.

During the month of April, 2018, DAC staff went back through all 2015, 2016 and 2017 
grants and identified those requiring single audits that we had not received.  The single 
audit reports were requested from subrecipients and were uploaded into the online 
grant management system (OKGrants) upon receipt.  Documentation of receipt of the 
single audit reports is maintained in the Monitoring Determination Spreadsheet. In 
addition, the new position of Compliance Officer was hired in SFY 18.  Part of the duties 
of the Compliance Officer is to monitor subrecipient compliance with the single audit 
requirements.  The training of subrecipients on audit requirements took place in 
September, 2018.  This finding was fully corrected in SFY 19 with the implementation of 
the attached Policy and Procedures for Monitoring VOCA Subrecipients Timely 
Submission of Single Audit Reports.

Program Name: Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Cluster 
Status: Not Corrected; During the period of review, OSDH’s internal financial system did not reflect changes to 
CFDA numbers during the state fiscal year. On July 1/2018, OSDH financial staff implemented changes to 
accurately reflect and post grants separately in the statewide accounting system along with their corresponding 
CFDA numbers. The changes included creating sub-accounts and operating unit field options to be used in the 
Statewide Accounting System, to mirror revenue source, federal fiscal year, service chief, and locations utilized in 
FISCAL(OSDH’s current internal system). This will allow clear reconciliation and reporting of expenditures

Pension Contributions for Employees on Defined Benefit Plan 

The State of Oklahoma ("State") has a retirement plan which consists of both a defined benefit 
plan component and a defined contribution plan component (the plan is known as "Pathfinder").  
The Pathfinder plan was implemented during the year ended June 30, 2016.  Under Pathfinder, 
participating employees contribute a minimum of 4.5% of their compensation.  Participating 
employers match employee contributions up to 7%.  In addition to the matching contributions, 
participating employers are required to remit to the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement 
System ("OPERS") the difference between the matching contributions for Pathfinder members and 
the amount the participating employer would have contributed for a legacy defined benefit plan 
member.  For each employee in the Pathfinder plan, the employer contributed either 9.5% or 10.5% 
of salary to the defined benefit plan. 

The State maintains that the entire contribution is a required expense for the employee participating 
in the Pathfinder plan. 

As required by the FY19 SWCAP agreement, the State has provided details on the amount of 
contributions that were remitted to OPERS on behalf of employees participating in the Pathfinder 
plan.  The State also has completed an analysis of the federal funding percentage ("FFP") for those 
contributions.  The time period included in the analysis begins at the inception of employee 
participation in Pathfinder (on November 1, 2015) and ends on February 20, 2018, the date upon 
which the State notified its agencies that they may not charge federal programs for the amount 
remitted to the defined benefit plan. 

Certain agencies have already dealt with this issue and are handling any repayment directly with 
their cognizant agency.  FFP was calculated by soliciting information from each agency for each 
individual participating in Pathfinder.  The State's agencies provided the federal reimbursement 
rate for individuals who participate in federal programs. 

The total amount of contributions to the defined benefit component on behalf of employees 
participating in Pathfinder is $19,195,712.  Of this amount, the federal portion is $2,826,484 and 
the calculated FFP is 14.7%.

December 22, 2018 

To the Honorable Mary Fallin, Governor 
Members of the Legislature, and  
Citizens of the State of Oklahoma 

The Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES) is pleased to present the Comprehensive 
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for the State of Oklahoma for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. This 
report is presented in three sections — introductory, financial and statistical — as the primary means of 
reporting the state government's financial activities. Its objectives are to provide a clear picture of the 
government as a single, unified entity and to provide traditional fund based financial statements. The CAFR 
has been prepared in conformity with relevant Governmental Accounting Standards Board statements. 

The Introductory Section contains an overview of the state's economic performance, a review of current 
initiatives and summary financial data. The Financial Section contains Management’s Discussion and 
Analysis, Government-wide Financial Statements and Fund Financial Statements for governmental funds, 
proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar component units, and major component units. The Financial 
Section also includes the Notes to the Financial Statements, Required Supplementary Information and 
Other Supplementary Information. The Statistical Section contains selected financial and demographic 
information. Management’s Discussion and Analysis contains complementary information, and readers are 
encouraged to review this section. 

PROFILE OF THE GOVERNMENT 

Management of the state, through OMES, is responsible for the accuracy, fairness and completeness of the 
financial statements presented in this report. The statements have been prepared in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles. To the best of our knowledge and belief, the information 
presented is accurate in all material respects and includes all disclosures necessary for an understanding of 
the state's financial position and activities. The governor and Legislature govern all funds and accounts for 
every executive agency, board, commission, public trust, authority, college and university whose data are 
presented in this report. The financial reporting entity, the State of Oklahoma, includes these funds, 
organizations, agencies, boards, commissions and authorities. In accordance with Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board Statement 61, the state financial reporting entity includes 19 component units. 
There are six major component units, seven nonmajor component units, and six fiduciary component units. 
The major and nonmajor component units are discretely presented in the financial statements. The fiduciary 
component units are presented in the fiduciary fund and similar component units’ financial statements, 
along with the other fiduciary activities of the state. The fiduciary activities are not included in the 
Government-wide Financial Statements because the resources of these funds are not available to support 
the state’s own programs. 

State finances are governed by rules designed to ensure sound, conservative management. The Legislature 
cannot appropriate more than 95 percent of the general revenue expected to be collected in the coming 
year. The state Board of Equalization, an independent board not subject to legislative control, establishes 
the legislative appropriation authority. Unlike many states that use seasonal borrowing to meet cash 
demands, Oklahoma maintains a cash flow reserve sufficient to meet fluctuating cash needs. General 
obligation indebtedness is prohibited without a vote of the people. When revenue receipts are less than 
estimated, the Director of Finance is mandated by the Oklahoma Constitution to declare a revenue shortfall 
and reduce appropriations, as required, to allow appropriations to be covered by current year tax 
collections.

The state’s financial statements were audited by the Office of the State Auditor and Inspector. The goal of the 
independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of the state for the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2018, are free of material misstatement. The audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and the significant 
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor 
concluded that, based upon the audit, there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion and that the State 
of Oklahoma’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, are fairly presented in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The independent auditor’s report is presented as the first component of 
the Financial Section of this report.  
 
Internal Controls 
 
Management of the State of Oklahoma is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of internal accounting 
controls designed to ensure assets are safeguarded and financial transactions are properly recorded and adequately 
documented. Such internal controls require estimates and judgments from management so that, in attaining reasonable 
assurance as to the adequacy of such controls, the cost does not exceed the benefit obtained. 
 
Budget and Fiscal Policy 
 
The budget process begins when each agency, other than the Legislature, that expends money through the state treasury 
submits an annual budget request to OMES. Copies are also provided to the legislative fiscal staffs. These requests are 
reviewed and analyzed for the governor by OMES. The governor then makes formal recommendations in the executive 
budget which is presented to the Legislature on the first day of the legislative session. During the legislative session, 
legislative committees review agency needs and recommend appropriation levels. Then the Legislature must approve all 
appropriation bills to fund agency operations for the next fiscal year. Appropriation bills provide for state appropriated 
funds and establish spending limits for state agencies. The governor can accept, reject or line-item veto particular 
legislative appropriations. Before encumbering or spending money in the fiscal year, each agency must submit a budget 
work program to OMES. The program outlines, by account, fund source and program category, how the agency plans to 
spend the available state, federal and revolving funds during the fiscal year. OMES must approve an agency’s budget 
work program before agencies can encumber or spend available funds. 
 
Oklahoma's Constitution restricts total appropriations to 95 percent of estimated general revenues. The Board of 
Equalization is responsible for approving the official itemized estimate of revenues based upon information provided by 
OMES and the Oklahoma Tax Commission and sets the amount of legislative appropriations authority. The board is 
comprised of six elected officials and the president of the state Board of Agriculture. The six elected officials are the 
governor, the state auditor and inspector, the state treasurer, the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, and the 
superintendent of public instruction.  
 
The constitution requires that collections in excess of the Board of Equalization’s itemized estimate of general revenue 
fund revenues be deposited to the Stabilization or “Rainy Day” Fund each year until the balance of the “Rainy Day” Fund 
equals 15 percent of the prior fiscal year's General Revenue Fund certified appropriations authority. In November 2004, 
Oklahoma voters enacted restrictions on the use of the “Rainy Day” Fund. Up to one-fourth of the July 1 balance each 
year may be appropriated upon an emergency declaration by the governor with concurrence of two-thirds of the House 
and Senate, or by a declaration of an emergency by the House speaker and Senate’s president pro tempore with 
concurrence of three-fourths of the members of each legislative body. Up to three-eighths of the fund may be accessed if 
the Board of Equalization is forecasting a decline in state revenues for the coming fiscal year and up to three-eighths may 
be utilized in the event of a current year revenue shortfall. 
 
The state also has an oversight process for the issuance of debt. The Council on Bond Oversight is responsible for the 
review and approval of all debt issued by the state, its agencies and public trusts, and performs an assessment of all capital 
leases.

Proprietary Operations 

The state's proprietary operations are comprised of governmental agencies and quasi-governmental agencies providing 
goods or services to the public on a user charge basis. These activities are financed and operated in a manner similar to 
private business enterprises. They operate with the intent to recover the costs of operations from those directly benefiting 
from the goods or services. Some of the activities included in the state's proprietary operations are power generating 
plants, turnpikes, medical services, insurance, and financing services for both public and private entities. 
 
Capital Assets 
 
These financial statements include the capital assets of the state. A discussion of capital assets accounting is included in 
the Management Discussion and Analysis that is part of the basic financial statements. More detailed information about 
capital assets can be found in the notes to the financial statements.  

 
ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK 

 
While diversification efforts continue to reduce the state’s dependence on oil and natural gas tax revenues, the energy 
sector remains an important driver of the Oklahoma economy. After weathering a significant two-year downturn in 
energy prices, Oklahoma’s economy has continued to expand throughout 2018. 
 
Oklahoma carries a low tax-supported debt burden overall, with continued declining annual debt service payments. The 
state constitution requires voter approval of all state general obligation (GO) bonds with the stipulation that they be 
secured by a specific tax revenue stream. Currently, the state’s only GO bonds of this type matured in July of 2018. 
 
State pension plans recently reported excellent investment performance and continuing funding level improvements. 
Oklahoma has seven pension systems of which the Teachers Retirement System (OTRS) and the Public Employee 
Retirement System (OPERS) compose 80 percent of total pension fund assets. The Oklahoma State Pension Commission 
reported at the end of November that the actuarial funded status of six of the seven systems increased in fiscal year 2018. 
The funded ratio for the OTRS was reported at 72.9 percent. It is the largest state pension system, accounting for just over 
one-half of all pension assets. The second largest system, OPERS, holds nearly 30 percent of all assets and ended 2018 
with a funded ratio of 97.7 percent. Combined, all state systems currently have a funded ratio of just over 80 percent for 
2018.  
 
Data from the United States (U.S.) Department of Labor and the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission reports 
that October 2018 job growth in Oklahoma was flat and unemployment reached a 10-year low of 3.4 percent. Oklahoma’s 
unemployment rate is currently outperforming the national average of 3.7 percent. The largest gains in employment since 
last year were in the mining and logging industry, which added 6,900 jobs as a result of recovering oil prices. Oklahoma 
added 23,200 jobs through October 2018 year-to-date. Metropolitan areas grew at a more rapid pace compared to non-
metro regions and were primary job growth drivers for the state. For September 2018, Oklahoma City’s unemployment 
rate stood at 2.8 percent and Tulsa at 3.0 percent.  
 
Oklahoma’s economy continued to expand in 2018 along with the national economy. According to the most recent real 
gross domestic product (GDP) data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Oklahoma’s annualized GDP 
grew by 1.7 percent in Q1 and 4.1 percent in Q2, while the U.S. economy grew 2.2 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively. 
Oklahoma ranked 16th in the nation for GDP growth through the second quarter. This is a significant improvement over 
2017, where Oklahoma GDP grew 0.7 percent but lagged behind the national growth of 2.2 percent.  
 
According to Baker Hughes Rig Count, as of Nov. 21, 2018, 144 rigs were drilling in the state, up from 122 a year ago. 
Rig counts are still well below pre-2015 downturn levels, which had 214 rigs in November 2014. Oklahoma has the 
second highest rig count nationwide after Texas (450).  
 
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices moved significantly upward since reaching a sub-$30 a barrel bottom in 
2016. However, after breaching $70 a barrel several times this year, all gains have been erased by November as WTI 
crude prices briefly dipped below $50, the lowest since October 2017. Current Energy Information Administration (EIA) 
estimates expect spot prices for the WTI to average $65 a barrel in 2019. The next EIA estimate release is scheduled for 
Dec. 11, 2018.  
 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 10 

The latest EIA release of monthly Oklahoma crude oil production numbers reflect August 2018 production at a record 
17,445 thousand barrels, which is over 20 percent more than pre-2015 downturn levels. Despite record oil production, rig 
counts and worker numbers are below 2014 levels. Technology and drilling, as well as production improvements by the 
oil and gas industry, enable many companies to operate leaner without slashing production goals. 
 
The aerospace industry continues to be one of the most important contributors to Oklahoma’s economy. This year 
Oklahoma hosted the annual National Association of State Aviation Officials. The theme of the convention was 
“Oklahoma – Aircraft Repair Capital of the World.” Tinker Air Force Base is the world’s largest military aircraft repair 
facility and the American Airlines maintenance base in Tulsa is the world’s largest commercial aircraft repair facility. 
According to Victor Bird, director of the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission, the aerospace industry supports 206,000 
jobs with an annual payroll of $11.7 billion and an average salary of $73,300.  
 
Durable goods and real estate made the largest non-oil and gas extraction contributions to Oklahoma’s GDP in the second 
quarter at 0.5 percent each. Growth in employment occurred in all industries except for financial activities, construction, 
arts and entertainment and non-durable goods. Professional services and trade, transportation, and utilities had the 
strongest 12-month job growth for non-oil industries at 2.8 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively.  
 
According to the Oklahoma Economic Report published by the State Treasurer, monthly gross receipts for October 2018 
reached a record $1.1 billion, or growth of more than 16 percent. The running 12-month gross receipts were $12.7 billion. 
All major revenue streams grew over the last 12 months. Individual income tax reflected strong employment growth with 
receipts growing more than 9 percent in the past year. Sales tax receipts were also strong at 10 percent growth year-over-
year. New revenues generated from tax rate increases approved by House Bill 1010XX made a significant contribution of 
4.9 percent of October gross receipts.  
 
Comparisons of treasury gross receipts include all collections received through the Oklahoma Tax Commission before 
refunds and rebates, and include taxes levied by cities and counties which are not state revenues. This report, according to 
the State Treasurer, is meant to reflect general state macro-economic activity and present snapshots in time to indicate 
rising or falling economic conditions. General Revenue Fund collections, as reported by OMES, and other state revenues 
funding the state budget do not correlate directly to gross receipts. 
 
For this reason, Oklahoma state government, pursuant to the state constitution, builds a 5 percent cushion into every 
appropriated state budget to reduce the risk of mandatory budget reductions if revenues fall below the 100 percent 
estimate. If collections to the General Revenue Fund are projected to fall more than 5 percent below the official estimate 
during any fiscal year, a revenue failure is declared and mandatory appropriation reductions must occur to maintain a 
balanced budget. 
 
Fiscal year 2018 collections to the General Revenue Fund totaled 7 percent, or $381.6 million, above the 100 percent 
official estimate, resulting in the surplus being deposited to the Oklahoma Constitutional Reserve Fund (“Rainy Day” 
Fund), bringing the reserve fund balance to just over $450 million.  
 
Receipts to the General Revenue Fund are trending modestly positive over the first four months of fiscal year 2019. 
OMES reports collections to the fund to be $20.4 million, or 1 percent, above the year-to-date estimate through October 
2018, and $202.6 million, or 11.5 percent, above prior year collections. For fiscal year 2019, increased revenues are 
expected and target estimates are higher than actuals from the previous year – meaning that collections constantly above 
the prior year are not only expected but necessary just to meet current year state allocations. During the last two regular 
legislative sessions, as well as in two special sessions, state policymakers have increased recurring revenues for upcoming 
fiscal years and substantially reduced the use of non-recurring revenues in the fiscal year 2019 budget. 
 
When asked in November how the recent drop in oil prices might play out into the coming year, OMES director Denise 
Northrup advised, “While most reporting categories appear to be on a stable footing through these first four months, the 
recent slump in crude oil prices gives rise to some concern as we prepare to finish out 2018 and look forward to 2019.” 
 
In September 2018, Moody’s affirmed Oklahoma’s Aa2 credit rating and revised the state’s outlook from negative to 
stable. Governor Mary Fallin credited the recent tax package and reduction on reliance on one-time revenue sources.  
 
In November, the Oklahoma State Treasurer reported that the Oklahoma Business Conditions Index has topped growth 
neutral for 15 consecutive months. The October index of 55 indicates that economic growth is anticipated during the next 
three to six months.

Revenue Collections and Estimates 
 
As noted in a preceding subsection, the budget is prepared using cash available plus 95 percent of the itemized revenue 
estimate as approved by the state Board of Equalization. It should be noted that taxes deposited into the budgetary 
General Revenue Fund, as defined by Oklahoma law, are approximately 75 percent of the total tax revenues of the 
governmental funds, as defined by GAAP. However, the budgetary General Revenue Fund should not be confused with 
the general fund as presented in the accompanying GAAP-basis financial statements, as the two terms are not 
interchangeable. For example, the GAAP-basis general fund includes revenues deposited to the state Transportation Fund, 
federal grant proceeds, revolving fund revenues, fees and charges as well as other money used in the general operations of 
government which are not considered in the Board of Equalization's estimates of tax revenues. 
 
During 2017, the most recent data available, receipts from three of the five major taxes were less than revenues of the 
prior year. The taxes combined for $4.2 billion, or 94.9 percent of total receipts for the same categories in the prior year. 
The total of major taxes collected decreased $228 million or 5.1 percent from that of the previous year. As compared to 
fiscal year 2016, collections from income taxes decreased by $238 million, or 10.6 percent; sales taxes decreased by $44 
million, or 2.3 percent; motor vehicle taxes decreased $9 million, or 4.1 percent; and gross production taxes on gas and oil 
increased by $62 million, or 65.7 percent. 
 
Oklahoma has established an enviable record in recent years for its revenue forecasting results. Since enactment of a 
constitutional amendment in 1985 establishing new revenue estimating procedures, collections have exceeded the 
estimate in 17 years and dipped below the estimate 15 years. The comparison of estimated revenues to actual collections 
for fiscal year 2017 is as follows:

OKLAHOMA ♦ 15 

The 15-year comparative history of estimated to actual collections is shown in the following table: 
 
 

 
 

The status of three important fund balances affecting the new year’s fiscal picture is explained as follows: 
 
Cash-Flow Committed Fund – Each year, 10 percent of the General Revenue Fund’s certified appropriation level is set 
aside to meet anticipated monthly cash flow needs for the new fiscal year. At the close of fiscal year 2018, the amount the 
state set aside was $874.9 million. 
 
General Revenue Fund – In fiscal year 2018, there were amendments to the budget that netted an additional $125.7 
million. Carried-over amounts from prior years of $39.4 million were added to the budget compared to a $49.1 million 
carry-over in fiscal year 2017. Carry-over funds reflect the difference between the 95 percent appropriation limit and 
actual receipts up to 100 percent of the estimate. Funds required to replenish or increase the cash-flow committed fund 
also come from this source. An additional $92.7 million was added to fund a portion of the ad valorem reimbursement to 
schools. OMES was awarded an additional $13.9 million to cover debt service payments for bonds associated with the 
project to restore the State Capitol Building. In addition, the Department of Corrections was given $8.8 million in 
supplementary funding. Offsetting the additions to the budget were statewide reductions caused by revenue shortfalls. 
  
Constitutional “Rainy Day” Fund - At the start of each fiscal year, collections that exceed the estimate for the 
preceding year are automatically deposited in the “Rainy Day” Fund until the total balance equals 15 percent of the prior 
year's certified collections for the General Revenue Fund. As a result of different triggers for making the funds available 
for use, any amounts deposited to the fund are split between unassigned and restricted fund balance. For the fiscal year 
beginning July 1, 2018, the restricted portion had a balance of $338.7 million and the unassigned portion had a balance of 
$112.9 million, giving the total Constitutional Fund a balance of $451.6 million.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Management of the State of Oklahoma provides this Management's Discussion and Analysis of the State of Oklahoma’s 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) for readers of the state’s financial statements. This narrative overview 
and analysis of the financial activities of the State of Oklahoma is for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We encourage 
readers to consider this information in conjunction with the additional information that is furnished in the Letter of 
Transmittal, which can be found preceding this narrative, and with the state’s financial statements which follow.  

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS - PRIMARY GOVERNMENT 

Government-Wide Highlights: 

Net Position - The assets plus deferred outflows of resources of the state exceeded its liabilities and deferred inflows of 
resources at fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, by $19.8 billion (presented as "net position"). Of this amount, $2.4 billion 
was reported as "unrestricted net position". Unrestricted net position represents the amount available to be used to meet 
the state’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. 

Changes in Net Position - The state's total net position increased by $1.1 billion (a 5.8% increase) in fiscal year 2018 after 
a 1.6% increase during the previous fiscal year. Net position of governmental activities increased by $985.6 million (a 
5.9% increase), while net position of the business-type activities showed an increase of $90.3 million (a 4.6% increase).  

Fund Highlights: 

Governmental Funds - Fund Balances - As of the close of fiscal year 2018, the state's governmental funds reported a 
combined ending fund balance of $7.3 billion, an increase of $602.1 million in comparison with the prior year. Of this 
total amount, $3.7 billion represents nonspendable fund balance, with $77.1 million being in the general fund. Amounts 
that can be spent include $1.1 billion of restricted fund balance, $2.3 billion of committed fund balance, $41.8 million of 
assigned fund balance, and $112.9 million of unassigned fund balance. The portion of fund balance which is available is 
roughly 20.9% of the total governmental expenditures for the year. 

Long-term Debt: 

The state's total long-term debt obligations showed a net decrease of $53.9 million (3.9%) in the governmental type 
activities and a net increase of $51.2 million (5.9%) in the business type activities during the current fiscal year. 

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

This discussion and analysis are intended to serve as an introduction to the State of Oklahoma’s basic financial 
statements. The state’s basic financial statements include three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) 
fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains additional required 
supplementary information (budgetary, pension and other postemployment benefit schedules) and other supplementary 
information (combining financial statements) in addition to the basic financial statements themselves. These components 
are described below: 

Basic Financial Statements 

The basic financial statements include two kinds of financial statements that present different views of the state – the 
Government-Wide Financial Statements and the Fund Financial Statements and Combining Major Component Unit 
Financial Statements. These financial statements also include the Notes to the Financial Statements that explain some of 
the information in the financial statements and provide more detail. 



OKLAHOMA ♦ 30 

Government-Wide Financial Statements 

The Government-Wide Financial Statements provide a broad view of the state’s operations in a manner similar to a 
private-sector business. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the state’s financial 
position, which assists in assessing the state’s economic condition at the end of the fiscal year. These are prepared using 
the flow of economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. This means they follow methods 
that are similar to those used by most businesses. They take into account all revenues and expenses connected with the 
fiscal year even if cash involved was not received or paid. The government-wide financial statements include two 
statements: 

The Statement of Net Position presents all of the government's assets and liabilities in addition to deferred inflows and 
outflows, with the difference between the four reported as net position. Over time, increases or decreases in the state's net 
position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the state is improving or declining. 

The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s net position changed during the most 
recent fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change 
occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statement for some 
items that will not result in cash flows until future fiscal periods (such as uncollected taxes and earned but unused 
vacation leave). This statement also presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each 
function of the state. 

Both of the above financial statements have separate sections for three different types of state programs or activities. 
These three types of activities are: 

Governmental Activities – The activities in this section are mostly supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues 
(federal grants). Most services normally associated with state government fall into this category, including education 
(support for both common public schools and higher education), government administration, health services, legal and 
judiciary services, museums, natural resources, public safety and defense, regulatory services, social services, and 
transportation. 

Business-Type Activities – These functions normally are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs 
through user fees and charges to external users of goods and services. These business-type activities of the state include 
the operations of the Oklahoma Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (by the Oklahoma Employment Security 
Commission), the state’s program for making loans to local government units for the acquisition, development, and 
utilization of storage and control facilities for water and sewage systems (by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board), 
administering the insurance benefits for state employees and education workers (by the Employees Group Insurance 
Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services), and the Oklahoma Lottery Commission. These four 
programs operate with minimal assistance from the governmental activities of the state. 

Discretely Presented Component Units – These are operations that have certain independent qualities but for which the 
state has financial accountability. For the most part, these entities operate similarly to private-sector businesses and the 
business-type activities described above. The state’s discretely presented component units are presented in two categories, 
major and nonmajor. This separation is determined by the relative size of the entities’ assets, liabilities, revenues and 
expenses in relation to the total of all component units. 

The state’s six discretely presented major component units are: 

Oklahoma Student Loan Authority 
Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency 
Oklahoma Turnpike Authority 
Grand River Dam Authority 
Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority 
Higher Education Component Unit 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 31 

The state’s seven other (or nonmajor) component units are combined into a single column for reporting in the fund 
financial statements. These nonmajor component units are: 

 
Oklahoma Educational Television Authority 
Oklahoma Industrial Finance Authority 
Multiple Injury Trust Fund 
University Hospitals Authority 
Oklahoma Development Finance Authority 
Oklahoma Capital Investment Board 
Oklahoma State University Medical Authority 

 
Complete financial statements of the individual component units can be obtained from their respective administrative 
offices. Addresses and other additional information about the state’s component units are presented in the Notes to the 
Financial Statements. 
 
The government-wide financial statements can be found immediately following this discussion and analysis. 
 
Fund Financial Statements and Major Component Unit Financial Statements 
 
A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that are segregated for specific 
activities or objectives. The state, like other state and local governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate 
compliance with finance-related legal requirements.  
 
The fund financial statements focus on individual parts of the state government, reporting the state's operations in more 
detail than the government-wide financial statements. All of the funds of the state can be divided into three categories. It 
is important to note that these fund categories use different accounting approaches and should be interpreted differently. 
The three categories of funds are: 
 
Governmental Funds Financial Statements – Most of the basic services provided by the state are financed through 
governmental funds. Governmental funds are essentially used to account for the same functions as governmental activities 
in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, the 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows of spendable resources. They also focus 
on the balances of spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in 
evaluating the government's near-term financing requirements. This is known as using the flow of current financial 
resources measurement focus approach and the modified accrual basis of accounting. These statements provide a detailed 
short-term view of the state’s finances that assists in determining whether there are adequate financial resources available 
to meet the current needs of the state.  
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to 
compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities 
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the 
government’s near-term financing decisions. The Governmental Fund Balance Sheet and the Governmental Fund 
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances both provide a reconciliation to facilitate this 
comparison between governmental funds and the governmental activities. These reconciliations are presented on the page 
immediately following each governmental fund financial statement. 
 
The state has four governmental funds. All four governmental funds are considered major funds for financial reporting 
purposes. These four major funds are – the General Fund, the Commissioners of the Land Office Permanent Fund, the 
Department of Wildlife Conservation Permanent Fund, and the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Permanent Fund. Each 
major fund is presented in a separate column in the Governmental Fund Balance Sheet and in the Governmental Fund 
Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances.  
 
The basic governmental funds financial statements can be found immediately following the government-wide financial 
statements.  
 
Proprietary Funds Financial Statements – These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of 
commercial enterprises. Because these funds charge fees for services provided to outside customers including local 
governments, they are known as enterprise funds. Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 32 

government-wide financial statements, only in more detail. Like the government-wide financial statements, proprietary 
fund financial statements use the accrual basis of accounting. There is no reconciliation needed between the government-
wide financial statements for business-type activities and the proprietary fund financial statements. 
 
The state has four enterprise funds, with all four being considered major proprietary funds for presentation purposes. As 
previously mentioned, they are the operations of the Oklahoma Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (by the Oklahoma 
Employment Security Commission), the state’s program for making loans to local government units for the acquisition, 
development, and utilization of storage and control facilities for water and sewage systems (by the Oklahoma Water 
Resources Board), the administration of insurance benefits for state employees by the Employees Group Insurance 
Division (EGID) of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES), and the Oklahoma Lottery Commission.  
 
The basic proprietary funds financial statements can be found immediately following the governmental fund financial 
statements.  
 
Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units Financial Statements – These funds are used to account for resources held 
for the benefit of parties outside the state government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial 
statements because the resources of these funds are not available to support the state’s own programs. The accounting 
used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. They use the accrual basis of accounting. 
 
The state’s fiduciary funds are the pension trust funds (seven separate retirement plans for employees), and the agency 
funds (which account for the assets held for distribution by the state as an agent for other governmental units, other 
organizations or individuals). Individual fund detail can be found in the combining financial statements described below. 
 
The basic fiduciary funds and similar component units’ financial statements can be found immediately following the 
proprietary fund financial statements. 
 
Component Units Financial Statements – As mentioned above, these are operations for which the state has financial 
accountability but they have certain independent qualities as well, and they operate similarly to private-sector businesses. 
The government-wide financial statements present information for the component units in a single column of the 
Statement of Net Position. Also, some information on the Statement of Activities is aggregated for component units. The 
Combining Statement of Net Position and Combining Statement of Activities provide detail for each major component 
unit and the nonmajor component units in aggregate. Individual nonmajor component unit detail can be found in the 
combining financial statements described below. 
 
The basic combining financial statements for major component units can be found immediately following the fiduciary 
fund and similar component unit’s financial statements. 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of the data 
provided in the government-wide and the fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be found 
immediately following component units financial statements.  
 
Required Supplementary Information 
 
The basic financial statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information. This section includes the 
budgetary comparison schedule – budget to actual (non-GAAP budgetary basis), which includes a schedule of 
reconciliation between the statutory fund balance for budgetary purposes and the fund balance for the general fund as 
presented in the governmental fund financial statements. In addition, schedules required by GASB 68 (pension) and 
GASB 75 (other postemployment benefits) are presented. 
 
Budgetary Detail 
 
The schedule of expenditures and intra-agency transfers – detail budget to actual comparison is presented in this section. 
It provides detail comparisons of expenditures and intra-agency transfers at the legal level of control. Comparisons can be 
made between the original budget, final budget, and actual.

Pension Detail 
 
With the implementation of GASB Statement 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions—an amendment of 
GASB Statement No. 27, certain information related to net pension liability and funding of pension plans is reported in the 
Required Supplementary Information section. 
 
Other Postemployment Benefits Detail 

With the implementation of GASB Statement 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Other Postemployment 
Benefits (OPEB), certain information related to Net OPEB Liability and funding of OPEB plans is reported in the required 
supplementary information section. 
 
Combining Financial Statements 
 
The combining financial statements referred to earlier in connection with fiduciary funds and nonmajor component units 
are presented following the required supplementary information. The total of the columns of these combining financial 
statements carry to the applicable fund financial statement. 
 
 
GOVERNMENT-WIDE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 
 
Net Position 
 
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial condition. The state’s 
combined net position (government and business-type activities) totaled $19.8 billion at the end of 2018, compared to 
$18.7 billion at the end of the previous year. 
 
The largest portion of the state’s net position (57.2%) reflects its investment in capital assets such as land, buildings, 
equipment, and infrastructure (road, bridges, and other immovable assets), less any related outstanding debt used to 
acquire those assets. The state uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; consequentially, these assets are not 
available for future spending. Although the state’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should 
be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets 
themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities.

OKLAHOMA ♦ 34 

 
A portion of the state’s net position (30.5%) represents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may 
be used. The remaining balance of unrestricted net position may be used to meet the state's ongoing obligations to citizens 
and creditors. Internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net position. 
 
At the end of the current fiscal year, the state is able to report positive balances in all three categories of net position, both 
for the government as a whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business-type activities. The same situation 
held true for the prior fiscal year. 
 
Changes in Net Position 
 
The state's governmental net position increased by $1.1 billion, or 5.8%. Approximately 52% of the state's total revenue 
came from taxes, while 38% resulted from grants and contributions (including federal aid). Charges for various goods and 
services provided 10% of the total revenues. The state's expenses cover a range of services. The largest expenses were for 
health services, general education, government administration, and social services. In 2018, governmental activity 
expenses exceeded program revenues, resulting in the use of $8.4 billion in general revenues (mostly taxes). The 
business-type activities’ program revenues exceeded their expenses for 2018 by $153.3 million.

Business-Type Activities 
 
The business-type activities increased the state's net position by $90.3 million, a 4.6% increase, to $2.0 billion. This 
increase comes after a decrease of 2.1% in the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from a reduction in benefit 
payments, and claims submitted to the Oklahoma Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (OUITF) which is administered 
by the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. The OUITF net position increased by $46.0 million, OWRB’s net 
position increased by $15.1 million, EGID increased by $32.1 million, and the Oklahoma Lottery Commission had a 
decrease in net position of $3.0 million.  
 
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE'S INDIVIDUAL FUNDS 
 
As noted earlier, the state uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal 
requirements. 
 
Governmental Funds 
 
The focus of the state’s governmental funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows, and balances of 
spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the state’s financing requirements. In particular, unassigned 
fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal 
year. 
 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, the state’s governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $7.3 
billion, an increase of $602.1 million from the prior year. The largest portion $3.7 billion (50.4%) of this total amount 
constitutes nonspendable fund balance, which includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in 
spendable form or legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. In addition $1.1 billion (15.6%) of fund 
balance is classified as restricted meaning that the funds can only be used for specific purposes defined by enabling 
legislation or externally imposed limitations. Amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant to constraints 
of the government’s highest level of decision-making authority are reported as committed fund balance. Committed fund 
balance represents $2.3 billion (31.9%) of total fund balance. Amounts that are constrained by the government’s intent to 
be used for specific purposes, but are neither restricted, nor committed, are reported as assigned fund balance. Assigned 
fund balance represents $41.8 million (0.6%) of total fund balance. The remaining funds that are not classified in any of 
the other four categories represent unassigned fund balance. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 the state has $112.9 
million (1.5%) classified as unassigned fund balance. 
 
The general fund is the chief operating fund of the state. At the end of the current fiscal year, the total fund balance 
increased $472.1 million to $3.6 billion. This 15.0% increase is primarily related to improved tax collections and 
reduction in expenditures.  
 
As a measure of the general fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare the portion of fund balance not classified as 
nonspendable (spendable) and total fund balance to total fund expenditures. Spendable fund balance represents 20.9% of 
total governmental fund expenditures, while total fund balance represents 42.3% of that same amount. 
 
The Commissioners of the Land Office manages land and cash set aside by the Federal Government for the use and 
benefit of public education in Oklahoma to generate maximum earnings for Trust beneficiaries. The Trust beneficiaries 
are common education and thirteen Oklahoma colleges and universities. This year total program revenues were $188 
million compared to $322.8 million for the prior year. Distributions to beneficiaries totaled $129.4 million for fiscal year 
2018 with $32.6 million disbursed to universities and colleges and $93.6 million disbursed to public schools, and $3.2 
million disbursed for public buildings. This was a decrease of $14 million from the apportionments of fiscal year 2017.  
 
The Department of Wildlife’s Lifetime Licenses’ fund balance increased by 2.6% to $87.9 million. This increase occurred 
due to collections for licenses. 
 
The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Permanent Fund holds certain moneys that are received in settlement of claims by 
the state against tobacco manufacturers. Earnings from these moneys are to be utilized for research, education, prevention 
and treatment of tobacco related diseases and certain other health programs. This fund reported $88.3 million net increase 
in fund balance with $54.8 million coming in from the settlement payment by tobacco manufacturers for 2018. The prior 
year’s payment was about $59.5 million. The state now has $1.2 billion in this permanent fund. 
 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 38 

Proprietary Funds 
 
The state’s proprietary fund financial statements provide the same type of information found in the government-wide 
financial statements for business-type activities. This information is presented on the same basis of accounting, but 
provides more detail. 
 
As discussed in the business-type activities section above, the state's net position increased by $90.3 million as a result of 
operations in the proprietary funds. This resulted from a $46.0 million increase in net position by the OUITF, an increase 
in net position of $15.1 million by the Oklahoma Water Resources Board’s (OWRB) program for making loans to local 
government units for drinking and waste water facilities, an increase of $32.1 million by EGID for insurance benefit 
administration, and a decrease in net position of $3.0 million by the Oklahoma Lottery Commission.  
 
The OUITF increased in net position primarily as a result of a decrease in benefit payments and claims submitted. 
 
The OWRB increased net position by $15.1 million which was $4.1 million more than the $11.0 million in the prior year. 
  
The EGID increased net position by $32.1 million due to increases in membership and premium revenue along with a 
decrease of incurred claims. 
 
GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS 
 
The differences between the original budget and the final amended budget amounted to $125.7 million with $39.4 million 
coming from budget carryovers from fiscal year 2017. To reimburse school districts for ad valorem tax shortfalls related 
to state property, the Department of Education was transferred $92.7 million. For debt services related to repairs to the 
Capitol building, OMES was granted an additional $13.9 million in funds. In addition, the Department of Corrections was 
given $8.8 million in supplementary funding. Offsetting the additions to the budget were state wide reductions caused by 
revenue shortfalls.  
 
The difference between the final budget and the actual collections amounted to $210.9 million less than the budget. Due 
to economic factors related to the economic downturn suffered by the state, this variance was not unexpected. 
 
CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 
 
Capital Assets 
 
The state’s investment in capital assets for its governmental and business-type activities as of June 30, 2018, amounts to 
$24.3 billion, net of accumulated depreciation of $12.1 billion, leaving a net book value of $12.2 billion. This investment 
in capital assets includes land, buildings, improvements, equipment, infrastructure and construction in progress. 
Infrastructure assets are items that are normally immovable and of value only to the state, such as roads, bridges, streets 
and sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting systems, and similar items. 
 
The total increase in the state’s investment in capital assets for the current fiscal year was about 2.4% in terms of net book 
value. Actual expenditures to purchase or construct assets that are capitalized were $901.3 million for the year, a $38.3 
million (4.1%) decrease from the prior year. Most of this amount was used to construct or reconstruct roads and bridges. 
Depreciation charges for the year totaled $578.3 million. Additional information on the state’s capital assets can be found 
in Note 5 of the notes to the financial statements of this report. 
 
Debt Administration 
 
The authority of the state to incur debt is described in Article X, Section 25, of the Oklahoma Constitution. In 1987, the 
state created the Council of Bond Oversight. The Council meets to review all proposed debt issuances. The Council must 
approve each financing plan before obligations are issued. The legislation that created the Council of Bond Oversight also 
created the position of State Bond Advisor, who advises the Council and must approve the pricing and fees associated 
with any debt issuance. 
 
General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the state, including the state's power to levy additional 
taxes to ensure repayment of the debt. Accordingly, all general obligation debt currently outstanding was approved by a 
vote of the citizens. The general obligation bonds of the state are rated "Aa2" by Moody's Investors Service, "AA" by 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 39 

Fitch Investors Service, and "AA" by Standard & Poor’s Corp. Before a 1993 general obligation bond program, except for 
refunding bonds, the state last issued general obligation bonds in 1968. Certain maturities of those bonds were advance 
refunded in 1977, 2003, 2011 and again in 2013.  
 
The State of Oklahoma’s total debt decreased by $53.9 million, or 3.9%, during the current fiscal year. Business-type 
activities’ debt increased by $51.2 million or 5.9%.  
 
Additional information on the state’s long-term debt obligations can be found in Notes 9, 10, and 11 of the notes to the 
financial statements of this report.  
 
ECONOMIC FACTORS AND NEXT YEAR'S BUDGETS AND RATES 
 
The Oklahoma unemployment rate was consistently lower than that for the nation between 1997 and 2017. The national 
unemployment rate is currently 3.7% while Oklahoma’s at 3.4% for the same time period.  
 
Inflationary trends in the region continue to compare favorably to national indices. 
 
These factors are considered by legislative leaders and management in preparing the state’s budget for future years. (See 
below.) 
 
Budget and Revenue Collections 
 
The State Constitution requires adoption of a balanced budget. The revenue certification provided by the State Board of 
Equalization is the basis for development of the state's General Revenue Fund (GRF) budget. The GRF is a budgetary 
cash account included in the state’s general fund. 
 
If new laws or changes in existing laws are passed that affect revenues, the Equalization Board meets to certify the effects 
of these changes on the official estimate. Appropriations in any fiscal year may not exceed 95% of the official revenue 
estimate (plus any cash funds on-hand and available for appropriation). 
 
If collections to a certified cash account are insufficient to cover the appropriations from that account, the Constitution 
requires that appropriations be reduced proportionately to all agencies receiving an appropriation from that source. OMES 
has the statutory duty to monitor revenue collections and, if warranted, to make reductions in appropriations to prevent 
deficit spending. 
 
The Legislature may, in regular or special session, make selective reductions in spending or consider revenue increases. 
 
Fiscal Year 2019 
 
General revenue fund collections have shown signs of improvement through the first five months of fiscal year 2019. 
Total collections exceeded prior year collections by 19.2% and budgeted estimates by 2% during October of 2018. This 
was driven by increased revenue from individual income tax, sales tax, motor vehicle tax, and gross production taxes. 
 
“Most reporting categories look to be on stable footing with gross production and the other revenues category falling 
short of their estimates in October” said OMES Director Denise Northrup. “I’m encouraged to see individual income tax 
returns trending up. Solid returns in this category indicate businesses are expecting a healthy economy going into the 
holiday season.”

OKLAHOMA ♦ 53 

Reconciliation of the Governmental Funds Balance Sheet to the Statement of Net Position 
 

 

Total Fund Balance - Governmental Funds $ 7,342,916

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of
net position are different because:

Capital assets used in governmental activities are not financial resources
and therefore are not reported in the funds.  These assets consist of:

                                                 Land 1,837,263
                                                 Buildings and Improvements 1,635,454
                                                 Equipment 569,832
                                                 Infrastructure 20,016,546
                                                 Construction in Progress 237,326
                                                 Accumulated Depreciation (12,083,525)

12,212,896

Some of the state's revenues will be collected after year-end but are not
available soon enough to pay for the current period's expenditures and
therefore are considered to be unearned. 116,101

(191,366)

(168,278)

Certain bonds issued by the state are for the purpose of refunding older
bond issues.  Some bonds that are refunded are done so at a loss to the 
state.  These losses are costs in the funds, but are amortized over
the life of the refunding bonds on the statement of net position. 840

Timing differences caused by the component units with alternative year end
dates resulted in differences in due to/from other funds. (37)

Some liabilities are not due and payable in the current period and therefore
are not reported in the funds.  Those liabilities consist of:

                                                Notes Payable (69,995)
                                                General Obligation and Revenue Bonds (1,163,697)
                                                Capital Leases and Certificates of Participation (1,362)
                                                Bond Issue Premiums (98,099)
                                                Accrued Interest on Bonds (24,888)
                                                Compensated Absences (158,017)
                                                Claims and Judgments (70,685)

(1,586,743)

OKLAHOMA ♦ 54



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 55 

Reconciliation of the Governmental Funds Schedule of Revenues, Expenditures  
and Changes in Fund Balances to the Statement of Activities 

 

 

Net Change in Fund Balances - Total Governmental Funds $ 602,122

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of
activities are different because:

Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures.  However,
in the statements of activities, the cost of those assets is allocated over
their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense.  This is the amount
by which capital outlays ($882,020) exceeded depreciation ($577,530)
in the current period. 304,490

In the statement of activities, only the gain on the sale of assets is
reported, whereas in the governmental funds, the proceeds from the
sale increase financial resources.  Thus, the change in net position
differs from the change in fund balance by the cost of the asset sold. (12,593)

Revenues in the statement of activities that do not provide current financial
resources are not reported as revenues in the funds. (9,958)

Bond proceeds provide current financial resources to governmental funds,
but issuing debt increases long-term liabilities in the statement of net position.
Repayment of bond principal is an expenditure in the governmental funds,
but the repayment reduces long-term liabilities in the statement of net position.
This is the amount by which bond payments ($138,894) exceeded
proceeds ($88,720). 50,174

Bond issuance premiums and discounts are other financing sources or uses
to governmental funds, but are deferred liabilities in the statement of net position.
This is the amount of bond issue premiums. (10,023)

15,918

The amount by which the state's portion of net other postemployment benefit asset 
($649) increased, net other postemployment benefit liability ($25,074) decreased, 
deferred inflows from other postemployment benefits ($25,737) increased, and 
deferred outflows from other postemployment benefits ($33,383) increased 
compared to the prior fiscal year. 33,369

1,378

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the use
of current financial resources and therefore are not reported as expenditures
in the governmental funds. 

          Accretion of bond premiums 12,360
          Increase in entity-wide interest payable                2,652
          Decrease in compensated absences                      245
          Amortization of losses on refunded bonds (686)
          Timing difference of due from/to other funds 51
          Decrease in claims and judgments payable          (3,902)

10,720

Change in Net Position of Governmental Activities $ 985,597

The Notes to the Financial Statements are an integral part of this statement.

The amount by which the state's portion of net pension asset ($18,207) increased,
net pension liability ($385,287) decreased, deferred inflows from pensions ($218,614)
decreased, and deferred outflows from pensions ($606,190) decreased compared to
the prior fiscal year.

For assets acquired as capital leases, the amount financed is reported in the 
governmental funds as a source of financing.  However, capital leases are long-term 
liabilities in the statement of net position.  This is the amount by which the payment 
of principal ($1,378) exceeded the addition of new capital leases ($0).

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 
 
 

Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The accompanying financial statements of the State of Oklahoma (the “state”) are prepared in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). 
 
In June of 2015, GASB issued Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other 
Than Pensions.  This statement addresses accounting and financial reporting for Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) 
that are provided to the employees of the state and local governmental employers and establishes standards for 
recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows of resources, deferred inflows of resources and 
expense/expenditures. For defined benefit OPEB, this Statement identifies the methods and assumptions that are required 
to be used to project benefit payments, discount projected benefit payments to their actuarial present value and attribute 
that present value to periods of employee service. Note disclosures and required supplementary information requirements 
about defined benefit OPEB also are addressed.  The adoption of this standard had a significant impact on the financial 
statements. 
 
The state was required to implement this standard for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
In March of 2016, GASB issued Statement No. 81, Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements.  This statement requires that a 
government that receives resources pursuant to an irrevocable split-interest agreement recognize assets, liabilities, and 
deferred inflows of resources at the inception of the agreement. Furthermore, the statement requires that a government 
recognize assets representing its beneficial interests in irrevocable split-interest agreements that are administered by a 
third party, if the government controls the present service capacity of the beneficial interests. This statement also requires 
that a government recognize revenue when the resources become applicable to the reporting period.  The adoption of this 
standard did not have a significant impact on the financial statements. 
 
The state was required to implement this standard for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
In March of 2017, GASB issued Statement No. 85, Omnibus 2017.  This statement addresses practice issues that were 
identified during implementation and application of certain GASB statements including blending component units, 
goodwill, fair value measurement and application, and postemployment benefits.  The adoption of this standard did not 
have a significant impact on the financial statements. 
 
The state was required to implement this standard for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
In May of 2017, GASB issued Statement No. 86, Certain Debt Extinguishment Issues.  This statement improves 
accounting and financial reporting for in-substance defeasance of debt by providing guidance for transactions in which 
cash and other monetary assets acquired only with existing resources are placed in an irrevocable trust for the sole 
purpose of extinguishing debt.  The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the financial statements. 
 
The state was required to implement this standard for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
New Accounting Pronouncements Issues Not Yet Adopted: 
 
GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations, establishes criteria for determining the timing and pattern 
of recognition of a liability and corresponding deferred outflow of resources for asset retirement obligations.  
 
GASB Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities, establishes criteria for identifying fiduciary activities of all state and local 
governments.  The focus of the criteria is on whether a government is controlling the assets of the fiduciary activity and 
the beneficiaries with whom a fiduciary relationship exists. 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 70 

 
GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that previously were 
classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows or outflows of resources based on the payment provisions of the 
contracts.  The statement also establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that 
leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset.  The lessee is required to recognize a lease liability and an 
intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of 
resources. 
 
GASB Statement No. 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, including Direct Borrowings and Direct Placements, 
improves the information disclosed in notes to the financial statements related to debt, including direct borrowings and 
direct placements.  The statement also clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information 
related to debt. 
 
GASB Statement No. 89, Accounting for Interest Cost Incurred before the End of a Construction Period, enhances the 
relevance and comparability of information about capital assets and the cost of borrowing for a reporting period and 
simplifies accounting for interest cost incurred before the end of the construction period. 
 
The accompanying financial statements present the financial position of the state and the various funds and fund types, 
the results of operations of the state and the various funds and fund types, and the cash flows of the proprietary funds.  
The financial statements are presented as of June 30, 2018, and for the year then ended. The financial statements include 
the various agencies, boards, commissions, public trusts, authorities and other organizational units governed by the 
Oklahoma State Legislature and/or Constitutional Officers of the State of Oklahoma. 
 

A. Reporting Entity 
 
The state has considered all potential component units for which it is financially accountable and other organizations for 
which the nature and significance of their relationship with the state are such that exclusion would cause the state's 
financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The Governmental Accounting Standards Board has set forth criteria 
to be considered in determining financial accountability. These criteria include appointing a voting majority of an 
organization's governing body and (1) the ability of the state to impose its will on that organization or (2) the potential for 
the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on, the state. Local school 
districts (the state's support of the public education system is reported in the general fund) and other local authorities of 
various kinds that may meet only one of the criteria for inclusion in this report have not been included. 
     

 As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), these financial statements present the State of 
Oklahoma (the primary government) and its component units. 

 
 Discretely Presented Component Units 

 
Component units are entities which are legally separate from the state, but are financially accountable to the state, or 
whose relationships with the state are such that exclusion would cause the state's financial statements to be misleading or 
incomplete. Separately issued independent audit reports may be obtained from the Office of Management and Enterprise 
Services, 5005 North Lincoln Blvd., Suite 100, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73105. The audit reports may also be obtained 
from the respective component units at the addresses presented on the description page of the fund financial statements 
section for the major component units, and the description page in the Combining Financial Statement section of this 
report for the non-major component units. 
 
 
The component units columns of the government-wide financial statements include the financial data of the following 
entities: 
  



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 71 

 
MAJOR COMPONENT UNITS 

 
Oklahoma Student Loan Authority provides loan funds to qualified persons at participating educational 
institutions through the issuance of tax-exempt revenue bonds or other debt obligations. The Authority is 
composed of five members appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate.  The state 
can impose its will on the authority by its ability to veto or modify the Authority’s decisions. The Authority 
was audited by other independent auditors for the year ended June 30, 2018, and their report, dated 
November 1, 2018, was previously issued under separate cover. 
 
Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency is authorized to issue revenue bonds and notes in order to provide 
funds to promote the development of residential housing and other economic development for the benefit of 
citizens. In addition, the agency administers Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments programs for the 
United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. The Board of Trustees consists of five 
members appointed by the governor. The state can impose its will on the Agency by its ability to veto or 
modify the Agency’s decisions. The Agency was audited by other independent auditors for the year ended 
September 30, 2017, and their report, dated January 11, 2018, was previously issued under separate cover. 
 
Oklahoma Turnpike Authority constructs, maintains, repairs, and operates turnpike projects at locations 
authorized by the Legislature and approved by the State Department of Transportation. The Authority 
receives its revenues from turnpike tolls and a percentage of turnpike concession sales. The Authority issues 
revenue bonds to finance turnpike projects. The Authority consists of the governor and six members 
appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The state can impose its will on the 
Authority by its ability to veto or modify the Authority’s decisions. The Authority was audited by other 
independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2017, and their report, dated March 29, 2018, was 
previously issued under separate cover. 
 
Grand River Dam Authority controls the waters of the Grand River system to develop and generate water 
power and electric energy, and to promote irrigation, conservation and development of natural resources.  
The Authority produces and distributes electrical power for sale to customers primarily located in 
northeastern Oklahoma. The customers consist of rural electric cooperatives, municipalities, industries and 
off-system sales. The seven member Board of Directors consists of the general manager of the Oklahoma 
Association of Electric Cooperatives, the executive director of the Municipal Electric Systems of Oklahoma, 
and appointees by the governor, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the president pro tempore 
of the Senate. The state can impose its will on the Authority by its ability to veto or modify the Authority’s 
decisions. The Authority was audited by other independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2017, 
and their report, dated March 31, 2018, was previously issued under separate cover. 
 
Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority provides a means for the municipal electric systems in the state to 
jointly plan, finance, acquire, and operate electrical power supply facilities. Facilities are financed through 
the issuance of revenue bonds, which are approved by the state's Bond Oversight Commission. Exclusion of 
the Component Unit would cause the state's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The 
Authority was audited by other independent auditors for the year ended December 31, 2017, and their report, 
dated March 30, 2018, was previously issued under separate cover. 
 
Higher Education Component Unit - This component unit is primarily comprised of the 25 colleges and 
universities that are members of the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education (the System). All of the 
colleges and universities have foundations that receive and hold economic resources for the benefit of their 
associated entity. These foundations are component units of their respective college or university and are 
included as part of the Higher Education Component Unit. Separately issued independent audit reports for 
each college, university, foundation, or other included entity may be obtained from the Office of Management 
and Enterprise Services, 5005 North Lincoln Blvd., Suite 100, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73105. Each 
institution in the System is governed by a Board of Regents. The Boards of Regents consist of five to ten

Related Organizations and Related Parties 
 
Organizations, for which a primary government is accountable because the state appoints a voting majority of the board, 
but is not financially accountable, are considered to be related organizations. The Oklahoma Ordnance Works Authority 
(OOWA) is a related organization of the state.  The state appoints a voting majority of the Trustees of OOWA but has no 
further accountability.   

B. Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 
 
The government-wide financial statements (the statement of net position and the statement of activities) report 
information for all of the non-fiduciary activities of the primary government and its component units. For the most part, 
the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these government-wide statements. Governmental activities, which 
normally are supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type activities, 
which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported 
separately from the legally separate component units for which the primary government is financially accountable. 
 
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given function, segment, or 
component unit are offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific 
function, segment, or component unit. Program revenues include charges to customers who purchase, use or directly 
benefit from goods or services provided by a given function, segment, or component unit. Program revenues also include 
grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular function, 
segment, or component unit. Taxes and other items not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as 
general revenues. Resources that are dedicated internally are reported as general revenues rather than as program 
revenues. The state does not allocate general government (indirect) expenses to other functions. 
 
Net position is restricted when constraints placed on it are either externally imposed or are imposed by constitutional 
provisions or enabling legislation. Internally imposed designations of resources are not presented as restricted net 
position. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, generally it is the state’s policy to use 
restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed.  
 
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar 
component units, and major component units. However, the fiduciary funds are not included in the government-wide 
statements. Major individual governmental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate columns 
in the fund financial statements. 

C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Financial Statement Presentation 
 
Government-Wide Financial Statements – The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic 
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are 
recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Grants and similar items are 
recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by the provider are met. Interfund services provided 
and used are not eliminated in the process of consolidation. 
 
Governmental Fund Financial Statements – The governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current 
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as 
they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered available when they are collectible within the current 
period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the state considers revenues 
available if they are collected within sixty days of the end of the current fiscal year end. Principal revenue sources 
considered susceptible to accrual include federal grants, interest on investments, sales and income taxes, and lease 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 76 

payments receivable. Some revenue items that are considered measurable and available to finance operations during the 
year from an accounting perspective are not available for expenditure due to the state's present appropriation system.  
These revenues are accrued in accordance with GAAP since they are earned and expected to be collected within sixty 
days of the end of the period. Other revenues are considered measurable and available only when cash is received by the 
state. 
 
Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. Modifications to the accrual 
basis of accounting include:  
 
- Employees' vested annual leave is recorded as an expenditure as it is utilized. Unused reimbursable leave following 

an employee’s resignation or retirement that is unpaid at year end is recognized as an expenditure and a liability of 
the fund. 

- Interest on general long-term obligations is recognized when paid. 
- Executory purchase orders and contracts are recorded as a commitment of fund balance. 
- Debt service expenditures and claims and judgments are recorded only when payment is due. 
 
Proprietary Funds, Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units, and Component Units Financial Statements – 
The financial statements of the proprietary funds, fiduciary funds and similar component units, and component units are 
reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, similar to the government-
wide statements described above. 
 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and 
expenses generally result from providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary 
fund’s principal ongoing operations. Revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as nonoperating 
revenues and expenses. The principal operating revenues of the state’s enterprise funds are requisitioned from the 
Oklahoma Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund held by the U.S. Treasury for payment of unemployment benefits,   
monthly premiums for self-funded insurance benefits provided to statutorily defined state employees by the Employees 
Group Insurance Division, interest revenue charges for loans made to local entities by the Oklahoma Water Resources 
Board (OWRB), and the sale of lottery tickets and related chance games by the Lottery Commission. The OWRB reports 
federal grants as both operating and nonoperating, depending on the types of grants received.  

D. Fund Accounting 
 
The financial activities of the state are recorded in individual funds, each of which is deemed to be a separate accounting 
entity. The state uses fund accounting to report on its financial position and results of operations. Fund accounting is 
designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial management by segregating transactions related to certain 
government functions or activities. A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  
 
The financial activities of the state that are reported in the accompanying financial statements are classified into the 
following major governmental and proprietary funds. In addition, a description of the fiduciary and component units 
follows:   

1. Governmental Funds 
 
General Fund - This fund accounts for all activities of the state not specifically required to be accounted for in other 
funds. Included are transactions for services such as education, general government, health services, legal and judiciary, 
museums, natural resources, public safety and defense, regulatory services, social services, and transportation. Debt 
service transactions and related cash balances are reported in the general fund with balances held to service imminent debt 
activity presented as a component of restricted fund balance. 
 
Commissioners of the Land Office Permanent Fund – This fund accounts for the land and cash granted to the state by 
the United States Congress for the use and benefit of educational systems in Oklahoma. This fund’s assets are held by the 
state and only the income derived from the principal may be expended for designated operations. The principal must be 
preserved intact.  
 
Department of Wildlife Conservation Permanent Fund – This fund accounts for moneys held in trust for the 
improvement and preservation of wildlife. The moneys accumulate from the sale of lifetime hunting and fishing licenses. 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 77 

This fund’s assets are held by the state and only the income derived from the principal may be expended for designated 
operations.  The principal must be preserved intact. 
 
Tobacco Settlement Endowment Permanent Fund – This fund accounts for certain moneys transferred from the 
general fund that were received in settlement of claims by the state against tobacco manufacturers. The earnings from 
these moneys are utilized for research, education, prevention and treatment of tobacco related diseases and certain other 
health programs. The principal must be preserved intact. 

2. Proprietary Funds 
 
These funds account for those activities for which the intent of management is to recover, primarily through user charges, 
the cost of providing goods or services to the general public, or where sound financial management dictates that periodic 
determinations of results of operations are appropriate. 
 
Employees Group Insurance Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services provides group 
health, life, dental, disability and other benefits to active state employees and local government employees, as well 
as varying coverages for active education employees and certain participants of the state’s retirement systems, 
survivors, and persons covered by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 or COBRA. 
Coverages are funded by monthly premiums paid by employers and employees.   
 
Employment Security Commission Enterprise Fund - This fund accounts for the deposit of moneys requisitioned from 
the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund held by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for payment of unemployment 
benefits and administrative costs. 
 
Oklahoma Water Resources Board Enterprise Fund - This fund is comprised of Oklahoma Water Resources Board 
and the Department of Environmental Quality bond issues and revolving loan programs. These programs make loans to 
local government units for the acquisition, development, and utilization of storage and control facilities for water and 
sewage systems. 
 
Oklahoma Lottery Commission Enterprise Fund – This fund operates the statewide lottery program and related 
chance games, seeking to generate additional revenues for the benefit of the state’s educational system.   

3. Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 
 
The state presents as fiduciary funds those activities that account for assets held in a trustee capacity or as an agent for 
individuals, private organizations or other governmental units. 
 
Pension Trust Funds - These funds account for the transactions, assets, liabilities, and net position of the Wildlife 
Conservation Retirement Plan in the primary government, and six Public Employee Retirement Systems (PERS) that 
meet the definition of a component unit of the state. 
 
Agency Funds - These funds account for the assets held, primarily taxes collected, for distribution by the state as an 
agent for other governmental units, other organizations or individuals. 

4. Component Units 
 
These entities are legally separate from the state but are considered part of the reporting entity. These funds meet the 
definition of both a component unit and that of an enterprise fund as previously described. The six public employee 
retirement systems meet the definition of a component unit, but are presented with the other fiduciary funds of the state. 
  



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 78 

5. Financial Statement Reporting Periods 
 
The accompanying financial statements of the state are presented as of June 30, 2018, and for the year then ended, except 
for the following funds and entities which were audited by other independent auditors:   
 
 Multiple Injury Trust Fund 12-31-17 
 Employees Group Insurance Division  12-31-17 
 Oklahoma Turnpike Authority 12-31-17 
 Grand River Dam Authority 12-31-17 
 Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority 12-31-17 
 Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency 09-30-17 

E. Budgeting and Budgetary Control 
 
The state's annual budget is prepared on the cash basis utilizing encumbrance accounting. Encumbrances represent 
executed but unperformed purchase orders. In the accompanying financial statements, encumbrances are recorded as 
expenditures for budgetary purposes if expected to be presented for payment by November 15 following the end of the 
fiscal year and as a component of either restricted or committed fund balance for GAAP purposes. Since the budgetary 
basis differs from GAAP, budget and actual amounts in the accompanying Required Supplementary Information – 
Budgetary Schedules are presented on the budgetary basis. A reconciliation of revenues in excess of (less than) 
expenditures and other financing sources (uses) on a budgetary basis at June 30, 2018, to revenues in excess of (less than) 
expenditures and other financing sources (uses) presented in conformity with GAAP is set forth in the Notes to Required 
Supplementary Information. 
 
The governor prepares and submits to the Legislature at the beginning of each annual legislative session a balanced 
budget based on budget requests prepared by the various state agencies. The general fund is the only fund for which an 
annual budget is legally adopted. Budgeted expenditures cannot exceed the amount available for appropriation as certified 
by the State Board of Equalization. The Legislature may modify the governor's proposed budget as it deems necessary 
and legally enacts an annual state budget through the passage of appropriation bills. The governor has the power to 
approve or veto each line item appropriation. 
 
The legal level of budgetary control is maintained at the line item level (i.e., general operations, duties, etc.) identified in 
the appropriation acts. Budgets may be modified subject to statutory limits on transfers. The Secretary of Finance, 
Administration, and Information Technology can approve transfers of up to 25% between line items. The Contingency 
Review Board (a three-member board comprised of the governor, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and the speaker 
of the House of Representatives) can approve transfers between line items of up to 40%. All transfers are subject to 
review by the Joint Legislative Committee on Budget and Program Oversight to determine if the transfer tends to 
effectuate or subvert the intention and objectives of the Legislature. 
 
Current policy allows agencies to use unexpended moneys for one-time purchases or non-recurring expenditures in the 
next fiscal year. This policy provides an incentive for agency managers to distribute resources efficiently; however, it is 
subject to annual approval by the Legislature. Unexpended balances not carried forward to the new fiscal year by 
November 15 may: 1) lapse to unrestricted balances and be available for future appropriation, 2) lapse to restricted 
balances and be available for future appropriations restricted for specific purposes as defined by statute, or 3) be non-
fiscal, and may be spent from one to thirty months from the date of appropriation. 
 
If funding sources are not sufficient to cover appropriations, the Secretary of Finance, Administration, and Information 
Technology is required to reduce the budget by the amount of such deficiency. Any other changes to the budget must be 
approved by the Legislature in a supplemental appropriation. All fiscal year 2018 appropriated line items were within 
their authorized spending level. 

F. Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The state uses a pooled cash concept in maintaining its bank accounts. All cash is pooled for operating and investment 
purposes and each fund has relative equity in the pooled amount. For reporting purposes, cash and related time deposits 
are allocated to each fund based on its equity in the pooled amount. Interest earned on investments is allocated to the 
general fund except for those investments made specifically for the proprietary fund type, fiduciary fund type, proprietary 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 79 

component units, and Higher Education Component Unit, for each of which investment revenue is allocated to the 
investing fund.  

 
The State Treasurer requires that financial institutions deposit collateral securities to secure the deposits of the state in 
each such institution. The State Treasurer also promulgates all rules and regulations regarding the amount of collateral 
securities that must be pledged to secure public deposits.   
 
The Oklahoma Employment Security Commission Trust Fund is maintained to account for the collection of 
unemployment contributions from employers and the payment of unemployment benefits to eligible claimants. As 
required by federal law, all resources not necessary for current benefit payments are placed on deposit with the U.S. 
Treasury. Interest from these resources is retained in the fund. 
 
For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments with a 
maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to cash.  

G. Investments 
 
Investments, which may be restricted by law or legal instruments, are under control of either the State Treasurer or other 
administrative bodies as determined by law. 
 
Generally accepted accounting principles establish a fair value hierarchy for the determination and measurement of fair 
value. This hierarchy is based on the type of valuation inputs needed to measure the fair value of an asset. The hierarchy 
generally is as follows: 
 

1. Level 1  — Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
2. Level 2  — Quoted prices for similar assets, or inputs that are observable or other forms of market 

corroborated inputs 
3. Level 3  — Pricing based on best available information, including primarily unobservable inputs and 

assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset 

H. Receivables 
 
Accounts receivable in all funds report amounts that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and are stated net of 
allowances for uncollectible amounts. 
 
Governmental fund type receivables consist primarily of amounts due from the federal government. Interest and 
investment revenue receivable in all funds consist of revenues due on each investment. Taxes receivable in governmental 
funds represent taxes subject to accrual, primarily income taxes and sales taxes, which are collected within sixty days 
after fiscal year end. Lease payments receivable in the general fund consists primarily of capital lease payments due for 
equipment and railroad lines owned by the Department of Transportation. Collectability of these lease payments is 
reasonably assured and no allowance for uncollectible amounts has been established. 
 
Taxes receivable in enterprise funds represents unemployment taxes due at year end, net of an allowance for uncollectible 
amounts. The uncollectible amounts are based on collection experience and a review of the status of existing receivables. 

I. Inter/Intrafund Transactions 
 

 Interfund Transactions - The state has two types of interfund transactions: 
 
- Services rendered transactions are accounted for as revenues and expenditures or expenses in the funds involved. 
- Operating appropriations/subsidies are accounted for as transfers in the funds involved. 
 
Intrafund Transactions - Intrafund transfers, as a result of contracts among departments and/or agencies within the same 
fund, are considered expenditures by the contractor and revenues by the contractee for budgetary purposes. The Required 
Supplementary Information – Budgetary Schedules section includes these transactions. However, as a general rule 
recorded intrafund revenues and expenditures are eliminated in the GAAP-basis government-wide financial statements. A 
portion of motor fuel excise taxes collected on fuels consumed on the state's turnpikes is made available to the Oklahoma 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 80 

Turnpike Authority (OTA) from the Oklahoma Tax Commission. These taxes are apportioned to OTA monthly to fund 
debt service, but only to the extent amounts are not otherwise available to OTA. If the motor fuel excise taxes apportioned 
to OTA are not needed in the month of apportionment, the taxes are transferred to the Department of Transportation 
(DOT). Before these monthly transfers were mandated, a balance owed to DOT had accumulated and at fiscal year-end, 
this balance is presented as a noncurrent Due to Other Funds on the financial statements of OTA. 

J. Inventories and Prepaid Expenses 
 
Inventories of materials and supplies are determined both by physical counts and through perpetual inventory systems.  
Generally, inventories are valued at cost and predominantly on either the first-in first-out or weighted average basis.  
Inventories of federal surplus properties are valued at a percentage of federal acquisition cost. General fund inventories 
are recorded as expenditures when consumed rather than when purchased by recording adjustments to the inventory 
account on the balance sheet. The general fund inventories on hand at year-end are reflected as a component of 
nonspendable fund balance on the balance sheet, except for $455,000 in food commodities which is recorded as inventory 
and deferred revenue. Upon distribution, the food commodities are recognized as revenues and expenditures of the 
general fund. 
 
The value of the inventory of food commodities in the general fund is calculated by using a weighted average cost based 
on the U.S. Department of Agriculture commodity price list at the inventory receipt date. The value of the inventory of 
food stamps in the general fund is valued at coupon value.  
 
Higher Education Component Unit inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined on 
either the first-in first-out or average cost basis. 
 
Prepaid expenses are recorded using the “purchases method,” meaning that they are initially recorded as expenditures. At 
fiscal year-end, significant amounts of prepaid expenditures are shown as a component of nonspendable fund balance, 
indicating they do not constitute available expendable resources. 

K. Capital Assets 
 
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure assets (which are normally immovable and of 
value only to the state, such as roads, bridges, streets and sidewalks, drainage systems, lighting systems, and similar 
items), are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial 
statements. Capital assets are defined by the state as assets which have a cost of $25,000 or more at the date of acquisition 
and have an expected useful life of five or more years. Purchased and constructed capital assets are valued at historical 
cost or estimated historical cost. Donated capital assets are recorded at their fair market value at the date of donation, 
unless received as part of a service concession arrangement at which point they would be recorded at acquisition cost.    
 
The estimates of historical costs of buildings and other improvements were based on appraised value, as of August 4, 
1994, indexed to the date of acquisition. Infrastructure constructed prior to July 1, 2000, was recorded at estimated 
historical cost. The estimated historical cost for years 1916-2000 was based on capital outlay expenditures reported by 
DOT and the Federal Highway Administration, less an amount estimated for the historical cost of the acquisition of land 
for right-of-way. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the asset's value or materially extend an 
asset's useful life are not capitalized. Interest incurred during construction of capital facilities is not capitalized. 
 
Capital assets utilized in the governmental funds are recorded as expenditures in the governmental fund financial 
statements. Depreciation expense is recorded in the government-wide financial statements, as well as the proprietary 
funds and component unit’s financial statements. Capital assets received in a service concession arrangement are reported 
at acquisition, rather than fair value. 
 
  



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 81 

Capital assets of the primary government and the component units are depreciated on the straight-line method over the 
assets' estimated useful life. There is no depreciation recorded for land and construction in progress. Generally, estimated 
useful lives are as follows: 
 
 Machinery and equipment 3 - 20 years 
 Buildings and other improvements 7 - 60 years 
 Infrastructure 30 years 
 
Collections and works of art are not included in capital assets of the primary government on the statement of net position. 
GASB Statement No. 34 does not require capitalization of collections if they meet all of the following criteria: held for 
public exhibition, education, or research in furtherance of service, rather than financial gain; protected, kept 
unencumbered, cared for, and preserved; and subject to an organizational policy that requires the proceeds from sales of 
collection items to be used to acquire other items for collections. The state elected not to capitalize collections and works 
of art since they meet all of the above conditions. 

L. Other Assets 
 
Included in other assets (noncurrent for component units) are costs to be recovered from future revenues. Certain items 
included in the operating costs of the Grand River Dam Authority, an unregulated enterprise, are recovered through rates 
set by the Board of Directors. Recognition of these costs, primarily depreciation on debt funded capital assets, 
amortization of debt discount and expense, and amortization of losses on advance refunding of long-term debt, is deferred 
to the extent that such costs will be included in rates charged in future years. The Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority 
(OMPA) enters into power sales contracts with participating municipalities that provide for billings to those 
municipalities for output and services of the projects. Revenues from these contracts provide for payment of current 
operating and maintenance expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization), as well as payment of scheduled debt 
principal and interest, and deposits into certain funds as prescribed in the bond resolutions. For financial reporting 
purposes, OMPA currently recognizes depreciation of assets financed by bond principal and amortization expense. The 
difference between current operating expenses and the amounts currently billed under the terms of the power sales 
contracts are delayed to future periods in which these amounts will be recovered through revenues. 

M. Unearned Revenue 
 
Unearned revenues at the fund level arise when potential revenue does not meet the available criterion for recognition in 
the current period. Available is defined as due (or past due) at June 30, and collected within sixty days thereafter to pay 
obligations due at June 30. Unearned revenues also arise when resources are received by the state before it has a legal 
claim to them. In subsequent periods, when the revenue recognition criterion is met, or when the state has a legal claim to 
the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is removed from the combined statement of net position, and revenue is 
recognized. Unearned revenues at the government-wide level arise only when the state receives resources before it has a 
legal claim to them. Also included in unearned revenue at both levels are the undistributed food commodity inventories. 

N. Compensated Absences 
 
Employees earn annual vacation leave at the average rate of 10 hours per month for the first 5 years of service, 12 hours 
per month for service of 5 to 10 years, 13.33 hours per month for service of 10 to 20 years, and 16.67 hours per month for 
over 20 years of service. Unused annual leave may be accumulated to a maximum of 240 hours for employees with less 
than 5 years of continuous service or 480 hours for employees with 5 years or more of continuous service. All accrued 
annual leave is payable upon termination, resignation, retirement, or death. The governmental fund financial statements 
record expenditures when employees are paid for leave. The government-wide financial statements present the cost of 
accumulated vacation leave as a liability. The liability is valued based on current rate of pay. There is no liability for 
unpaid accumulated sick leave since the state does not have a policy to pay this amount when employees separate from 
service. 

O. Risk Management 
 
The Risk Management Department of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services is responsible for the acquisition 
and administration of all insurance purchased by the state, or administration of any self-insurance plans and programs 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 82 

adopted for use by the state or for certain organizations and bodies outside of state government, at the sole expense of 
such organizations and bodies. 
 
The Risk Management Department is authorized to settle claims of the state and oversee the dispensation and/or 
settlement of claims against a state political subdivision. In no event shall self-insurance coverage exceed the limitations 
on the maximum dollar amount of liability specified by the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act. The Risk 
Management Department oversees the collection of liability claims owed to the state incurred as the result of a loss 
through the wrongful or negligent act of a private person or other entity. 
 
The Risk Management Department is also charged with the responsibility to immediately notify the Attorney General of 
any claims against the state presented to Risk Management. 

P. Federal Grants 
 
In addition to monetary transactions, federal grants also include non-monetary transactions for surplus inventory, food 
stamps, food, and other commodities. Surplus inventory is valued at a percentage of government acquisition cost. Food 
stamps are valued at coupon value. Commodities are valued at their federally reported value in the general fund. 

Q. Long-Term Obligations   
 
Premiums, Discounts and Issuance Costs – In the government-wide financial statements, long-term debt and other 
long-term obligations are presented in the columns for governmental and business-type activities. The same is presented 
in the proprietary fund financial statements. Bond and note premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, are 
deferred and amortized over the life of the debt. Bonds and notes payable are reported net of the applicable bond premium 
or discount. Bond issuance costs are reported in the period incurred.  
 
In the governmental fund financial statements, governmental funds recognize bond premiums and discounts, as well as 
bond issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of debt issued is reported as other financing sources.  
Premiums received on debt issuance are reported as other financing sources while discounts are reported as other 
financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as 
expenditures in the period incurred. 
 
Arbitrage Rebate Liability – The enterprise funds and component units account for any arbitrage rebate payable as a 
liability of the fund. 

R. Governmental Fund – Fund Balance  
  
 The governmental fund financial statements present fund balance at the aggregate level of detail within the categories 

defined by GASB Statement 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions. Refer to Note 12 for 
further discussion.  

S. Deficit Fund Balance – Multiple Injury Trust Fund/Oklahoma Capital Investment Board 
 

 The Multiple Injury Trust Fund (MITF), a component unit, continues to operate in a deficit situation. MITF had total net 
liabilities (negative net position) of $462,493,000 at December 31, 2017. Legislation was passed in May 2000 providing 
new funding for MITF through an assessment on gross premiums on workers compensation policies written by insurance 
carriers and an assessment on disability awards paid by self-insured employers, and further limits future awards against 
MITF to claimants that timely filed injury claims that occurred before June 1, 2000, against their employer. These 
claimants have no time limitation for filing against MITF. No new claims related to injuries subsequent to June 1, 2000, 
can be filed. Funding is to continue until the Workers’ Compensation Commission has certified that there are sufficient 
funds to satisfy all outstanding obligations of MITF. 
 
The Oklahoma Capital Investment Board (OCIB), a component unit, operated at a deficit for the fiscal year. In fiscal year 
2006, the OCIB purchased 100% of the ownership of the Oklahoma Capital Formation Company LLC (OCFC), a 
formerly blended entity. This purchase brought on the long-term liabilities of the OCFC, and as a result, puts the OCIB in 
a negative net asset position. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the OCIB had negative net position of $997,000. 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 83 

The OCIB takes a long-term approach to economic stimulation, and it is anticipated that a negative net position balance 
could persist well into the future.  

T. Pollution Remediation Obligations 
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, it was determined that several agencies incurred expenses of $483,000 for 
pollution obligations related to hazardous material on highways and asbestos removal, where clean-up is generally 
required to comply with federal regulations. This type of remediation is generally a control obligation performed as part 
of current operations during road construction or building renovation. There was also a liability incurred of $1,646,000 
which is included in accounts payable on the government-wide financial statements. 
 
Pollution remediation obligation is determined by the agency responsible for performing the remediation. These estimates 
are subject to revision because of price increases or reductions, changes in technology, or changes in applicable laws or 
regulations. There are currently no expectations of cost recoveries from ongoing projects. 
 

Note 2.  Deposits and Investments 
 
The State Treasurer maintains two investment portfolios. The treasurer’s portfolio is used to manage the investments of 
all state moneys that are under the control of the treasurer where earnings accrue to the general fund of the state. The state 
agency portfolio is used for the investment of a limited number of state agencies specifically authorized by statute to 
direct the activities of certain funds and accounts where the earnings accrue to those funds and accounts. Ancillary to the 
treasurer’s portfolio is an internal investment pool, OK INVEST, for all state funds and agencies that are considered part 
of the State of Oklahoma. All cash balances held through the State Treasurer for the primary government, Component 
Units and Fiduciary Funds earn a return through the OK INVEST pool program.  
 
In accordance with statutes, the state treasurer’s investment policy allows for investments in the following categories: 
 
United States (U.S.) Treasury Bills, Notes and Bonds   Collateralized or insured certificates of deposit 
U.S. Government Agency Securities     Negotiable certificates of deposit 
Prime Banker's acceptances      Prime commercial paper 
Investment grade obligations of state and local governments  Repurchase agreements 
Short-term bond funds      Money market funds 
Foreign bonds       
    
The State Treasurer’s investment policy attempts to reduce portfolio risk through diversification by security, institution 
and maturity. With the exception of U.S. treasury securities, no more than 50% of the state’s total funds available for 
investment are invested in a single security or with a single financial institution. In addition, the treasurer’s investments 
will not have an average maturity greater than 4 years unless otherwise specifically designated by the treasurer. The 
following table outlines the State Treasurer’s diversification limits designed to control various types of risk:

OKLAHOMA ♦ 84 

The primary government’s three permanent funds, Commissioners of the Land Office, Department of Wildlife Lifetime 
Licenses and the Tobacco Settlement Endowment all have investment goals and horizons that differ from the State 
Treasurer. Accordingly, the investment policies for the permanent funds allow for broader classes of investments as well 
as extended dates of maturity.  
 
The Employment Security Commission, Water Resources Board, Office of Management and Enterprise Services-
Employees Group Insurance Division (EGID) and Lottery Commission are the four business-type activities within the 
primary government. These agencies generally have investment policies that correlate to the operations and services that 
they perform. The Employment Security Commission generally will not invest outside of U.S. government securities and 
typically maintains deposit balances only. The Water Resources Board, EGID and Lottery Commission all operate with 
longer investment horizons, and as part of normal operations, will attempt to match maturities of investments with the 
approaching maturity of liabilities.  
 
Due to the nature of the internal investment pool, ownership of investments cannot be assigned to individual funds, 
including the pension trust funds and component units. The investment pool also holds securities purchased with cash 
collateral from securities lending, which are not assigned to individual funds. For these reasons, total investments will not 
agree to the financial statements for the primary government. The following table details the investments held by the 
primary government at June 30, 2018 (expressed in thousands): 
 

 
 
The primary government categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally 
accepted accounting principles. The primary government used the “market approach” for valuation purposes. The 
following table details the fair value of investments held by the primary government at June 30, 2018 (expressed in

Investments - Primary Government



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 85 

 
 

Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 
 
The fiduciary funds of the state have investment goals that vary significantly from the primary government. Due to the 
long term nature of these funds, investment options are broader and maturities can be longer than that of the primary 
government. These funds generally have investment policies allowing for investments in stocks, bonds, fixed income 
securities and other investment securities including commingled, mutual and index funds. Generally policies allow for a 
portion of investments to be held in securities of foreign companies and countries. Policies also allow for portions of the 
total portfolio to be held in derivatives and derivative like investments such as U.S. Treasury separate trading of 
registered interest and principal of securities (or STRIPS), collateralized mortgage obligations, convertible securities and 
variable rate instruments.  
 
The fiduciary funds categorize fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted 
accounting principles. The valuation techniques vary based upon investment type and involve a certain degree of expert 
judgment. The following table details the fair value of investments held by the fiduciary funds at June 30, 2018

Component Units 
 
The component units of the state have varied investment goals based on the demands of their specific enterprise, and 
commonly have investment policies that allow for broader asset classes and longer maturities than that of the primary 
government. Various finance authorities invest in an attempt to match targeted returns to the maturity of liabilities. The 
Higher Education Component Unit is comprised of numerous foundations that invest in order to maximize gains for the 
institutions that they support. These foundations may also hold assets of different classes as part of donor restrictions and 
covenants. The component units categorize fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by 
generally accepted accounting principles. The valuation techniques vary based upon investment type and involve a certain 
degree of expert judgment. The following table details the fair value of investments held by component units at June 30, 
2018 (expressed in thousands): 
 

 
 
A.  Custodial Credit Risk  
 
Custodial Credit Risk is the risk that in the event of the failure of the counterparty, the state will not be able to recover the 
value of its investments. Deposits are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured and uncollateralized. 
Investment securities are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured, not registered in the name of the state, or 
held by the counterparty or its trust department but not in the state’s name. 
 
Primary Government 
 
The State Treasurer requires that financial institutions deposit collateral securities to secure the deposits of the state in 
each such institution. The amount of collateral securities to be pledged for the security of public deposits is established by 
rules promulgated by the State Treasurer. In accordance with the Office of State Treasurer's policies, the collateral 
securities to be pledged by financial institutions through the State Treasurer’s Office are pledged at market value and 
must be at 110% of value to collateralize the amount on deposit, less any federal insurance coverage. All investments held 
by the State Treasurer are insured, registered, or held in the name of the State Treasurer.  
 
As of June 30, 2018, the primary government’s bank balances of deposits are fully insured or collateralized with 
securities held by an agent of the state in the state’s name. In addition to these deposits, the state has approximately 
$1,055,575,000 on deposit with the U.S. government. These funds represent unemployment insurance taxes collected 
from Oklahoma employers that are held by the U.S. treasury. The book value of deposits does not materially differ from 
the bank balance.

OKLAHOMA ♦ 87 

The pension trust funds, fiduciary component units of the state, have investment policies that do not specifically address 
custodial credit risk of deposits and investments. However, each pension trust fund utilizes multiple investment managers 
and limits cash and short-term investments to no more than 5% of each investment manager’s portfolio. At June 30, 2018, 
the pension trust funds had deposits and cash equivalents of $811,776,000 of which $23,576,000 were uninsured and 
uncollateralized. 
 
Component Units 
 
Generally, the component units of the state have investment policies that do not specifically address or limit custodial 
credit risk of deposits and investments. All component units typically follow the diversification and securitization of 
deposit policies defined by the State Treasurer in an effort to minimize custodial credit risk.  
 
B.  Credit Risk 
 
Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk. Credit quality rating is one method of assessing the debt instrument 
issuer’s ability to meet its obligation. The state, its fiduciary funds and component units utilize the credit quality ratings 
issued by Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s (S&P), or Fitch in determining the risk associated with its fixed-income 
investments. Obligations of the U.S. government or those explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government are not 
considered to have credit risk. Certain debt instruments are commingled investments that do not have an applicable credit 
risk rating. These investments are presented as not rated in the accompanying tables. 
 
Primary Government 
 
As outlined in an earlier table, the State Treasurer seeks to hold investments with a rating of A or higher as rated by 
Moody’s. Generally, the permanent funds and the business-type activities seek to maintain the same or higher rating. The 
Water Resources Board, which has a high concentration of investments with one issuer, requires that issuer to maintain an 
average credit rating of AA or higher. Should this issuer’s rating fall below AA, it is required to collateralize the 
guaranteed investments sufficient to maintain an AA rating on the contracts. At June 30, 2018, the primary government 
had the following investments subject to credit risk (expressed in thousands): 

 
 
Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 
 
The pension trust funds typically hold a significant portion of assets in the form of debt instruments. Each pension trust 
fund has an investment policy governing their credit risk exposure. Generally, at the time of purchase, investments in 
domestic fixed-income investments must carry the highest rating either Aaa, (Moody’s) or AAA, (S&P, Fitch) as 
determined by the national rating organizations. International debt instruments must be Baa or BBB at the time of 
purchase. Overall, each investment policy generally requires that an average credit quality rating of A or higher be

maintained for total debt instrument holdings. At June 30, 2018, the Pension Trust Funds had the following credit risk 
exposure (expressed in thousands): 
  

 
 
Component Units 
 
The component units usually hold a significant portion of their respective portfolios in debt instruments. Each component 
unit has an investment policy governing credit risk. As a general rule, the component units have more liberal investment 
policies than the primary government that allow for greater levels of credit risk regarding debt securities. Foundations 
within the Higher Education Component Unit also hold a significant portion of their total debt portfolio as either bond 
funds or money market mutual funds. These debt instruments are generally pooled or commingled investments and are 
not subject to credit risk disclosures. Investments in U.S. government securities are not subject to credit risk. At June 30, 
2018, the component units had the following credit risk exposure (expressed in thousands): 

 

 
 
C.  Concentration of Credit Risk 
 
Primary Government 
 
The State Treasurer’s investment policy seeks to mitigate concentration of credit risk through targeted diversification 
limits as outlined earlier in this note. With the exception of US Treasury securities, no more than 50% of the state’s total 
funds available for investment are invested in a single security type or with a single financial institution. The Water 
Resources Board, a business-type activity of the primary government, has no policy limiting amounts that may be 
invested in one issuer.  
 
D.  Interest Rate Risk 
 
Interest Rate Risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment or deposit. 
Duration is a measure of a debt instrument’s exposure to fair value changes arising from changes in interest rates based on 
the present value of future cash flows, weighted for those cash flows as a percentage of the investment’s full price. 
Modified duration estimates the sensitivity of a bond’s price to interest rate changes. The state, its Fiduciary Funds, and

component units use either duration, modified duration or weighted average years outstanding as the standard measures 
for assessing interest rate risk. Generally, the longer the duration or years outstanding, the greater sensitivity an 
investment has to interest rate risk.  
 

Primary Government 

As outlined in a previous table, the State Treasurer follows an investment policy seeking to keep the average maturity for 
its entire portfolio to less than four years. The Permanent Funds and the business-type activities of the primary 
government do not have the same liquidity demands as the treasurer, and as a matter of policy are not as restrictive 
regarding maturities. At June 30, 2018, the primary government had the following investments with maturities (expressed 
in thousands): 

 
 
Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 
 
The Pension Trust Funds generally do not have a formal investment policy on interest rate risk. However, interest rate risk 
is generally controlled through diversification of portfolio management styles. Each Pension Trust Fund reviews the 
performance of each investment manager, and monitors the interest rate risk as part of the performance assessment. At 
June 30, 2018, the Pension Trust Funds had the following exposure to interest rate risk (expressed in thousands): 
 

 
Component Units 
 
The state’s component units typically have board approved investment policies designed to manage exposure to fair value 
losses that arise from interest rate risk. The policies of the various component units can differ significantly since each 
investment policy is designed to match the portfolio objectives for that component unit. A substantial portion of the 
component units’ holdings in debt instruments is in money market mutual funds and bond mutual funds with demand 
maturities which are presented below as not having an applicable maturity. On June 30, 2018, the component units had 
the following interest rate risk exposure (expressed in thousands):

E.  Foreign Currency Risk 
 
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in currency exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of a deposit or 
investment. The state, its fiduciary funds and component units typically make investments in foreign securities to achieve 
an additional level of diversification within the various portfolios under management. Foreign currencies held as cash and 
cash equivalents are usually held to limit losses in foreign investments due to fluctuations in currency values.

Securities Lending Activity - Primary Government 
 
State Statute Title 62, Section 90 authorizes the Office of the State Treasurer to participate in securities lending 
transactions. All securities held by J.P. Morgan, as trustee or custodian, may be lent in the securities lending program 
unless specifically excluded by the Office of the State Treasurer.  
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, securities lending agents lent primarily U.S. government securities. Cash and 
U.S. government securities were provided as collateral for the securities lent. Generally, collateral must equal at least 
100% of the fair value of the securities loaned. At June 30, 2018, there were no securities on loan. The collateral balance 
of $21,855,000 represents cash collateral that is invested in U.S. government securities and is included as an asset on the 
balance sheet with an offsetting liability for the return of collateral. 
 
At June 30, 2018, there was no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the primary government owes the 
borrowers exceed the amounts the borrowers owe the primary government. Contracts with securities lending agents 
require them to indemnify the lender if the borrower fails to return the securities or otherwise fails to pay the lender for 
income while the securities are on loan. There were no losses on security lending transactions, or recoveries from prior 
period losses, that resulted from the default of a borrower or the lending agent. Because these transactions are terminable 
at will, their duration generally did not match the duration of the investments made with cash collateral.  
 
The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust Fund (TSET), a Permanent Fund of the state, participates in securities lending 
as defined by its investment policy. During the year, TSET lent U.S. government securities, corporate debt, and domestic 
and foreign equities. Collateral was provided as cash for securities lent. Collateral must equal at least 102% of the market 
value of securities lent unless the principal market for the collateral is outside the U.S., in which case a margin of 105% 
must be maintained. At June 30, 2018, the fair value of securities on loan was $105,537,000. The collateral for securities 
lent had a market value of $110,178,000. The investment made with cash collateral had an average maturity of one day 
and did not match the duration of the security on loan since the loans are terminable at will. There was no credit risk to 
borrowers.  
 
Securities Lending Activity - Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 
 
The six Public Employees Retirement Systems (PERS) participate in securities lending transactions as provided by their 
respective investment policies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, securities lending agents lent primarily U.S. 
government securities, equity securities, and debt securities. Cash, U.S. government securities, and letters of credit were 
provided as collateral for the securities lent. Generally, collateral must be provided in the amount of 102% of the fair 
value of the securities loaned. In certain instances collateral must be provided in the amount of 105% when the principal 
trading market for the loaned securities is outside the U.S. At June 30, 2018, the carrying amount and fair value of 
securities on loan was approximately $2,322,688,000. The underlying collateral for these securities had a fair value of 
approximately $2,543,873,000. Collateral of securities and letters of credit represented approximately $163,175,000 of 
total collateral. These securities and letters of credit cannot be sold or pledged unless the borrower defaults, therefor the 
collateral and related liability is not presented on the balance sheet. The remaining collateral represents cash collateral 
that is invested in short-term investment pools and is included as an asset on the balance sheet with an offsetting liability 
for the return of the collateral. 
 
At June 30, 2018, there was no credit risk exposure to borrowers because the amounts the fiduciary funds owe the 
borrowers exceed the amounts the borrowers owe the fiduciary funds. Contracts with securities lending agents require 
them to indemnify the lender if the borrower fails to return the securities or otherwise fails to pay the lender for income 
while the securities are on loan. There were no losses on security lending transactions, or recoveries from prior period 
losses, resulting from the default of a borrower or the lending agent. Investment policies do not require the maturities of 
investments made with cash collateral to match the maturities of securities lent; however, investment policies may 
establish minimum levels of liquidity to minimize the interest rate risk associated with not matching the maturity of the 
investments with the loans. Generally, their duration did not match the duration of the investments made with cash 
collateral.

Derivative Investments Definition 

Derivatives are often complex financial arrangements used to manage specific risks or to act as investments. Derivatives 
can act as hedges to more effectively manage cash flow or act as investments thereby increasing or decreasing exposure to 
certain types of investments. 

Derivative Investments - Primary Government 

Certain state agencies utilize derivative investments as tools to efficiently and effectively manage domestic, international 
and fixed income investments within their respective portfolios. Investments for TSET are reported at fair value based on 
the cash flows from interest and principal payments. The notional amount, financial statement classification and fair value 
balance of derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2018, and the change in fair value of such derivatives for the year then 
ended are as follows (expressed in thousands): 

Derivative Investments - Fiduciary Funds and Similar Component Units 

Several of the state’s Public Employees Retirement Systems (PERS) utilize derivative investments as tools to efficiently 
and effectively manage domestic, international and fixed income investments within their respective portfolios. The 
notional amount, financial statement classification and fair value balance of derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2018, and 
the change in fair value of such derivatives for the year then ended are as follows (expressed in thousands): 

The OFPRS system uses foreign currency forward contracts primarily to hedge foreign currency exposure. The fair values 
of all OFPRS derivative instruments are determined from market quotes of the instruments or similar instruments. The 
receivable is net of gross receivables of $747,000 and liabilities of $3,040,000. The gross receivables are supported by 
collateral in investments valued at $747,000 with a credit risk ratings of A by S&P and A2 by Moody’s. The foreign 
currency forward contracts for the TRS subject the System to foreign currency risk because the investments are 
denominated in foreign currencies. The fair values of foreign currency forward contracts for TRS are estimated based on 
the present value of their estimated cash flows.  

Derivative Investments - Component Units 

The component units of the state have varied investment goals based on the demands of their specific operations and 
commonly have investment policies allowing for greater investment diversity and risk. Certain component units and 
foundations with the Higher Education Component Unit will utilize derivative investments on occasion to secure specific 
returns matched to maturing liabilities to mitigate overall portfolio risk.

The general fund due from other funds includes $53,986,000 from Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) ($53,706,000 at 
December 31, 2017) for a portion of motor fuel excise taxes collected on fuels consumed on turnpikes. The balance 
accumulates and is payable when certain OTA revenue bonds payable are paid in full. The Wildlife Lifetime Licenses 
Permanent Fund is due $91,000 from the general fund for legislative mandated transfer of earnings on certain funds. 

Remaining interfund balances resulted from the time lag between the dates that interfund goods and services are provided 
or reimbursable expenditures occur, transactions are recorded, and payment between funds are made. 

B.  Notes Payable and Capital Leases 

The Higher Education (HE) component unit has entered into capital lease agreements with the general fund’s Oklahoma 
Capital Improvement Authority (OCIA) to lease various facilities, equipment and improvements. The capital lease 
outstanding balances are $341,027,000.

general, the state is self-insured for health care claims (except for employee participation in certain health maintenance 
organizations), workers' compensation, and second injury workers’ compensation. The state is also self-insured against 
tort and automobile liability and property losses, with commercial insurance policies for losses that fall outside of 
coverage limits or are in excess of the self-insured retention.  

Coverage for health care claims and workers' compensation is provided by two entities of the state. The Employees Group 
Insurance Division (EGID), a department of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services (OMES), manages a legal 
trust which provides group health, life, dental, and disability benefits to the state's employees and certain other eligible 
participants. Effective January 1, 2015, the Risk Management Department (RMD), part of Capital Assets Management, a 
division of OMES, was authorized to handle workers’ compensation for all state agencies when House Bill 2009 was 
signed into law during 2014. The Risk Management Department Consolidated Workers’ Compensation Program began 
operating on July 1, 2015. 

Coverage for second injury workers’ compensation is provided by a discretely presented component unit. The Multiple 
Injury Trust Fund (MITF) was created to encourage the hiring of individuals with a pre-existing disability and to protect 
those employers from liability for the pre-existing disability. MITF records a liability for outstanding court awards only as 
those amounts are awarded by the Workers' Compensation Court of Existing Claims (WCCEC) for permanent total 
disability awards. There is no provision for incurred but not reported claims or claims pending WCCEC determination. 
Claims and Judgments which were due and owing at December 31, 2017, were charged to operations for the year ended 
December 31, 2017. At year end, the MITF loss liability exceeded net position. MITF was indebted to claimants for court 
awarded judgments. Only those judgments currently payable in arrears bear interest. The rate is established by the 
WCCEC or the Workers’ Compensation Commission and ranges from 5.25% to 5.5%.  

Coverage for liability and property losses is provided by the RMD of OMES. The RMD administers a self-insurance 
program to protect the state, its agencies, colleges, and universities against tort and automobile liability claims. Coverage 
and limits under this program correspond directly with the Oklahoma Governmental Tort Claims Act (GTCA). The RMD 
purchases commercial liability insurance for losses that fall outside of the GTCA. The RMD also provides a property 
insurance program for all agencies, colleges, and universities through a combination of a high self-insured retention and 
commercial insurance policies in excess of the self-insured retention. Coverage limits are $1 billion for each occurrence 
subject to coverage terms and conditions. Commercial insurance is purchased to protect the state’s fine arts and physical 
damage to its automobiles. Additionally, the RMD purchases a government crime policy, i.e., Employee Dishonesty 
policy. 

Except for MITF, estimates relating to incurred but not reported claims, as well as other probable and estimable losses are 
included in accrued liabilities for each fund. None of the funds have included non-incremental claims adjustment expense 
as part of accrued liabilities. Because actual claims liabilities are impacted by complex factors including inflation, 
changes in legal doctrines and unanticipated damage awards, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not 
necessarily result in exact amounts. Claims liabilities are re-evaluated periodically to take into consideration recently 
settled claims and other economic and social factors. 

The general fund self-insurance loss liability for the RMD of OMES represents an estimate of amounts to be paid from 
economic financial resources.

Public Entity Risk Pool – Employees Group Insurance Division 

The state operates the Employees Group Insurance Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
(EGID), a public entity risk pool. 

A. Description of Plan 

EGID provides group health, dental, life, and disability benefits to active state employees and local government 
employees, as well as varying coverages for active education employees and certain participants of the state’s retirement 
systems, survivors, and persons covered by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). 
Disability coverage is available only to active state employees and local government employees. EGID is self-insured and 
provides participants with the option of electing coverage from certain health maintenance organizations (HMOs). 
Premium rates for the various groups are established separately. 

The coverages are funded by monthly premiums paid by individuals, the state, local governments, educational employers, 
and retirement systems. A participant may extend coverage to dependents for an additional monthly premium based on 
the coverage requested. Of the 223,000 primary participants and dependents, approximately 23,000 primary participants 
and 14,000 dependents were covered by HMOs. These counts relate to health coverage only. 

All state agencies are required to participate in EGID. Eligible local governments may elect to participate in EGID (317 
local governments actually participate). Any education entity or local government which elects to withdraw from EGID 
may do so with 30 days written notice, and must withdraw both its active and inactive participants.

B. Unpaid Claims Liabilities 

EGID establishes policy and contract claim reserves based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims that are 
reported but not settled, and of claims that are incurred but not yet reported. Disability reserves are also established based 
on the estimated ultimate cost of settling claims of participants currently receiving benefits and for disability claims 
incurred but not yet reported to EGID. 

The reserves are determined using EGID's historical benefit payment experience. The length of time for which costs must 
be estimated depends on the coverages involved. Although such estimates are EGID's best estimates of the incurred 
claims to be paid, due to the complex nature of the factors involved in the calculation, the actual results may be more or 
less than the estimate. The claim liabilities are recomputed on a periodic basis using actuarial and statistical techniques 
which consider the effects of general economic conditions, such as inflation, and other factors of past experience, such as 
changes in participant counts. Adjustments to claim liabilities are recorded in the periods in which they are made. 
Premium deficiency reserves are recorded when the anticipated costs of settling claims for the following fiscal year are in 
excess of the anticipated premium receipts for the following year, as required. Anticipated investment income is 
considered in determining whether a premium deficiency exists.

Direct Financing Leases 

The Department of Transportation (DOT) maintains leases classified as direct financing leases. The state leases heavy 
equipment and machinery to counties within the state. The lease terms are determined by the depreciation schedules 
published by the American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials. All new county equipment leases 
were charged an interest amount equivalent to 3% of the equipment cost. Title for this equipment passes to the counties 
at the end of the lease term. DOT also leases railroad lines within the state to various railroad companies with the 
longest lease term ending in 2026. No interest or executory costs are charged, and the leases include bargain purchase 
options. The unguaranteed residual values of the machinery, equipment, and railroad lines are not estimated by the 
state. Contingent rentals are not a part of any lease and uncollectible amounts are not expected. The total minimum 
lease payments to be received by DOT in future years are approximately $22,918,000 which is also the net investment 
in direct financing leases at June 30, 2018. The following schedule represents minimum lease payments receivable for 
direct financing leases for each of the five succeeding fiscal years (expressed in thousands):

Operating Leases 

Non-state entities lease primarily state land and a lesser amount of state owned buildings through operating leases 
maintained by various state agencies. Due to the passage of time, the state’s historical cost of the leased land is not 
reasonably determinable. The leased buildings consist of sub-leased office space under an operating lease. Since the 
state does not have a cost basis in the building, no depreciation expense is recognized. The primary government’s total 
operating leases receivable recognized in the current fiscal year is approximately $2,000. Minimum future rentals 
receivable from these operating leases is presented in the following schedule (expressed in thousands): 
 

 
 

In addition, the leasing operations of the Commissioners of the Land Office consist of leasing approximately 740,000 
acres of land principally for agricultural purposes. The lease terms are generally for five-year periods with one-fifth of 
the leases expiring each year. The lease year is on a calendar year basis with rents prepaid one year in advance. The 
rental amount is determined based on the maximum amount bid by the lessee. The following schedule presents 
minimum future rentals receivable from the noncancelable leasing of these lands (expressed in thousands): 
 

 
 

The Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation (ODTR) has various contracts with concessionaires to provide

The Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) executed a Power Purchase Agreement with FPL Energy 
Oklahoma Wind, LLC (FPLE Oklahoma), for the development of a wind generation facility in northwestern Oklahoma. 
Under the agreement, FPLE Oklahoma was responsible for acquiring, constructing and installing the wind project. 
OMPA issued taxable limited obligation notes which were payable solely from lease payments made by FPLE 
Oklahoma. OMPA used the proceeds of the notes to finance OMPA’s acquisition of the wind project and has leased the 
wind project to FPLE Oklahoma under a long-term capital lease agreement for an amount sufficient to pay the debt 
service, principal and interest, on the notes. The power purchase agreement has a term of approximately 25 years and 
power is sold on a take and pay basis. FPLE Oklahoma retains the operational risk related to the wind project. The

OKLAHOMA  105 

The following table presents annual debt service requirements for those long-term obligations outstanding at June 30, 
2018, which have scheduled debt service amounts (expressed in thousands): 
 

 

A. General Obligation Bonds 
 
General obligation bonds, administered by the State Treasurer, are authorized and issued primarily to provide resources 
for state-owned capital improvements, including office buildings for state agencies. The state has pledged 100% of 
cigarette taxes collected under these bond issues. General obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the 
state, including the state's power to levy additional taxes to ensure repayment of the bonds. 

B. Revenue Bonds 
 

The Oklahoma Capitol Improvement Authority (OCIA) has eighteen outstanding series of building bonds to construct and 
equip state office buildings and prisons. Principal and interest payments on these bond issues are paid from rents collected 
from the various state and federal agencies that occupy the buildings constructed with the bond proceeds. The sale of 
series 2017C bonds for $27,215,000 was issued for construction and furnishing of the Museum of Popular Culture in 
Tulsa.  
 
The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (ODFA) issues lease revenue bonds to provide lease financing for the 
Department of Corrections, the Department of Human Services, the Council for Law Enforcement Education and 
Training, and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The actual lease payments are made to a trustee who is 
responsible for payments to individual investors.

The following table presents annual debt service requirements for those long-term obligations outstanding at June 30, 
2018 (September 30, 2017, for Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency and December 31, 2017, for Oklahoma 
Transportation Authority, Grand River Dam Authority and Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority), which have scheduled 
debt service amounts (expressed in thousands): 

A. General Obligation Bonds 

Oklahoma Industrial Finance Authority (OIFA) has four series of general obligation bonds outstanding. These bonds are 
issued for the funding of industrial finance loans to encourage business development within the state. All revenues arising 
from the net proceeds from repayment of industrial finance loans and interest received thereon are pledged under these 
bond issues. In addition, these general obligation bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the state. 

B. Revenue Bonds 

The Oklahoma Student Loan Authority (OSLA) has issued four series of revenue bonds with outstanding balances. The 
bonds were issued for the purpose of funding student loans. All bonds payable are primarily secured by the student loans 
receivable, related accrued interest and by the amounts on deposit in the accounts established under the respective bond 
resolution. Variable interest rates are adjusted periodically based on prevailing market rates of various instruments as 
prescribed in bond indentures. At June 30, 2018, the variable interest rates ranged from 2.6% to 3.5%. 

The Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (ODFA) has issued revenue bonds to fund loans to various investment 
enterprises in connection with the Quality Jobs Investment Program. The bonds are payable solely from and secured by 
the revenues and funds in the Quality Jobs Investment Program and a Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund guarantee 
insurance policy. The interest rates are variable and equal to OIFA’s cost of funds on its outstanding variable rate bond 
issues. The interest rate at June 30, 2018 was 2.5%.

future debt service requirements beyond one year. 
 
G. Authorized Unissued Bonds 
  
By statute, OIFA has authority to issue general obligation bonds not to exceed $90,000,000 plus the balance in its bond 
redemption account. This results in $50,000,000 of authorized but unissued general obligation bonds. Certain institutions

Governmental Fund Balance 
 

The governmental fund financial statements present fund balance at the aggregate level of detail within the categories 
defined by GASB Statement 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions. The table below 
represents the detailed amount of fund balance available to each functional level of government within those categories. 
This table also contains a separate detailed categorization for the state’s stabilization, or “Rainy Day” fund if a balance is 
available at the end of fiscal year (expressed in thousands): 

 

 
 
Nonspendable fund balance represents amounts that are not in spendable form. These amounts are not expected to be 
converted to cash. The state’s primary forms of nonspendable fund balance are inventories and prepaid items such as rent 
or postage. Nonspendable fund balance also includes principal amounts within each respective permanent fund that is 
legally required to be maintained into perpetuity. 
 
Restricted fund balance represents amounts that have constraints upon their use through either outside creditors, grantors, 
contributors or other governments as well as those amounts restricted through constitutional provisions or enabling 
legislation that can be legally enforced by parties outside the government. The state’s general fund restricted fund balance 
is primarily comprised of amounts yet to be expended under federal grant awards, imminent payments on outstanding

systems. Fund balance as restricted by the various constraints in the general fund for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, 
are as follows (expressed in thousands): 

Committed fund balance is presented for each respective function of government as directed by the state’s highest level 
of decision making authority. Along with ratification by the governor, the Senate and the House of Representatives write, 
prepare and approve legislative bills to allocate the state’s available resources each fiscal year. This process is a formal 
legislative action constituting the highest level of decision making authority. Once this authority is exercised, the same 
action must be taken to modify or rescind a previously approved bill or allocation of resources. 

Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) reporting, the nonspendable and restricted fund balance 
categories are considered restricted fund balance. The committed, assigned and unassigned fund balances are considered 
to be unrestricted fund balances. Generally, when the state has both restricted and unrestricted resources available, the 
restricted balances are used first as expenditures are incurred as long as conditions that created the restriction are met. 
When unrestricted fund balances are used, the order of use is generally committed, then assigned, and finally unassigned.  

Article 10, Section 23 of the State Constitution establishes a stabilization arrangement (Constitutional Reserve or “Rainy 
Day” Fund) under certain conditions where revenues collected exceed estimates made by the State Board of Equalization 
(Board). Each year the Board determines the amount available for allocation by the legislature not to exceed 95% of the 
Board’s estimate, or general revenue fund (GRF) certification amount. In any year in which amounts collected exceed 
100% of the Board’s estimated revenues, the excess is placed in the Constitutional Reserve Fund (CRF) until the fund 
reaches 15% of the GRF certification amount for the preceding fiscal year. Up to 37.5% of the balance in the fund at the 
beginning of the year may be appropriated for the forthcoming fiscal year when the Board’s estimate is lower than the 
current fiscal year certification. An additional 37.5% of the CRF at the beginning of the year may be appropriated for the 
current year if the Board determines that a revenue failure has occurred with respect to the GRF for the current year. The 
remaining 25% of the balance in the CRF may be appropriated upon a declaration by the governor that emergency 
conditions exist with concurrence by a two-thirds vote within the Senate and House of Representatives. This same 25% 
may also be appropriated through a joint declaration of emergency by both the Senate and House of Representatives 
with a concurrent 3/4ths vote by each legislative body. Due to the different methods for accessing the CRF, any 
balance within the fund at year end is presented as 75% restricted and 25% unassigned. This split in presentation most 
closely aligns the government’s ability to access these funds with the proper fund balance classification. The total CRF 
balance at June 30, 2018, was $451,649,000, with $338,737,000 presented as restricted fund balance and $112,912,000 
as unassigned fund balance. 

The Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust Fund’s assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts that are 
constrained by the fund’s intent to be used for specific purposes. For purposes of assigned fund balance, the fund’s Board 
of Directors has authority to assign funds for specific purposes. Prior to 2012, the Board of Directors had determined that 
10% of the unassigned fund balance would be designated as a reserve for future periods, should annual earnings prove 
insufficient to cover expenses. In November 2011, the Board of Directors chose to limit yearly expenditures of certified

earnings to no more than 5% of the corpus of the fund, with any unexpended certified earnings added to the reserve. For 
the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the assigned fund balance was $41,789,000. 
 
As explained in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, section J, the general fund inventory includes 
$455,000 in food commodities which is also included in deferred revenue. Therefore, nonspendable fund balance for 
inventory/prepaid on the balance sheet is $455,000 less than the total of inventory and prepaid items. 

 

Note 13. Nonrecourse Debt and Debt Guarantees 
 
Nonrecourse (Conduit) Debt, Notes Receivable and Funds in Trust 
 
Financing agreements of Oklahoma Development Finance Authority (ODFA) and Oklahoma Housing Finance Agency 
(OHFA) are structured such that the debt is to be repaid solely from the revenues derived from the related facilities leased 
or acquired, or from the disposition of collateral. ODFA and OHFA do not hold notes receivable and trust investments in 
amounts equal to the long-term financings. As of September 30, 2017, OHFA had six series of multifamily bonds 
outstanding with an aggregate principal amount payable of approximately $69,130,000. These financings are not general 
obligations of the state or state agencies, and it is the opinion of agency management and its legal counsel that, in the 
event of default by a borrower, the state has no responsibility for repayment of such financings. Accordingly, the 
nonrecourse debt and the related notes receivable and trust investments of ODFA and OHFA’s multifamily bond 
programs are excluded from the financial statements. The debt and other obligations and the related notes receivable and 
other assets of OHFA’s single family bonds are presented in the financial statements, since any assets remaining when the 
single family bond programs are liquidated are transferred to OHFA. 
 
Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund  
 
Under the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma, ODFA may issue bonds of the state, to be known as Credit 
Enhancement Reserve Fund General Obligation Bonds, in a total principal amount of $100,000,000, for the sole purpose 
of generating resources if there are insufficient assets to meet insurance obligations. The fund is managed, administered, 
and utilized by ODFA solely to secure the payment of interest insurance on the revenue bonds and other financial 
obligations issued by ODFA for the specific purpose of enhancing and supporting the credit of such obligations. As of 
June 30, 2018, there were approximately $32,200,000 of outstanding financial obligations insured by ODFA. At year end, 
the fund has accrued a reserve for losses of approximately $633,000 to cover potential losses from outstanding financial 
obligations insured by the fund. Through June 30, 2018, there are no Oklahoma Credit Enhancement Reserve Fund 
General Obligation Bonds issued since it is the intention of ODFA to utilize existing assets to meet obligations arising 
from losses reserved and accrued payments in lieu of interest by the fund.

Note 14. Retirement and Pension Systems 
 
A. Plan Description 
The State of Oklahoma has six public employee retirement systems (PERS) that administer pension plans: Oklahoma 
Firefighters Pension and Retirement System (OFPRS), Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System (OLERS), 
Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), Uniform Retirement System for Justices and Judges (URSJJ), 
Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System (OPPRS), and the Teachers Retirement System of Oklahoma (TRS). 
These plans are all fiduciary component units of the state. The Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) administers 
the Wildlife Conservation Retirement Plan (WCRP), which is part of the primary government.  
 
OFPRS, OPERS, OPPRS, and TRS are all cost-sharing, multi-employer defined benefit retirement systems. URSJJ, 
OLERS and WCRP are single-employer, defined benefit retirement systems. Pension benefit provisions for all plans are 
established by statute and benefit provisions are amended by the state Legislature. Each plan provides retirement, 
disability, and death benefits to plan members and their beneficiaries. Cost-of-living adjustments are provided to plan 
members at the discretion of the state Legislature. The information and schedules which follow are the representation of 
the respective state and local governmental employer pension plans which are administered through trusts.  
 
Separately issued independent audit reports for each pension plan may be obtained from the following: 

 

 
 
B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources 
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the respective pension plans and 
additions to/deductions from plans fiduciary net position is determined on the same basis as they are reported by each 
pension plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due 
and payable in accordance with the benefit terms.

Oklahoma Firefighters Pension and Retirement System 

 
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members are made 
at the current contribution rate and that contributions from employers are made at contractually required rates. Projected 
cash flows also assume insurance premium taxes are contributed as determined by state statutes. 

 
Based on these assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to make projected 
benefit payments. Therefore, the discount rate used is 7.5% which is the long-term expected rate of return on plan 
investments. 

 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments is determined using a building-block method in which 
best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and 
inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding 
expected inflation. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are 
summarized in the following table:

best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and 
inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding 
expected inflation. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are 
summarized in the following table: 

 

 
 

H. Changes in Net Pension Liability  
 
The total pension liability for the various pension systems is determined based on actuarial valuations performed 
as of July 1, 2017, which is also the measurement date. There are no changes in assumptions or changes between 
the measurement date of July 1, 2017, and the state’s report ending date of June 30, 2018, that would have a 
significant impact on the net pension liability. The following tables report the components of changes in net 
pension liability (in thousands):

O. Defined Contribution Plans 
 
The ODWC’s defined contribution plan (DC Plan) is a single-employer plan that covers the employees of ODWC with a 
hire date of July 1, 2010, or later. The DC Plan provides retirement benefits to plan members and their beneficiaries. At 
June 30, 2018, there were 125 plan members. Plan members are required to contribute 5% of compensation annually. The 
ODWC’s annual contribution is based on the employee’s number of completed years of credited service with the ODWC, 
defined as follows: 
 

 
 
Employees vest in 100% of ODWC’s contributions after 5 years of credited service. 
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the ODWC contributed $316,000, and eligible employees contributed $248,000 to the 
DC Plan. 
 
House Bill 2630 and Senate Bill 2120 directed OPERS to establish a defined contribution retirement system for members 
first employed by a participating employer of the system on or after November 1, 2015, including statewide elected 
officials and legislators. The provisions of this bill are not applicable to hazardous duty members, district attorneys, 
assistant district attorneys or other employees of the district attorney’s office who will continue to participate in the 
defined benefit plan. Also excluded are employees of a county, county elected officials, county hospital, city or town, 
conservation district, circuit engineering district, and any public or private trust in which a county, city or town 
participates and is the primary beneficiary. 
 
This defined contribution plan was created and implemented during the year ended June 30, 2016. Under this plan, 
participating employees contribute a minimum of 4.5% of their compensation. Participating employers match employee 
contributions up to 7%. In addition to the matching contributions, participating employers are required to remit to OPERS 
the difference between the matching contributions for defined contribution plan members and the amount the participating 
employer would have contributed for a defined benefit plan member. 
 
At June 30, 2018, there were 6,605 plan members. For the year ended June 30, 2018, OPERS contributed $9,481,000 and 
eligible employees contributed $6,632,000 to the plan.

Note 15. Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) 
 

1. General Description of the Other Postemployment Benefits 
  

The Employees Group Insurance Division (EGID), a division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services 
(OMES) manages a legal insurance trust which provides group health, life, dental and disability benefits for active 
employees and retirees (should they so elect) of state agencies, school districts and other governmental units. EGID, as a 
multi-line insurance provider, allows for retirees that are not yet eligible for Medicare benefits to participate in the 
insurance plans available to active employees. Current and retired employees participate in the same plans with blended 
premium rates creating an implicit rate subsidy for the retirees in the plan. This plan is not administered through a trust, 
and as a result, there are no assets to net against the total liability. Separately issued reports for the EGID plan can be 
obtained at https://omes.ok.gov/services/accounting-reporting. 
 
ODWC, part of the primary government, at its expense, provides a health insurance allowance to retirees for the payment 
of health insurance premiums at retirement where the retiree elects continued coverage through EGID. This allowance is 
reduced when the retiree is eligible for Medicare. The coverage amount is established by ODWC on an annual basis and 
can be discontinued at the board’s discretion. 
 
As mandated by statute, the Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System (OLERS), Oklahoma Public Employees 
Retirement System (OPERS), Uniform Retirement System for Judges and Justices (URSJJ) and Teachers’ Retirement 
System (TRS) provide an OPEB benefit to retirees should a retiree make such an election at retirement to continue health 
coverage through the state’s provider, EGID. This benefit is for a fixed amount that varies slightly from pension to 
pension, and the contribution is included in the employer pension contribution. Methods for obtaining separately issued 
independent audit reports, a summary of significant accounting policies of the pension plans and the statutory authority 
under which OPEB benefits are required to be paid are discussed in Note 14.

3. Net OPEB Liability 
 
The State of Oklahoma measured a net OPEB asset of $11,819,000 and a net OPEB liability of $170,346,000 as of June 
30, 2017, as determined by actuarial valuations of that date. 
 
The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2017, actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial 
assumptions and other inputs, applied to all periods included in the measurement unless otherwise specified: 
 

 
 
Discount Rates 
 
The discount rate was determined using the Bond Buyer GO 20-Bond Municipal Bond Index for the EGID. The discount 
rate for ODWC was measured using a Fidelity 20-year municipal bond index rate (AA/Aa or higher) as of June 29, 2018. 
For the remainder of OPEB plans, the discount rate is determined by the expected rate of return on assets of the associated 
pension plan as referenced in Note 14. 
 
Mortality Rates 
 
Mortality rates for EGID were based on RP-2006 combined healthy mortality table with a fully generational projection 
using Scale MP-2017.  
 
ODWC based mortality rates for active and retired members on RP-2014 employee mortality tables with blue collar 
adjustment, projected to 2030 with Scale BB (separate rates for males and females). Disabled members of the ODWC 
plan have mortality rates calculated using the RP-2014 mortality table for disabled annuitants with blue collar adjustment, 
projected to 2030 with scale BB, separate rates for males and females. 
 
The Oklahoma Law Enforcement Retirement System (OLERS) uses RP-2014 blue collar healthy table with generational 
projection using Scale MP-2016 for both pre-retirement and post-retirement for retiree mortality rates. For disability 
mortality rates, OLERS uses RP-2014 blue collar table with no projection from the 2006 base rates.  
 
For the actuarial report prepared as of June 30, 2017, the Uniform Retirement System for Judges and Justices (URSJJ) 
determined mortality rates using RP-2014 blue collar active healthy mortality table with base rates projected to 2025 
using scale MP-2016 rates set back one year. URSJJ uses RP-2014 blue collar retiree healthy mortality table with base 
rates projected to 2025 using Scale MP-2016 for retirees and disability mortality rates were based on the post-retirement 
mortality rates with rates set forward twelve years. 
 
The Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) uses RP-2014 mortality tables projected to 2025 by scale 
MP-2016. Disabled pensioner rates are set forward twelve years. 
 
Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (OTRS) determines the discount rate using RP-2000 combined healthy mortality 
table for males with white collar adjustments for male retirees. Generational mortality improvements are in accordance 
with scale BB from the table’s base year of 2000. For female retirees, OTRS uses Gabriel Roder Smith & Company

Oklahoma State University has outstanding commitments under construction contracts of approximately $64,558,000 at 
June 30, 2018.  
 
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) has commitments outstanding at December 31, 2017, relating to equipment 
orders and supplies of approximately $12,636,000. At December 31, 2017, OTA has commitments outstanding relating to 
construction and maintenance contracts of approximately $106,087,000. 
  
The Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority (OMPA) purchased approximately $15,241,000 of power pursuant to several 
long-term purchase agreements during 2017. OMPA is obligated to purchase, at a minimum, approximately $14,770,000 
of power in 2018. 
 
The Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) makes and receives commitments for purchases of coal and other materials. 
GRDA had contractual commitments at December 31, 2017 for long-term coal and freight purchases through 2025. The 
estimated minimum obligations for the next fiscal year, ending December 31, 2018, are $40,045,000, and total obligations 
of $362,578,000 are through 2025.  

 

Note 18. Litigation and Contingencies 
 
The state and its component units are parties to numerous legal proceedings, many of which normally occur in 
governmental operations. Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, claims assessed against the state for property 
damage and personal injury, alleged breaches of contract, condemnation proceedings, and other alleged violations of state 
and federal laws. Certain claims were adjudicated against the state, but remain unpaid as of June 30, 2018. 
  
The state receives significant financial assistance from the federal government in the form of grants and entitlements. 
Assistance is generally conditioned upon compliance with requirements of the grant agreements and applicable federal 
regulations, including the expenditure of the resources for eligible purposes. Substantially all grants are subject to 
financial and compliance audits by federal agencies. Any disallowance as a result of these audits can become a liability of 
the state.  
  
Primary Government 
 
Through the normal course of operations there are many legal cases which involve the state as a party. Most of these 
cases are currently deemed to have a remote chance of loss or will result in a gain to the state. The assessment of several 
cases indicates there is the reasonably possible or probable chance of a loss occurring to the state. Current estimates for 
these losses range from $933,000 to $37,192,000.  
 
The Department of Transportation (DOT) incurred significant expenditures on construction projects that exceeded the 
amounts approved by the federal grantor. These project expenditures are held in suspense until approved by the federal 
grantor and subsequently reimbursed. Based on prior years' experience, the reimbursement of expenditures is highly 
probable. At June 30, 2018, DOT has project expenditures of $233,000 that shall be reimbursed pending approval of the 
federal grantor.  
 
Component Units 
 
The Oklahoma Capital Investment Board (OCIB), as a public trust of the State of Oklahoma, has authority to transfer tax 
credits to public entities. Tax credits can be transferred by OCIB in conjunction with a legitimate call on an OCIB 
guarantee. As of June 30, 2018, OCIB has a maximum commitment line of credit of $16,000,000, and the line of credit 
had an outstanding balance of $10,683,000. All of the outstanding balance is classified as long-term debt. In addition to 
the debt, OCIB reported a net position deficit of $997,000 as of June 30, 2018. 
 
The credits and OCIB’s right to transfer the credits expire if not utilized by July 1, 2020. As of June 30, 2018, 
$33,715,000 of tax credits were transferred. Four entities currently have signed agreements to purchase up to an aggregate 
of $8,000,000 of tax credits per year at the sole discretion of OCIB. OCIB has authority to issue up to $20,000,000 of tax 
credits per year with an overall maximum of $100,000,000. The remaining $66,285,000 of tax credits were not considered 
impaired at June 30, 2018, as there is sufficient time remaining for the tax credits to be utilized before they expire. 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 146 

Note 19. Tax Abatements 
 
The State of Oklahoma (state) provides tax abatements under six programs: Historic Rehabilitation tax credits, Quality 
Jobs programs (Quality Jobs, Small Employer and 21st Century), Oklahoma Film Enhancement rebates, the Quality 
Events Program, Small Business Incubators (Sponsors and Tenants) and New Products Development Income Tax 
Exemptions. Tribal compacts with Native American tribes also provide abatements to cigarette tax collections. 
 
The Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credits Program, established by the Legislature – 68 Oklahoma Statute (O.S.) § 2357.41 
– promotes the rehabilitation of historic structures of every period. These credits can be claimed at any time after the 
relevant local governmental body responsible for doing so issues a certificate of occupancy or other document that is a 
precondition for the applicable use of the building or structure. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, estimated tax 
credits in the amount of $37,623,000 were approved for 24 structures. Historic Rehabilitation tax credits used to reduce 
tax liability in 2017 was $7,502,000. 
 
Three quality jobs programs are administered by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce (ODOC) for which the state 
provides incentive payments that are paid from income tax collections: 
 
The Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program was established by the Legislature (68 O.S. § 3601) to provide an incentive for 
companies to expand or relocate jobs to Oklahoma. Companies meeting certain statutory requirements can receive a 
rebate up to 5% of new taxable payroll for up to 10 years. The requirements include creating jobs within a qualifying 
industry as noted by the North American Industry Classification System description; paying wages on the newly created 
jobs equal to the average county wage or state threshold wage, whichever is lower; achieving $2,500,000 in new annual 
taxable payroll within three years; and offering basic health insurance to employees within 180 days of employment. 
Companies can receive up to a 6% rebate if at least 10% of new payroll is comprised of qualified military veterans. 
 
Under certain circumstances, some program requirements may be amended or waived. 
 
A company that participates in the Oklahoma Quality Jobs Program but fails to maintain a business presence in the state 
of Oklahoma within three years of start date must repay all program benefits received and may not re-apply for the 
program for one year following dismissal. 
 
The Small Employer Quality Jobs Program (68 O.S. §3901) was established to provide appropriate incentives to support 
the creation of quality jobs, particularly for small businesses, in basic industries of the state. Companies applying for the 
Small Employer program must have 90 employees or less at the time of application to the program. Rebates under the 
program are received for up to seven years. Program requirements include creating a minimum number of new jobs based 
on the population of the community where the company is located; having 75% out-of-state sales within one year of 
program start date; paying the newly created jobs at 110% of the average county wage; and offering basic health 
insurance within 180 days of employment (the employee must not pay more than 50% of the premium). 
 
The 21st Century Quality Jobs Program (68 O.S. §3911-3920) was established to provide appropriate incentives to attract 
growth industries and sectors to Oklahoma in the 21st century through a policy of rewarding businesses with a highly 
skilled, knowledge-based workforce. The program allows a net benefit rate of up to ten percent of payroll for up to ten 
years and requires at least ten full-time jobs at an annual average wage of the lesser of $95,243 (the state wage, which is 
indexed every year) or 300% of the county’s average wage. Out-of-state sales for the company must be at least 50% for 
most participants. The program targets industries, such as knowledge-based service industries, including professional, 
scientific and technical services; music, film and performing arts; and specialty hospitals. 
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, 96 companies received payments totaling $60,085,000 as part of Quality Jobs 
Programs. 
 
In an effort to increase the attractiveness of Oklahoma as a location for the film industry, the Oklahoma Film 
Enhancement rebate was established by the Legislature (68 O.S. §§ 3621-3626). A rebate, of up to 35% of documented 
expenditures made in Oklahoma directly attributable to the production of film, television production, or television 
commercials, may be paid to the production company. The Oklahoma Film and Music Commission and the Oklahoma 
Tax Commission (OTC) administer the program. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, five film companies were 
rebated corporate income tax amounting to $2,474,000. 
 



 

OKLAHOMA ♦ 147 

The Quality Events Incentive (68 O.S. §4301-4311) was designed to promote certain quality events that have a significant 
positive economic impact. A quality event is a new event of a meeting of a nationally recognized organization, a new or 
existing event that is a national, international or world championship, or a new or existing event that is managed or 
produced by an Oklahoma based national or international organization. The host community must submit a resolution and 
information pertaining to the event (geographic area, length of time for revenue capture, expenses, event history, and 
economic impact) to the OTC within 30 days of the date on which the host community adopts the ordinance or resolution. 
The OTC will then approve or disapprove the impact study. The ODOC and the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation 
Department provide assistance and information, as requested, by the OTC to approve or disapprove an economic impact 
study. 

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, nine events were certified by the Quality Events Incentive Program, and 
$417,000 in sales tax was abated. 

A business incubator is a facility in which small businesses may rent space and where management provides business 
development services, such as financial consulting and marketing assistance. The Small Business Incubators program 
offers tax exemptions for both sponsors (74 O.S. §5075) and tenants (74 O.S. §5078) of business incubators that register 
with ODOC. 

The income of a certified incubator sponsor is exempt from Oklahoma income taxes on income earned from rental fees, 
other income derived from services provided to the tenants, or for providing funding for an incubator site.  

The tenant is exempt from state tax liability on income earned as a result of activities conducted as an occupant in a 
certified incubator for up to ten years from the occupancy date in an incubator site in accordance with rules of the OTC. 
The exemption remains in effect after the date the tenant is no longer an occupant in an incubator, but not to exceed a 
total of ten years. 
 
Reporting for tax exemptions related to business incubator tenants and sponsors is commingled with other tax exemptions 
on the forms provided to the OTC. As a result, it is not possible to determine the amount of tax abated during the fiscal 
year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Under the New Products Development Income Tax Exemption (74 O.S. § 5064.7), royalties earned by an inventor from a 
product developed and manufactured in the state shall be exempt from state income tax for a period of seven years from 
the first year in which such royalty is received as long as the manufacturer remains in the state. In addition, such 
manufacturer may exclude from state taxable income, or in the case of an individual, the state adjusted gross income, 65% 
of the cost of depreciable property purchased and utilized directly in manufacturing the product. To qualify for the 
incentives, the product shall be patented or have patent pending pursuant to federal law and shall be registered with 
Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology. 
 
The reporting for tax exemptions related to New Products Development Income Tax Exemptions is commingled with 
other tax exemptions on the forms provided to OTC. As a result, it is not possible to determine the amount of tax abated 
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Twenty-nine American Indian tribes, governed within the state’s borders, collect cigarette taxes on behalf of the state 
through compact agreements. Only a portion of the taxes are remitted to the state, with the tribe retaining the remainder as 
defined by the compact agreement. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the portion of tax retained by tribes 
ranged from 50-80% and resulted in $46,654,000 of tax abated. 
 
Information relevant to disclosure of those programs for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, is:

Notes to Required Supplementary Information - Budgetary Reporting 
 

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 
 
 

The Budgetary Comparison Schedule - Budget to Actual (Non-GAAP Budgetary Basis) presents comparisons of the 
original and final legally adopted budget with actual data on a budgetary basis. The schedule represents budgetary 
comparisons at the legal level of budgetary control (i.e. line item level). The schedule is prepared on a cash basis plus 
encumbrances where the expenditures are expected to be presented by November 15th in the following fiscal year. Certain 
appropriations are transferred to continuing funds for expenditure. Unexpended amounts may then be budgeted again in 
subsequent fiscal years.  These transfers are not included in the total expenditures on the Budgetary Comparison Schedule 
- Budget to Actual (Non-GAAP Budgetary Basis). 

 
Reconciliation of Budgetary Fund Balance to GAAP Fund Balance 
 
Since accounting principles applied for purposes of developing data on a budgetary basis differ significantly from those 
used to present financial statements in conformity with GAAP, a reconciliation of resulting basis, perspective, and entity 
differences in the revenues in excess of (less than) expenditures and other financing sources (uses) between budgetary and 
GAAP presentations for the year ended June 30, 2018, is presented below (expressed in thousands) for the general fund:

Notes to Schedule: 

GASB Statement 68 requires the information presented in the “Schedules of Required Supplementary Information” cover 
the 10 most recent fiscal years. The information above covers the period retroactive to the adoption of GASB Statement 
68 and is the latest available at the date of publication. 

Actuarially Determined Contributions: 

The annual required contribution for fiscal year 2018 was determined as part of the July 1, 2018, actuarial valuation using 
the individual entry age normal method. The actuarial assumptions included: a) a 7.5% investment rate of return (net of 
administrative expense), b) projected salary increases of 3.50%-9.75%, c) a cost-of-living allowance of 3% for eligible 
participants, and d) an inflation rate of 2.75%. 

Benefit Changes: 

2018:  House Bill 1340 provides for a single, one-time, non-permanent increase in the payment of retirement 
benefits. A single payment of 2% of the gross annual retirement benefit is paid to qualifying members, 
subject to a cap and floor on the payment. This became effective May 8, 2018. 

House Bill 2517 clarifies that all benefits payable from the plan, including payments from deferred option 
plans, shall be paid from general assets of the fund. This became effective April 12, 2018. 

2014: House Bill 2622 reset the amortization period of the unfunded actuarial liability to 15 years effective July 
1, 2014. 

2012: Senate Bill No. 1001 was enacted, which increased the agency contribution to 11% of pay as of November 
1, 2012. In addition, the bill eliminated the half-pay benefit for certain members hired on or after 
November 1, 2012. 

2011: The Oklahoma Pension Legislation Actuarial Analysis Act was modified to change the Definition of non-
fiscal retirement bill and by removing a certain provision that allows a Cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) 
to be considered non-fiscal, thereby requiring that COLAs be concurrently funded by the Legislature at 
the time they are enacted. 

2010: Senate Bill 2130 eliminated the mandatory retirement age of sixty years for members. 

2008: House Bill 3112 provides a 4% COLA for retired members. Senate Bill 565 states that beginning July 1, 
2010, the amount of insurance premium tax revenue apportioned to the System is applied prior to 
calculation of the Home Office Credit. 

2007: Senate Bill 695 brings the System into compliance with IRS requirements as it relates to the direct 
payment of qualified health insurance premiums and the rollover of distributions of a non-spouse 
beneficiary. House Bill 2070 subjects the System to the Oklahoma Pension Legislation Actuarial Analysis 
Act. 

Changes in Actuarial Assumptions: 

July 1, 2017 Valuation: 
• The cost of living assumption was 3% for eligible participants. The inflation assumption was 3%.
• Beginning with the July 1, 2017 valuation, there is a salary experience reserve. When base pay

raises are small or non-existent, the reserve is credited with the liability gain resulting from this
experience. When pay raises are granted, the reserve is released to offset any loss (or completely
released, if less than the loss).

July 1, 2012 Valuation: 
• Healthy mortality was changed from the RP-2000 table with blue collar adjustment (Active rates

before age 50, Annuitant rates after age 49) with generational mortality improvement to the RP-
2000 combined table with blue collar adjustment with generational mortality improvement. 

• The mortality table used for disabled pensioners was changed from RP-2000 table with blue collar
adjustment set forward seven years to RP-2000 combined table with blue collar adjustment. 



OKLAHOMA ♦ 162 

• The retirement, disability, and withdrawal rates were changed. The inflation assumption was
changed from 3.25% to 3.00%. The salary increase assumption was changed.

July 1, 2007 Valuation: 
• The retirement, disability, and withdrawal rates were changed. The salary increase assumption was

changed. The rate of inflation assumption was increased to 3.25% per year. 
• COLA assumption of 4% every other year was added.

2018: House Bill 1340 provides for a single, one-time, non-permanent increase in the payment of retirement 
benefits. A single payment of 2% of the gross annual retirement benefit is paid to qualifying members, 
subject to a cap and floor on the payment. This became effective May 8, 2018. 

2011: With the passage of House Bill 2132 benefits are not assumed to increase due to future ad hoc COLA 
increases. 

Under House Bill 1010, the retirement age for judges taking office on or after January 1, 2012 increases 
from the current age 65 to age 67 with eight years of service. In addition, the current rule of 80 or age 60 
changes to age 62 with 10 or more years of service. 

Senate Bill 782 amends 62 O.S § 3109 to move the deadline for completion of an actuarial investigation 
from November 1 to December 1. The final bill deletes the requirement that the state pension systems 
submit reports annually to the Pension Commission using standard actuarial assumptions. 

2009: Effective July 1, 2009, Senate Bill 212 provides that the funded ratio of the URSJJ should be at or near 
90%. The bill also authorizes the Board of Trustees of the Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement 
System to establish and adjust the employer contribution rate annually up to the actuarially required 
contribution rate. If the increase to the full actuarially required contribution rate is in excess of three 
percent (3%), the Board may adopt a plan to raise the rate to the actuarially required contribution rate over 
a period of up to five (5) years. The board may consider the availability of funds to the administrative 
director of the courts, the Court of Civil Appeals, the Court of Criminal Appeals, and the Workers’ 
Compensation Court in establishing the annual contribution rate. 

House Bill 1254 provides for a payment of $6 million, in addition to the regular employer contributions, 
to be paid into the URSJJ for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2010. 

2008: House Bill 3112 was passed by the 2008 Oklahoma Legislature and included a four percent (4%) COLA 
for members who were retired as of June 30, 2007, and still receiving a benefit as of July 1, 2008. 

Changes in Actuarial Assumptions: 

7/1/2017 valuation: Investment return decreased from 7.25% to 7.00%. Projected salary increases decreased 
from 5.00% to 3.75%. Inflation rate decreased from 3.00% to 2.75%. 

7/1/2016 valuation: Investment return decreased from 7.5% to 7.25% 

7/1/2014 valuation: Salary scale assumption was decreased. Retirement rates were adjusted. 

7/1/2011 valuation: Salary increase assumption was revised. Payroll increase assumption was revised. 

7/1/2008 valuation: Inflation assumption was increased from 2.5% to 3.0%. Investment return was increased 
from 7.25% to 7.5%. General wage growth assumption was set at 4.25%. Retirement rates were increased for 
ages before 65 and rates were lowered for ages above 67. Post-retirement mortality was changed to RP-2000 
combined active/retired healthy mortality table projected to 2010, setback one year. Amortization methodology 
was changed for the unfunded actuarial accrued liability form level dollar to level percent of payroll. The board 
reset the amortization period to 20 years from July 1, 2007. The previous amortization period was 40 years from 
July 1, 1987.

The statistical section of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) presents detailed information as a context 
for understanding what the information in the financial statements, note disclosures and required supplementary 
information says about the state’s overall financial health. The information is grouped into the following five categories:

These schedules contain trend information to help the reader understand how the state’s financial performance and well-
being have changed over time. 
 
Revenue Capacity – Personal Income by Industry, Personal Income Tax Filers and Liability by Adjusted Gross Income, 
and Tax Collections  
 
These schedules contain information to help the reader assess the ability of the state to generate and collect taxes.  
 
Debt Capacity – Percentage of Annual Debt Service Expenditures for General Bonded Debt to Total Expenditures, 
Ratios of Outstanding Debt by Type, and Revenue Bond Coverage 
 
These schedules present information to help the reader assess the affordability of the state’s current levels of outstanding 
debt, its ability to issue additional debt in the future, and its ability to repay the outstanding debt.  
 
Demographic and Economic Information – Major Employers by Size, Demographic and Economic Statistics, and 
School Enrollments 
 
These schedules offer demographic and economic indicators to help the reader understand the environment within which 
the state’s financial activities take place and to help make comparisons over time and with other governments.

Indicators for Governmental Functions, and Additional Information and Sources of Statistical Data 
 
These schedules contain information about the state’s operations and resources to help the reader understand how the
