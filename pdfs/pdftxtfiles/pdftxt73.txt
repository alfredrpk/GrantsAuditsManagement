INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 

To the Board of Education 
Edmond Independent School District No. 12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma  
Edmond, Oklahoma  
 
Report on the Financial Statements  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major 
fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Edmond Independent School District No.12, 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in 
the table of contents.   
Management’s Responsibility of the Financial Statements  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education 
described in Note 1; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  
As described in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by Edmond Independent School District 
No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma 
State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of Oklahoma 
State Department of Education. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the 
regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  
In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion 
on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in 
the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America, the financial position of Edmond Independent School District No.12, 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position for the year 
then ended. 
Unmodified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting  
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material 
respects, the respective financial position on a regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each 
major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Edmond Independent School District 
No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in regulatory 
basis financial position thereof for the year then ended, in accordance with the financial reporting 
provisions of Oklahoma State Department of Education as described in Note 1.  
Other Matters  
Other Information  
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the Edmond Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s 
basic financial statements as a whole. The management discussion and analysis, budgetary comparison 
schedules, combining nonmajor fund financial statements, statement of changes in activity fund 
subaccounts and statement of statutory fidelity and honesty bonds are presented for purposes of 
additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The accompanying 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required 
by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic 
financial statements.  
The combining nonmajor fund financial statements, statement of changes in activity fund subaccounts 
and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the responsibility of management and were 
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the 
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in 
the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, 
the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

This section of Edmond Public Schools Independent School District No.12's annual financial report 
presents our discussion and analysis of the District's financial performance during the fiscal year that 
ended on June 30, 2018.  Please read it in conjunction with the District's financial statements, which 
immediately follow this section. 
 
VIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
This annual report consists of three parts -- management's discussion and analysis (this section), the 
basic financial statements, and required supplementary information.  The basic financial statements 
include two kinds of statements that present different views of the District: 
 

 The first two statements are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and 
long-term information about the District's overall financial status. 

 
 The remaining statements are fund regulatory financial statements that focus on individual 

parts of the District, reporting the District's operations in more detail than the district-wide 
statements. 

 
 The governmental funds statements tell how basic services like regular and special education 

were financed in the short term as well as what remains for future spending. 
 
The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and 
provide more detailed data.  The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary 
information that further explains and supports the financial statements with a comparison of the 
District's budget for the year. 
 
The financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements 
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma Department of Education as more fully 
described in Note 1 to the financial statements. 
 
Figure A-1 summarizes the major features of the District's financial statements.  The remainder of this 
overview section of management's discussion and analysis highlights the structure and contents of each 
of the statements.

District-wide Statements 
 
The district-wide statements report information about the District as a whole using accounting methods 
similar to those used by private-sector companies.  The statement of net assets includes all of the 
District's capital assets and long-term liabilities. 
 
The two district-wide statements report the District's net position.  Net position - the difference 
between the District's assets and liabilities - is one way to measure the District's financial health or 
position. 
 

 Over time, increases or decreases in the District's net assets are an indicator of whether its 
financial position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 
 

 To assess the overall health of the District, you need to consider additional non-financial 
factors such as changes in the District's property tax base and the condition of school buildings 
and other facilities. 

 
In the district-wide financial statements, the District's activities are categorized as governmental 
activities. 
 
Governmental activities - Most of the District's basic services are included here, such as regular and 
special education, transportation, and administration.  Property taxes and state aid finance most of 
these activities.

Fund Financial Statements 
 
The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District's funds, focusing on 
its most significant or "major" funds - not the District as a whole.  Funds are accounting devices the 
District uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs: 
 

 Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants. 
 

 The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like 
repaying its long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues. 

 
Most of the District's basic services are included in governmental funds, which generally focus on 1) 
how cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in and out and 2) the 
balances left at year-end that are available for spending.  Consequently, the governmental funds 
statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps you determine whether there are more or 
fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the District's programs.  
Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-wide 
statements, we provide additional information with the governmental funds statements that explain the 
relationship (or differences) between them.

Changes	in	Net	Position	

In 2018 the District’s revenues increased $8.2 million from the prior year (See Table A-3).  The most 
significant variance from the prior year was in property taxes.  Revenue from property taxes increased 
$6.8 million over the prior year.  This increase resulted from an increase of 4.5% in the District’s 
property valuation from $1.856 billion to $1.939 billion and an increase in the millage rate from 66.34 
mills to 67.08 mills.  The millage rate varies from year to year because of the changing sinking fund 
levy as old bonds are retired and new bonds are added.  When planning bond elections, the District 
strives to maintain the millage rates as level as possible within the range of 66.26 to 67.26 mills. 

The largest component of other general revenues is investment income.  Continued increases in interest 
rates more than doubled investment earnings over the prior year from $973,000 to $2.2 million 
government-wide.  Additionally, there were increases in premium and accrued interest on issuance of 
bonds of $390,000.  Together these account for $1.4 million of the $1.6 million increase in other 
general revenues. 

Other taxes increased $1 million over the prior year, primarily from a $626,000 increase in motor 
vehicle collections and a $295,000 increase in county 4-mill collections.  In 2018, the method of 
allocating motor vehicle collections was changed by statute to be based on a school district’s prior year 
average daily attendance rather than funding the prior year amount as a floor.  Even though the 
percentage of motor vehicle taxes going to schools is capped, the new allocation method will produce 
higher revenue to growing school districts such as Edmond.  County 4-mill is also allocated based on 
prior year average daily attendance, so our increased collections are partly due to increased property 
valuations and partly due to growing enrollment. 

Overall program revenues decreased $900,000 from the prior year, which is a combination of 
decreases in charges for services and decreases in federal and state grants. The decrease in charges for 
services of $200,000 is attributable to student clubs and organizations with the largest portion derived 
from band, orchestra, and vocal music collections which were higher in the prior year due to 
collections for a trip to London which was taken in December 2017.  Decreases in federal and state 
grants of $700,000 result partially because prior year collections were inflated due to collections of 
delayed 2016 claims in 2017 and partially because of non-recurring grant revenue in 2017 that was not 
repeated in 2018. 

State entitlement revenues decreased by $300,000. This represents the net of an increase of $941,000 
in health insurance funding and a decrease of $1.2 million in state aid to schools. The health insurance 
increase was due to a combination of a premium increase of 4.2% and a slight increase in participation.  
The state aid to schools is allocated based on weighted students through an equalization formula that 
reduces state funding to a school district by the funding received through local tax collections and 
certain state revenues dedicated to education.  Despite a 2.0% increase in the weighted student count 
and an increase in the funding factor of $26.20 per student, Edmond experienced a state aid decrease 
due to increased local and dedicated revenues which serve to reduce state aid funding. 

Program expenses increased $10.0 million. Approximately 86% of the increase was in the areas of 
instruction and support services. The remaining increase of 14% is largely due to increased bond

activity, to include spending bond proceeds to construct and equip facilities, increased depreciation 
expense, and debt service costs.  

The increase in instructional program expense was $2.9 million which primarily consisted of a $2.6 
million increase in personnel costs (reinstatement of one contract day that was cut in the prior year plus 
new positions and pay raises) and a $2.2 million increase in technology supplies (largely student 
Chromebooks and iPads), offset by a net decrease in textbooks of $1.6 million (decrease in state 
textbooks of $3.2 million netted with an increase in supplemental textbooks of $1.6 million).  Other 
significant variances from the prior year include decreases of $115,000 for instruments and $102,000 
in professional education contract services. 

Expenditures for support services increased by $5.7 million, which primarily consisted of a $2.5 
million increase in support personnel costs due to reinstatement of one contract day that was cut in the 
prior year as well as new positions and pay increases.  Also, spending for technology related supplies 
increased $1.2 million, student travel expenses increased $1.0 million (included was the student trip to 
London in December 2017), repairs and maintenance increased $767,000, registrations for staff 
professional development increased $183,000, property insurance increased $152,000, small 
equipment and furniture purchases increased $143,000, and extracurricular supplies increased 
$142,000.  Electricity expense decreased $258,000 and security services decreased $92,000. 

Non-instruction expenses overall did not fluctuate much from the prior year.  There was a decrease in 
food and milk purchases of $248,000 as a result of fewer serving days (nine teacher walk-out days and 
two snow days, offset by the add-back of one contract day which was cut in the prior year).   However, 
offsetting much of those savings were increases in payroll, repairs and maintenance, temporary 
staffing, and small kitchen appliances, tools, and supplies. 

Interest costs increased $300,000 over the prior year due to higher balances in bonds outstanding and 
increased interest rates on the more recent bond issues. 

Depreciation expense increased $1.1 million due to capital asset construction and acquisition. 

FINANCIAL	ANALYSIS	OF	THE	DISTRICT'S	FUNDS	

The financial performance of the District’s funds are reflected in the balance sheet for governmental 
funds report on page 16.  The District’s balance sheet for all funds reflects a combined fund balance of 
$123.8 million, an increase of $7.5 million over the prior year.  The overall increase is attributed to a 
$5.2 million increase in the general fund, a $662,000 increase in the building fund, a $2.3 million 
increase in the capital project funds (bond funds), a $461,000 increase in the debt service fund, and a 
$75,000 increase in the gift fund, offset by decreases of $978,000 in the activity fund and $179,000 in 
the child nutrition fund. 
 

General	Fund	Budgetary	Highlights	for	2018	

Following the 2017 year of collection shortfalls and funding cuts, the 2017 legislature passed revenue 
measures for 2018 to fill a $900 million budget hole.  The District’s conservative 2018 budget

reflected the uncertainty bred by the prior years’ funding cuts and the unproven revenue sources for the 
current year.  Even so, the District’s budget met the objectives of maintaining class sizes, meeting the 
personnel demands needed to accommodate student enrollment growth, and restoring some prior 
budget cuts, starting with the contract day that was cut in 2017.  State general revenue fund collections 
in the first half of 2018 were below projections, creating a statutory revenue failure which required 
budget cuts for the third successive year.  The State’s declared revenue failure in the general revenue 
fund reduced the state aid appropriation by $16.2 million.  All other state funding for education was 
funded at the original appropriations.  During the second half of the year, state collections began to 
recover due to improvements in the economy and the effect of budget measures passed by the 
legislature for 2018.  Conservative budgeting and the state’s recovery caused the District to experience 
positive budget variances in both revenue and expenditures, which resulted in an increase in general 
fund balance over the prior year and over projections. 
 
In the general fund, local revenue increased consistent with the increase in property valuations in the 
District.  Additionally, collection of delinquent taxes produced a $327,000 favorable budget variance. 
Motor vehicle collections contributed another $455,000 positive budget variance.  Because there were 
no state aid cuts in the fourth quarter of the year as were anticipated in the budget, there was a positive 
variance of $1.6 million in state aid allocations. 
 
Employee wages and benefits continue to comprise the largest portion of the expenditure budget.  
Total 2018 payroll cost was $137.7 million, 96.7% of the District’s total general fund expenditures.  
This represents an increase of $5.0 million over the prior year.  The increase is primarily due to 
restoring one contract day, step and salary increases for existing personnel, and new and restored 
positions necessitated by enrollment growth.  General fund expenditures were 74.3% instruction and 
student services, 6.2% facilities operations, 6.4% school administration, 4.6% student transportation, 
4.8% food service and before/after care (reimbursable by those programs), 2.4% central services and 
1.3% general administration. 
 
 
CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 
Capital Assets 
During 2018, the District completed $42.3 million in construction projects, including completion of 
Heartland Middle School Phases 1 and 2, Sunset Elementary addition/renovation, Frontier Elementary 
Phase 3, and Heritage Elementary Phase 3.  Also completed were audio-visual improvements at the 
administration center. 
 
On June 30, 2018, the District had bond funds available, including accumulated interest, of $78.9 
million, which will be spent on capital projects including a tennis center in conjunction with the City of 
Edmond; additions of classrooms, band rooms, media centers, and gymnasiums which will dual 
purpose as storm shelters; site renovations; parking and road improvements; football stadium and track 
upgrades at Memorial high school; and instructional, technology and transportation equipment.  
Accumulated bond fund interest accounted for $3.3 million of the bond funds available. 
 
Edmond North High School football stadium opened September 2017.

Long-term Debt 
At fiscal year end, the District had $166.1 million in total long-term debt outstanding.  This is a net 
increase of $8.2 million from last year’s amount of $157.9 million.  The District issued new bonds 
totaling $50.9 million and retired $42.7 million of outstanding bonds. 
 
In February 2017, voters in the District approved the issuance of bonds totaling $111,000,000, to be 
issued in four series over a two-year period.  The issuance plan minimized fluctuations in patrons’ 
taxes and also staggered construction requirements.  The first installment in the amount of $37,580,000 
was issued in March 2017, and the second installment of $20,000,000 was issued in August 2017. The 
third installment of $30,900,000 was issued in March 2018, and the fourth installment of $22,520,000 
was issued in August 2018. 
 
This election supported the second phase of a multi-year plan to meet space demands of enrollment 
growth while also providing storm shelters in all of our schools.  These shelter spaces will be 
classrooms, media centers, gymnasiums, multi-purpose rooms, and a band room as determined by the 
particular needs of each school.  In addition to securing funding to complete the shelter plan, this bond 
election extended football stadium upgrades to the remaining high schools as well as provided 
continued financial support for technology, roofing, flooring, HVAC, school safety and security, and 
school equipment. 
 
On February 12, 2019, the District will be asking voters to approve $93.0 million in bonds to be issued

FACTORS BEARING ON THE DISTRICT'S FUTURE 
 
The 2018 legislative session was historic for education in Oklahoma.  Successive years of budget cuts 
and teacher shortages pushed teachers into advocacy.  In response to an impending teacher walkout, 
legislators approved a substantial teacher pay raise and the tax measures necessary to fund it.  The 
teacher pay raise ranged from $5,001 to $8,815, depending on placement on the salary schedule with 
$6,100 being the average raise.  Raises for school support personnel of $1,250 per full time employee 
were also legislated.  The funding bill for 2019 also restored textbook funding which had been 
eliminated in the two prior years.  New taxes that were passed to fund the pay increases included a

$1.00 per pack cigarette tax, a fuel tax of $.03 per gallon for gasoline and $.06 for diesel, a gross 
production tax rate increase from 2% to 5%, and an income tax increase from capping itemized 
deductions. 
 
All of this was great news coming from three consecutive years of revenue failures and reduced state 
allocations when revenue shortfalls created net funding cuts to education of $34.2 million in 2016, 
$93.4 million in 2017 and $16.2 million in 2018.  Shortly after the 2018 appropriation cuts, state 
revenue collections began to improve.  There are now solid signs of economic recovery with increases 
in all revenue streams, even when excluding the new tax revenue from the monthly growth calculation.  
State unemployment is down to 3.4% which is less than the federal unemployment rate and the lowest 
for the state since July 2017.  Interest rates have been on the rise, with short term rates earned in the 
District’s general fund more than doubling from an average of .62% in 2017 to 1.27% in 2018. 
 
Local property growth, both residential and commercial, in Edmond is still strong.  Property valuation 
is anticipated to increase an average of 2.5% to 3% over the next two years. 
 
A plaintiff group won a lawsuit against the Oklahoma Tax Commission over the allocation method 
used for motor vehicle taxes when guaranteed prior year collections for the month could not be paid.  
The original lawsuit did not seek to recoup past amounts, and the state law changed for 2018 making 
the new allocation method permanent.  In November 2018, the same plaintiff group filed another 
lawsuit asking for redistribution of amounts from the 13 months affected before the law change.  The 
plaintiffs prevailed in that suit.  The resulting redistribution would reduce the District’s future 
collections by $2.4 million over thirteen months.  Possible challenges could delay or stay 
implementation of the reallocation.  It should be noted, however, that because motor vehicle 
collections are equalized through the state aid formula, the effect on District revenue will be a timing 
difference.  Reduced motor vehicle collections in the current year will produce an equal increase in 
state aid collections in the following year by function of the state aid formula. 
 
Enrollment growth is projected at the rate of about 350 to 400 students per year over the next couple of 
years.

Amounts reported for governmental activities
 in the statement of activities are different because:

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds 7,548,411$       

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in governmental funds as expenditures.
However, for governmental activities those costs are shown in the statement allocated over their estimated
useful lives as annual depreciation expense in the statement of activities. Capital Outlay 40,245,444$      
This is the amount by which capital outlays exceeds depreciation during the period. Depreciation Expense (13,802,529)       26,442,915       

In the statement of activities, the gain from the disposal of assets is reported. In the governmental funds, proceeds from the 
disposal of assets, if any, are reported. Thus the change in net position differs by the net underpreciated 
costs of the assets disposed. (18,929)            

In the statement of activities, compensated absences are measured by the amounts earned during the year. 
In the governmental funds, however, expenditures for these items are measured by the amount of financial resources 
used (essentially the amounts actually paid). This year, vacation and sick leave earned exceeded amounts used. (39,659)            

Bond proceeds are reported as financing sources in governmental funds and thus contribute to the change
in fund balance. In the statement of net position, however, issuing debt increases long-term liabilities and
does not affect the statement of activities.  Similarly, repayment of principal is an
expenditure in the governmental funds but reduces the liability in the statement of
net position. Debt issued this year exceeded repayments. Debt Issued (50,900,000)$     

Debt Repayments 42,685,000        (8,215,000)       

The receipt of USDA commodities are not reported as revenue in the governmental funds 
but are reflected in the  government-wide financial statements (28,159)            

Resources provided in the debt service fund in accordance with Oklahoma Statute 62-431 are 
not a liability at the district-wide level but considered a component of restricted net assets 2,864,393

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The Reporting Entity - The Edmond Independent School District No. 12 (the District) is a corporate 
body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a separate 
entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the public school system of 
Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially 
dependent on the State of Oklahoma for support.  The general operating authority for the public school 
system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  There are no component units 
included within the reporting entity. 
 
Financial Statement Presentation - The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation 
format that is, in substance, the format established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB) Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statement-Management’s Discussion and Analysis-for 
State and Local Governments. 
 
GASB Statement No. 34 established a financial reporting model for state and local governments that 
included the addition of management’s discussion and analysis, government-wide financial statements, 
required supplementary information and the elimination of the effects of internal service activities and 
the use of account groups to the already required fund financial statements and notes. 
 
Basic Financial Statements – Government-Wide Statements - The District’s basic financial statements 
include both government-wide (reporting the District as a whole) and fund financial statements 
(reporting the District’s major funds). Both the government-wide and fund financial statements 
categorize primary activities as either governmental or business type. The District does not have any 
activities classified as business-type activities. 
 
In the government-wide Statement of Net Position, the District’s governmental activities are reported 
on cash receipts and disbursement basis modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma 
Department of Education to include long-term debt and obligations. The District’s net position is 
reported in three parts – invested in capital assets, net of related debt; restricted net position; and 
unrestricted net position.  
 
The government-wide Statement of Activities reports both the gross and net cost of each of the 
District’s programs and functions.  The functions are also supported by general government revenues. 
The Statement of Activities reduces gross expenses (including depreciation) by related program 
revenues, operating and capital grants. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a 
specific function.  Program revenues must be directly associated with the function.  Charges for 
services include charges and fees to students, or customers who purchase, use or directly benefit from 
the goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function. Operating grants include operating-
specific and discretionary (either operating or capital) grants while the capital grants column reflects 
capital-specific grants.

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Basic Financial Statements – Government-Wide Statements 
 
All interfund transactions are eliminated in the district-wide statements.  
 
The net costs are normally covered by general revenue (property taxes, State and Federal aid, other 
taxes etc.). 
 
The government-wide focus is more on the sustainability of the District as an entity and the change in 
the District’s net position resulting from the current year’s activities. Separate financial statements are 
provided for governmental funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter is excluded from the 
district-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental funds are reported in separate 
columns in the fund financial statements. 
 
Basic Financial Statements – Fund Financial Statements - Governmental fund financial statements are 
reported using the cash receipts and disbursements basis of accounting modified as required by the 
Oklahoma Department of Education to include investments and inventories on hand, encumbrances 
issued, and warrants outstanding.  The fund financial statements provide reports on the financial 
condition and results of operations of governmental and fiduciary fund categories on a basis required 
by the cash basis and budget laws of the State of Oklahoma. Since resources in the fiduciary funds 
cannot be used for District operations, they are not included in the district-wide statements. 
 
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 
 
General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all financial 
resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
 
Debt Service Fund is used to account for the accumulation of funds for the periodic payment of 
principal and interest on general long-term debt. 
 
2016A  and 2017A Bond Funds are used to account for the proceeds from long-term financing and 
revenues and expenditures related to authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions. 
 
Additionally, the District reports the following fund types which are included in other 
governmental funds: 
 
Governmental Funds: 

1. Special Revenue Funds – The District accounts for resources 
committed to, or designated for, specific purposes by the District 
or a grantor in a special revenue fund. 

2. Capital Projects Funds – The proceeds from long-term financing 
and revenues and expenditures related to authorized construction 
and other capital asset acquisitions are accounted for in a capital 
projects fund.

organizations. These funds are primarily used for scholarships 

 
Basis of Accounting - Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in 
the accounts and reported in the financial statements. It relates to the timing of the measurements made 
regardless of the measurement focus applied. 
 
As to the basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash 
receipts and disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma Department of 
Education as follows: 
 

 Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the 
expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

 Vendor obligations due and payable for goods and services received are recorded as a 
reduction of the encumbrance when received and a payable until paid. 

 Warrants/Checks payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
 Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased and reduced when used. 
 Capital assets in the government-wide statements are recorded when acquired and 

depreciated over their useful lives. 
 Long-term debt reported in the government-wide statements is recorded when incurred. 
 Financial resources provided in the debt service fund in accordance with Oklahoma Statute 

62-431 are reported as fund liabilities.  In the government-wide statements, these resources 
are shown as restricted net position. 

 Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 
obligation is incurred. 

 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America, which would have required the government-wide financial statements as well as the 
fiduciary fund financial statements to be presented on the accrual basis of accounting.  The fund 
financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 
would have been presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting.  These financial statements are 
presented on the basis of accounting described above. 
 
Inventories - Inventories consist of expendable supplies held for the District’s use and are carried at 
cost using the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are accounted for using the consumption method 
where materials and supplies are recorded as an asset when purchased. 
 
On the government-wide financial statements, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) food 
commodities are recorded as revenue when received at fair value at the date of receipt and as an 
expense when used. USDA food commodities are not reported in the governmental funds.

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 
Capital Assets - Capital assets purchased or acquired with an original cost of $2,500 or more are 
reported at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Additions, improvements and other capital 
outlays that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized.  
 
Other costs incurred for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation on all assets is 
provided on the straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives: 
 

School Buildings 45 years 
 Site Improvements 20 years 
 Portable Classrooms 25 years 
 Outdoor and Grounds Equipment 15 years 
 Kitchen Equipment 10 years 
 Audio Visual Equipment, Musical Instruments, 
    Business Machines, Classroom and Athletic Equipment 10 years 
 Computers and Peripheral Equipment  5 years 
 Licensed Vehicles  6 years 
  
Compensated Absences –Certified and permanent personnel are entitled to one day of sick leave for 
each working month, with the total annual leave allotment being available on the first day of the 
employee’s work year.  New support employees accrue sick leave at the rate of one day per month, 
with leave being available after accrual.  As an attendance incentive, employees are compensated $35 
per day for full-time, or $17.50 per day for part-time, for up to 10 days of sick leave accumulated in 
excess of 110 days at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
Employees assigned to twelve month positions accrue 10 days of vacation per year for the first 4 years 
of employment, 15 days beginning with the 5th through 14th year of employment, and 18 days 
beginning with the 15th year of employment.  Upon termination of employment, unused accrued 
vacation is paid at the employee's current rate of pay.  
 
Budgets and Budgetary Accounting - The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.  
No later than October 1, each board of education shall prepare a financial statement and estimate of 
needs to be filed with the applicable county clerk and the State Department of Education.  Once the 
county excise board has approved the estimate of needs, the board shall adopt a final budget within 45 
days or the second regularly scheduled board meeting.   
 
The final budget may be revised upon approval of the Board of Education in open meeting. 
 
A budget that includes revenues and expenditures is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the 
General Fund, Building Fund, Child Nutrition and the Debt Service Fund.

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
Budgets and Budgetary Accounting (continued) 
 
Budgets generally assume the expenditure of all available resources. Therefore, when the legal budget 
is prepared, it is assumed these funds will not have a carryover balance to a subsequent year.  Program 
revenue received but not spent is deferred to the subsequent fiscal year. 
 
Deposits - The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits, money market checking, sweep 
accounts, and bank certificates of deposit which are subject to early withdrawal penalties no matter 
what the maturity period, to be cash.  All short-term cash surpluses are maintained in a cash pool, the 
earnings from which are allocated to each fund based on average monthly deposit balances.  State 
statutes require collateral for deposits in excess of insured amounts.  The collateral’s market value 
must exceed the uninsured deposit. 
 
Investments - Short term investments are reported at cost.  Securities traded on a national exchange are 
valued at cost, adjusted for amortization of interest coupons, if applicable.  The District’s investment 
policies are governed by Oklahoma Statute 70-5-115.  Permissible investments include direct 
obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan 
associations and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and 
loan associations and trust companies. 
 
Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist 
of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The county assessor, upon receipt 
of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for 
submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax 
collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1. 
The second half is due prior to April 1. 
 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 1. Second 
half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. If not paid by the 
following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two 
years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end of two years the 
owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property. 
 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the 
state aid formula under the provisions of Oklahoma Statute 70-18. The State Board of Education 
administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from 
the districts.  Approximately 38% of the District’s general fund revenue comes from state sources. 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of 
Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by 
review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when 
the adjustment is made.

Note 1 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
State Revenues (continued)  
 
The District receives revenue from the State to administer certain categorical educational programs. 
State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only 
for the programs for which the money is provided and require that any money not expended as of the 
close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same 
categorical programs. The State Department of Education requires that categorical educational 
program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 
 
Interfund Transfers - During the course of normal operations, the District has transactions between 
funds including reimbursement of expenditures made on behalf of another fund and transfers of 
resources to provide services and purchase assets.  Transactions that are normal and recurring between 
funds are recorded as operating transfers. 
 
Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets 
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Net Position and Fund Balance –  
 
District-Wide Financial Statements –  
 
Net position on the Statement of Net Position includes the following: 
 

Net Investment in Capital Assets – The component of net position that 
reports the difference between capital assets less both the accumulated 
depreciation and the outstanding balance of debt, excluding unspent 
proceeds, that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or 
improvement of these capital assets. 
 
Restricted for Debt Service – The component of net position that reports the 
amount of funds restricted for payment of principal and interest on debt.  
This amount is restricted by bond indentures. 
 
Restricted for Buildings – The component of net position that reports the 
excess of property taxes and other revenue collected in excess of expenses 
for operation of the District’s buildings. This amount is restricted by state 
law. 
 
Restricted for School Organizations – The component of net position that 
reports the assets restricted for use by student organizations and 
extracurricular activities.  This amount is restricted by regulations of the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education.

Net Position and Fund Balance (continued) 

 
Restricted for Child Nutrition – The component of net position restricted for 
use by the child nutrition fund.  This amount is restricted by regulations of 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education. 
 
Restricted for Private Grants – The component of the net position restricted 
for use as specified in the original grant documents when grant was awarded. 
This amount is restricted by original grantor.    
 
Unrestricted – The difference between assets and liabilities that is not 
reported as restricted for any particular purpose. 
 

When the District incurs an expense for which it may use either restricted or unrestricted net position, 
it uses restricted net position first unless unrestricted net position will have to be returned because it 
was not used.  
 
Fund Financial Statements–  
 
The governmental fund financial statements present fund balances based on classifications that 
comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to honor constraints 
on the specific purposes for which amounts in the respective governmental funds can be spent. The 
classifications used in the governmental fund financial statements are as follows: 

Nonspendable: This classification includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) 
not in spendable form or (b) are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. The 
District has classified Inventories as being nonspendable as these items are not expected to be 
converted to cash within the next year. Endowment principal is non-spendable by terms of the 
endowment bequest. 

Restricted: This classification includes amounts for which constraints on the use of the resources 
are either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through a debt covenant), grantors, 
contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or (b) imposed by law through 
constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The District has classified school bond proceeds 
as being restricted because their use is restricted by state statute or legislation regarding use of 
expenditures. The building fund balance is restricted by state statute to capital outlay and property 
maintenance. Debt service resources are restricted by debt covenant to servicing general obligation 
bonds. Federal and state program revenues and gift fund grants are restricted by the granting 
agencies to program-specific expenditures. Endowment earnings are restricted for scholarship 
purposes by the contributor for scholarship purposes.

Net Position and Fund Balance (continued) 

 
Committed: This classification includes amounts that can be used only for specific purposes 
pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. These amounts cannot 
be used for any other purpose unless the Board of Education removes or changes the specified use 
by taking the same type of action (resolution) that was employed when the funds were initially 
committed. This classification also includes contractual obligations to the extent that existing 
resources have been specifically committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements. 
The District has classified child nutrition and school program activities as being committed 
because their use is directed by the Board of Education. 
 
Assigned: This classification includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s intent to be 
used for a specific purpose but are neither restricted nor committed. This intent can be expressed 
by the Board of Education or through the Board of Education delegating this responsibility to 
management through the budgetary process. The District has assigned general funds for employee 
compensation, site budget carryover, anticipated federal program carryover and appropriated 
budget. Bond fund earnings other than bond proceeds (primarily investment earnings) are assigned 
for bond costs and expenditures consistent with those restricted by bond proposition. 
 
Unassigned: This classification includes the residual fund balance for the general fund. The 
unassigned classification would also include any negative residual fund balance of any other 
governmental fund that cannot be eliminated by offsetting of assigned fund balance amounts. The 
District does not have a formal stabilization arrangement regarding minimum funding 
requirements.  

 
The District would typically use restricted fund balances first, followed by committed resources, and 
then assigned resources, as appropriate opportunities arise, but reserves the right to selectively spend 
unassigned resources first to defer the use of these other classified funds.

Note 2 -- Cash and Investments 
 
Investments – The District’s investment policies are governed by state statute.  Permissible 
investments include direct obligations of the United States Government, its agencies and 
instrumentalities; obligations guaranteed by the State of Oklahoma; repurchase agreements 
collateralized by federal or state investments identified above; deposits in banks and savings and loan 
associations which are collateralized or insured by FDIC or FSLIC; county, municipal and school 
district ad valorem bonds; money market mutual funds regulated by the SEC and consisting of 
investments identified above; warrants, bonds or judgments of the school district; qualified pooled 
investment programs consisting of investments identified above and governed through an interlocal 
cooperative agreement, and investment programs administered by the State Treasurer.  
 
The District maintains cash and investment pools available for use by all funds. Each fund’s portion of 
the pool is displayed on the governmental fund balance sheet. 
 
Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the District’s deposits may not be 
returned to it.  State statutes require collateral for amounts in excess of federally insured amounts.  The 
deposit policy for custodial credit risk requires compliance with the provision of state law. At June 30, 
2018, the bank balance of deposits and cash pools was completely covered by federal depository 
insurance and by collateral held by the District’s third party agent in the District’s name. 
 
Interest Rate Risk - The District does not have a formal policy that limits investment maturities as a 
means of managing its exposure to fair value losses from increasing interest rates. 
 
Credit Risk –Investments – Credit risk is the risk that the issuer or other counterparty to an investment 
will not fulfill its obligations.  The District does not have a formal policy limiting its exposure arising 
from concentration of investments. 
 
At June 30, 2018 the District held U.S. Government agency investments in the following:

Judgments that were awarded against the District for obligations from prior years were purchased from 
the plaintiffs as investments of the general fund. The original judgment amounts totaling $21,245 are 
levied in the sinking fund ratably over three years at a statutory interest rate set annually.  As of June 
30, 2018 the balance to collect was $6,882.  The interest rates are from 5.25 to 5.50%.

Note 3 -- Long-term Liabilities (continued) 
 
State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be 
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved 
by the voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to 
be fully paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue. General obligation bonded debt of the 
District is limited by state law to 10% of the assessed valuation of the District. The legal debt limit at 
June 30, 2018 is approximately $193,871,000. 
 
Proceeds of general obligation bond issues are recorded in the Capital Projects Fund and at least 85% 
of the proceeds are restricted to the use for which they were approved in the bond elections.  
 
Pledged Revenues – Property tax revenues collected by the District are pledged to repay the District’s 
General Obligation Bonds. The principal and interest paid on general obligations with the pledged 
revenues in current year was $42,685,000 and $3,070,113, respectively.  As of June 30, 2018, 
$166,100,000 general obligations were outstanding and $22,520,000 of general obligations bonds were 
authorized but not issued. Subsequent to year end the District issued an additional $22,520,000 of voter 
approved general obligation bonds.  
 
Note 4 -- Employee Retirement System 
 
Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma 
Plan Description - The District contributes to the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement 
System ("TRS"), a cost-sharing, multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system.  
The System is administered by a board of trustees. TRS provides retirement, disability and death 
benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statute 70-17 assigns the authority to 
establish and amend benefit provisions to the TRS Board of Trustees. The System issues a publicly 
available report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for TRS. 
That report may be obtained by contacting the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System. 
 
Benefits Provided – The System provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final 
compensation, age, and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon 
disability and to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O.S. Sec. 17-105 defines all 
retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the State 
Legislature. Benefit provisions include: 

 Members who began contributions prior to November 1, 2017 become 100% vested in 
benefits earned to date after five years of credited service. The vesting term for 
members who began contributions on or after November 1, 2017 is seven years.   

 Members who joined the System prior to July 1, 1992 are eligible to retire at maximum 
benefits at the earlier of age 62 or when age and years of creditable service total 80. 
Members joining from July 1, 1992 to October 31, 2011 are eligible for maximum 
benefits at the earlier of age 62 or when their age and years of creditable service total 
90. Members who joined the System on or after November 1, 2011 are eligible to retire 
with maximum benefits at the earlier of age 65 or when their age and years of creditable 
service total 90 as long as their age is at least 60.

Note 4 -- Employee Retirement System (continued) 
 

 The maximum retirement benefit is 2% of final average compensation times the number 
of years of credited service. Reduced benefits are available at age 55 for members 
joining prior to November 1, 2011 or age 60 for members joining after October 31, 
2011. Reduction factors vary depending on age and date of membership when joining 
the System.   

 Final average compensation for members who joined the System prior to July 1, 1992 is 
defined as the average salary for three highest years of contributing compensation. For 
members joining the System after June 30, 1992 final average compensation is defined 
as the average of the five highest consecutive years of contributing compensation.  Prior 
to July 1, 1995 all contributions were limited to salary caps of $40,000 or $25,000 
depending on the member’s election.  Salary caps were removed starting July 1, 1995.  

 Upon death, the designated beneficiary of a member who has not retired shall receive 
total contributions plus 100% of interest earned through the end of the fiscal year, with 
interest rates varying based on time of service. The surviving spouse may elect to 
receive the retirement benefit of the member, in lieu of the aforementioned benefits.  

 Upon death of a retired member, the System will pay $5,000 to the designated 
beneficiary in addition to the benefits provided by the retirement option selected by the 
member. 

 A member is eligible for disability benefits after 10 years of credited Oklahoma service. 
The disability benefit is equal to 2% of final average compensation for the applicable 
years of credited service.  

 Upon withdrawal from the system, a member’s contributions are refundable with 
interest, based on the years of service. 

 
 
Funding Policy –Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and 
the participating employees. Participation is required for all teachers and other certified employees and 
is optional for all other regular employees of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours 
per week.  
 
The contribution rates for the District and its employees, which are not actuarially determined, are 
established by statute and applied to the employee's earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  The 
District is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable compensation for the year ended June 
30, 2018. Plan members are required to contribute 7% of their annual covered salary. The District pays 
full-time employees’ contributions as allowed by statute.  
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, qualifying employee contributions were reduced by a retirement 
credit of $972,441 as provided in state statute and paid by the State of Oklahoma as on-behalf 
payments. The government-wide financial statements include amounts representing on-behalf 
payments made to the System by the State of Oklahoma.

Note 4 -- Employee Retirement System (continued)  
 
The District’s contributions to TRS (net of retirement credit paid by the State of Oklahoma) for the 
years ended June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $15,873,181, $15,388,645, and $15,047,972, 
respectively, equal to the required contributions for each year. 
 
Pension Reporting – GASB Statement 68, effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2014, 
created new pension reporting standards for plans administered through trusts that have certain 
characteristics.  In the District’s opinion, statutory language and case law place the pension obligation 
for TRS on the State of Oklahoma. Under GASB 68, in financial statements prepared using the 
economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting, a cost-sharing employer that 
does not have a special funding situation is required to recognize a liability for its proportionate share 
of the net pension liability.  Since the District does not present financial statements using the using the 
economic resources measurement focus and accrual basis of accounting, the deferred outflows and  
inflows of resources and pension liability are not included in the district’s financial statements. In the 
District’s opinion, there is no legal or factual way in Oklahoma for a school district to pay for any 
portion of the ultimate pension. According to TRS calculations, the amount of allocated pension 
liability attributable to the District for the year ended June 30, 2017 (the measurement date, which is 
the most current information available) was $153,263,173. 
 
Note 5 – Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)  
 
In addition to the retirement plan described in Note 4, the District participates in the state-administered  
Supplemental Health Insurance Program (OPEB Plan) within Teachers’ Retirement System of 
Oklahoma (the OPEB System), which is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plan 
administered by the Teacher Retirement System (TRS). 

 
Plan Description – The OPEB System pays a monthly health insurance premium supplement for each 
retired member who is enrolled in the health insurance plan provided by the State in the Education 
Employees Group Health and Dental Insurance plan or in an insurance program provided by a 
participating education employer who provides health insurance coverage to former employees, 
provided the retired member had at least ten (10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement.  
 
Benefits Provided – All retirees are eligible except for special retirees (as defined) and spouses and 
beneficiaries as long as they have at least 10 years of service.  Retirees who elect such coverage 
receive the smaller of (i) a Medicare supplement benefit, if eligible, or (ii) an amount between $100 
and $105 per month, depending on service and final average compensation. Payments are made on the 
retirees’ behalf to the Employees Group Insurance Division of the Office of Management and 
Enterprise Services, if the member continues health coverage under that Plan, or (iii) to the member’s 
former employer, if the member retains health coverage under a plan maintained by the former 
employer. 
 
Contributions – Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan provisions 
contained in State Statute Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do not specify or identify any

particular contribution source to pay the health insurance subsidy. The cost of the subsidy averages 
0.15% of normal cost, as determined by an actuarial valuation. 
 
Since the District prepares the financials under a cash receipts and disbursements modified as required 
by the regulations of the Oklahoma Department of Education, the net OPEB liability (asset) is 
disclosure only. At June 30, 2018, the District has an asset of $1,030,027 for its proportionate share of 
the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total OPEB asset 
used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date. The 
District’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share 
of the contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating school 
districts, actuarially determined.  
 
At June 30, 2017, the District’s proportion was 2.30977735%, as compared to  its proportion share of 
2.21776255% measured as of June 30, 2016. 
 
Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset to changes in the discount rate – 
The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset calculated using the 
discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset would 
be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-
point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

Note 6 -- 403(b) Retirement Savings Plan 
 
The District sponsors a 403(b) retirement savings plan in which all employees of the District are 
eligible to participate.  Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b) annuity contracts are a “private” 
retirement vehicle available to public school district employees.  The annuity contracts supplement 
and are separate from the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System.  Annuity contracts and 403(b) 
contributions are tax deferred and are funded through elective pre-income tax deductions up to limits 
set by federal law.  The District does not make contributions into the plan.  Participants may choose 
their investment provider from a list of approved investment providers under the plan.  The plan 
provides for withdrawals only upon attainment of age 59½, severance from employment, total and 
permanent disability, death, a “qualified reservist” distribution, or financial hardship as defined by the 
plan.  The District has contracted a third party administrator to provide administrative services.  The 
agreement provides for a charge of $12 per year for each participant, to be paid by the participants.

Note 7 -- Risk Management 
 
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions and natural disasters. For occurrences prior to April 9, 2014 the District 
was covered under commercial insurance policies. Effective April 9, 2014, the District joined a joint 
self-insurance trust whose members consist of school districts in the state of Oklahoma for the purpose 
of insuring against property, general liability and automobile/fleet losses. Cash from member 
contributions and investment earnings is used to pay claims. The trust purchases reinsurance through a 
commercial insurer to limit its maximum loss and minimize exposure on larger risks. There have been 
no significant reductions in coverage from the prior year and insurance settlements have not exceeded 
coverage since joining the self-insurance trust. 
 
Note 8 -- Contingencies 
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor 
agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a liability of the 
applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot 
be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 
The District is defendant in various lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse 
effect on the financial condition of the District.  Should a judgment be awarded against the District, it 
would be levied through the District’s sinking fund over a three-year period pursuant to state law. 
 
The District has the following outstanding construction commitments as of June 30, 2018:

Note 11 – Tax Abatement  
 
The State of Oklahoma has authorized by Oklahoma State Statutes Title 31 to offer Homestead and 
Veterans exemptions to Ad Valorem property taxes. These exemptions reduce the ad valorem taxes 
remitted to the District.   For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District had the $2,444,188 in abated ad 
valorem tax revenues.   
 
Note 12 – New GASB Standards  
 
GASB Statement No.75, Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions establishes standards for 
recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows and inflows of resources and 
expenses/expenditures. Furthermore, this statement details the recognition and disclosure requirements 
for employers with payables to defined benefit OPEB plans that are administered by trusts that meet 
the specified criteria and for employers whose employees are provided with defined contribution 
OPEB. Since the District’s financial statements are reported using the cash receipts and disbursements 
modified basis as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma Department of Education, the net OPEB 
liability (asset) is not required to be presented in these financial statements, but the District’s portion of 
net OPEB liability (asset) is disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements.

Note 13 – Subsequent Events 
 
Subsequent to the fiscal year end, the District issued the fourth and final installment of bonds from the 
February 14, 2017 bond election. Voters in the District approved the issuance of bonds totaling 
$111,000,000, to be issued in four series over a two-year period.  The bond issues provide for additions 
which will double as storm shelters to include classrooms at Frontier, Heritage, Northern Hills, and 
Chisholm elementary schools and Memorial and North high schools, gymnasiums at Charles Haskell 
Elementary and Sequoyah and Central Middle schools, a media center at Cimarron Middle School, and 
a band room at Santa Fe High School.  Upgrades at Angie Debo, Cross Timbers, and Will Rogers 
elementary schools and Summit Middle School will provide shelter space at those locations.  With the 
completion of these projects, all of the schools in the District will have adequate shelter space for 
students and staff in the event of a tornado.   
 
Bond proceeds also provide for stadium upgrades at Memorial and North high schools, tennis facilities, 
science classroom and other improvements to existing facilities as well as transportation and 
equipment purchases.  The first installment in the amount of $37,580,000 was issued in March 2017, 
and the second installment of $20,000,000 was issued in August 2017. The third installment of 
$30,900,000 was in March 2018, and the final installment of $22,520,000 was issued August 2018.   
 
Construction commitments subsequent to year end totaled $22,473,000 from bond funds.  These 
commitments include a construction contract in the amount of $16,005,000 for an indoor/outdoor 
tennis center to be built in conjunction with the City of Edmond.  The City will provide the land valued 
at $2,500,000 under a 30-year lease agreement for $1 per year, and also contribute cash which 
combined will equal half of the project costs.  The District will pay its half of the project costs from 
bond funds.  Design and construction will be bid and coordinated by the District, with the City 
providing its share of the cash resources directly to the District.  The constructed assets will belong to 
the District.  The facility will be operated by the City subject to an operating agreement with the 
District which stipulates operating guidelines and cost sharing responsibilities.  Construction will begin 
in 2019. 
 
A plaintiff group won a lawsuit against the Oklahoma Tax Commission over the allocation method 
used for motor vehicle taxes when guaranteed prior year collections for the month could not be paid.  
The original lawsuit did not seek to recoup past amounts, and the state law changed for 2018 making 
the new allocation method permanent.  In November 2018, the same plaintiff group filed another 
lawsuit asking for redistribution of amounts from the 13 months affected before the law change.  The 
plaintiffs prevailed in that suit.  The resulting redistribution would reduce the District’s future 
collections by $2.4 million over thirteen months.  Possible challenges could delay or stay 
implementation of the reallocation.  It should be noted, however, that because motor vehicle 
collections are equalized through the state aid formula, the effect on District revenue will be a timing 
difference.  Reduced motor vehicle collections in the current year will produce an equal increase in 
state aid collections in the following year by function of the state aid formula.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT 
AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
To the Board of Education 
Edmond Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma 
Edmond, Oklahoma 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in  Government Auditing Standards  
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental 
activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Edmond Independent 
School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Edmond Independent 
School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s basic financial statements and have issued our 
report thereon dated January 16, 2018. Our report included an adverse opinion on U.S. generally 
accepted accounting principles because the District prepares its financial statements on a prescribed 
regulatory basis of accounting.  
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit, we considered Edmond Independent School District No.12, 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine 
the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our 
opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of Edmond Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s internal 
control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Edmond Independent 
School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s internal control. 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a 
timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance. 
Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in 
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control 



Government Auditing Standards.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE  
FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL  

CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Edmond Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma 
Edmond, Oklahoma 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Edmond Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement 
that could have a direct and material effect on each of Edmond Independent School District No.12, 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Edmond 
Independent School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs are 
identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and 
questioned costs. 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grants applicable to its federal programs. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Edmond Independent School 
District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to 
financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the 
United States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). 
Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred 
to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit 
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Edmond Independent School District No.12, 
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Edmond Independent 
School District No.12, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma’s compliance.
