INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 
 

To the Board of Education 
Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma 
Ardmore, Oklahoma 
Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activities, each major 
fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, 
Oklahoma, as of and for June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which 
collectively comprise the District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting practices prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education 
described in Note I; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
As described in Note I, the financial statements are prepared by Ardmore School District No. I-19, 
Carter County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of Oklahoma State 
Department of Education. The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the 
regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I and accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion 
on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles” paragraph, the financial statements referred to in 
the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America, the financial position of Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter 
County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial position for the year then ended. 
Unmodified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material 
respects, the respective financial position on a regulatory basis of governmental activities, each major 
fund and the aggregate remaining fund information on a regulatory basis of Ardmore School District 
No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial 
position on a regulatory basis for the year then ended, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions 
of Oklahoma State Department of Education as described in Note I. 
Other Matters 
Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that 
collectively comprise the Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s financial 
statements as a whole. The management discussion and analysis, budgetary comparison schedules, 
combining nonmajor fund financial statements, statement of changes in activity fund subaccounts and 
other information as listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and 
are not a required part of the financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of 
federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is 
presented for purposes of additional analysis and is also not a required part of the financial statements.  
The combining nonmajor fund financial statements, statement of changes in activity fund subaccounts 
and the schedule expenditures of federal awards  is the responsibility of management and was derived 
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the 
audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare 
the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, 
the information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.  
The Oklahoma Department of Education requires management discussion and analysis, budgetary 
information, statement of statutory fidelity and honesty bonds and schedule of accountant’s

As management of the Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma (the “District”), 
we offer readers of the District’s financial statements this narrative overview and analysis of the 
financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.  We encourage readers to 
consider the information presented here.  The basic financial statements include government-wide 
financial statements and fund financial statements.  For a further understanding of the difference 
between these financial statements, a detailed discussion is provided on page 19.  
 
Financial Highlights 
 
With respect to the government-wide financial statements: 
 
  The assets of the District exceeded its liabilities at the close of the most recent fiscal year by 

$32,307,271 (net position), which is an increase of $723,825 from the prior year.  Of the 
amount at June 30, 2018, $2,107,090 (unrestricted net position) may be used to meet the 
entity’s ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.   

 
With respect to the fund financial statements: 
 
  As of the close of the current fiscal year, the District’s governmental funds reported combined 

ending fund balances of $9,671,387, a decrease of $135,285 from the prior year.  
 
  At the end of the current fiscal year, unassigned fund balance for the general fund was 

$1,642,637. 
 
Other highlights: 
 
The voters approved $2,500,000 Transportation Series Bonds in November 2017.  In February 2018, 
the Board of Education approved the sale of $3,075,000 General Obligation Combined Purpose Bonds; 
the proceeds were received by the District on March 22, 2018.  The purpose of these bonds were to 
provide $1,000,000 proceeds for the Transportation series bonds and $2,075,000 proceeds for the 
CCPFA lease payment as explained in the following paragraph.  Ten buses were purchased and 
received by June 30, 2018. 
 
On September 1, 2013, the Board of Education entered into ground lease and sublease agreements with 
the Carter County Public Facilities Authority (CCPFA), a public trust, for the purpose of facilitating 
the issuance of the bonds, to provide security for payment of the bonds, and to enable the District to 
utilize the bond proceeds for the construction and placement of improvements on real property.  The 
lease agreements will remain in effect to June 30, 2027.  In conjunction with these lease agreements, 
the District will issue general obligation bonds to repay the lease.  The District received $2,075,000 
proceeds from the $3,075,000 General Obligation Combined Purpose Bonds on March 22, 2018.

In June 2018, a local charitable foundation granted the District $4,000,000 to help construct the 
Performing Arts Center.  The grant will be distributed in annual payments of $500,000 from 2018 
through 2025.  The first payment of $500,000 was received on June 7, 2018. 
 
Overview of the Financial Statements 
 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the entity’s basic financial 
statements.  The District’s basic financial statements comprise three components: 1) government-wide 
financial statements, 2) fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements.  This report 
also contains other supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves. 
 
Government-wide financial statements.  The government-wide financial statements include the 
statement of net position – regulatory basis and the statement of activities – regulatory basis and are 
designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the District’s finances, in a manner similar to a 
private-sector business. 
 
The statement of net position – regulatory basis presents information on all of the District’s assets and 
liabilities, with the difference between the two reported as net position.  Over time, increases or 
decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of the 
District is improving or deteriorating. 
 
The statement of activities – regulatory basis presents information showing how the government’s net 
position changed during the most recent fiscal year.  All changes in net position are reported using the 
regulatory basis of accounting whereby revenues represent cash receipts collected by June 30th and 
expenditures represent cash disbursements modified by encumbrances, investments, inventories, 
capital assets, depreciation, and long-term debt.  
 
The governmental activities of the District include instruction, supporting services, non-instruction 
services, capital outlay, and other outlays.  These functions are principally supported by State of 
Oklahoma appropriations, grants and fees. 
 
The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 14-15 of this report. 
 
Fund financial statements.  A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control 
over resources that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives.  The District uses fund 
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements.  The 
District only has governmental funds. 
 
Governmental funds.  Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions 
reported as governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the 
government-wide financial statements, governmental fund financial statements focus on cash 
collections and encumbrances, as well as balances of spendable resources available at the end of the 
fiscal year.  Such information may be useful in evaluating a government’s near-term financing 
requirements.

Overview of the Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial 
statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar 
information presented for governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements.  By 
doing so, readers may better understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing 
decisions.  Both the governmental fund balance sheet – regulatory basis and the governmental fund 
statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances – regulatory basis provide a 
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
The District maintains fourteen individual governmental funds.  Information is presented separately in 
the governmental fund balance sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, 
expenditures, and changes in fund balances for the General Fund, Building Fund, Sinking Fund, Sales 
Tax Fund and Bond Fund 37 which are considered to be major funds.  Data from the other nine 
governmental funds are combined into an aggregated presentation.  Individual fund data for each of 
these nonmajor governmental funds is provided in the form of combining statements elsewhere in this 
report. 
 
The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its general fund, building fund, child nutrition 
fund, coop fund, and sinking fund.  A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the 
general fund and all major funds to demonstrate compliance with this budget. 
 
The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 16-17 of this report. 

 
Notes to the financial statements.  The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full 
understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements.  The notes 
to the financial statements can be found on pages 19-37 of this report. 
 
Other information.  In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report 
also presents certain other information concerning the District’s budget to actual schedules on major 
governmental funds, combining and individual fund statements and schedules.  Other information can 
be found on pages 39-41 and pages 42-43 of this report. 
 
Government-wide Financial Analysis 
 
As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a government’s financial 
position.  In the case of the District, assets exceeded liabilities by $32,307,271 at the close of the most 
recent fiscal year, as shown on the following page.

Government-wide Financial Analysis (Continued) 
 
The District’s Operating Grants and Contributions had a net increase of $719,430 during the year 
ended June 30, 2018, due to several large one-time donations, grant for the Performing Arts Center, 
and the timing of federal claim reimbursements.  
 
Capital Grants and Contributions decreased $802,468 primarily due to the donation of football field 
artificial turf during the year ended June 30, 2017. 

 
Property taxes levied for general purposes and building purposes increased $68,024 and $9,721, 
respectively, during the year ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to slight increase in property 
valuations.  

 
Property taxes levied for sinking fund purposes decreased $127,353 during the year ended June 30, 
2018, due to reduction of outstanding bond debt.  

 
General taxes increased $114,252 primarily due to $155,937 increase in Gross Production Taxes net of 
$46,672 reduction in Motor Vehicle Taxes.  
 
Investment earnings decreased $76,200 due to $104,354 net decreased rental income primarily from a 
building no longer being leased at full capacity, offset by $25,789 increase in interest income. 

 
State Aid – Noncategorical revenues increased $431,370 primarily due to the effects of the following 
categories in the state aid formula:  increase in state aid factors ($131,926), decrease in weighted ADM 
($385,896), increase in ad valorem chargeable ($65,045), the reduction of other chargeables 
($592,878), and a reduction of returned FY17 state aid ($88,066).  In addition to the increase in the 
state aid formula, there was an increase in flexible benefit allowance of $245,573. 
 
The $5,927 Loss on Disposal of Assets for the year ended June 30, 2018, is primarily attributable to 
the obsolescence of technology-related equipment, software, and security systems.  

 
Instruction expenses increased $226,796 primarily due to increase in teaching positions, new band 
instruments, and outside instructional services.  These increases were offset by a decrease in 
technology purchases. 
 
Support Services increased $471,820 primarily due to the addition of instructional coaching positions, 
a psychometrist, a few support employees, and depreciation expense.  These increases were offset by a 
decrease in technology purchases, legal fees, and staff training. 
 
Facilities Acquisition and Construction Services increased $25,245 primarily due to architectural 
services provided to assist with the drawings and costs for proposed bond projects.

Financial Analysis of the Government’s Funds 
 
As noted earlier, the District uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-
related legal requirements. 
 
Governmental funds.  The focus of the District’s governmental funds is to provide information on cash 
collections and encumbrances, as well as balances of spendable resources available at the end of the 
fiscal year.  Such information is useful in assessing the District’s financing requirements.  In particular, 
unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for 
spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, the District’s governmental funds reported combined ending 
fund balances of $9,671,387, a decrease of $135,285 in comparison with the prior year.  This amount 
includes $1,642,637, unassigned fund balance, which is available for spending at the District’s 
discretion.  
 
The general fund is the chief operating fund of the District.  At the end of the current fiscal year, total 
fund balance of the general fund was $2,107,090,` of which $464,453 was restricted by state statute, 
donors and external grantors. 
 
General Fund Budgetary Comparisons 
 
The District budgets conservatively.  Revenues are budgeted based upon statutorily-limited amounts 
equaling 90% of the prior year’s collections; approved millage rates for ad valorem taxes; and 
approved allocation amounts from federal, state, and local grantors.  Expenditures and carryover are 
budgeted based upon the legal appropriations approved by the county excise board.   
 
During fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, General Fund property tax revenue was $1,234,539 less than 
the budgeted amount, reflecting an 18% decrease in revenues. This decrease is primarily due to a 
property valuation adjustment for 2014 that was made after the 2017 budget was presented and 
approved by the County Excise Board. 
 
State revenues increased $345,739 primarily due to an increase of $185,787 in State Foundation and 
Salary Incentive Aid, a $245,573 increase Flexible Benefit Allowance offset by a $46,672 decrease in 
Motor Vehicle taxes and a $17,074 decrease in School Land Earnings.  
 
Federal revenues increased $57,333 primarily due to the timing of federal claim reimbursements. 
 
Other revenues increased $413,474 primarily due to collection of a large, one-time local grant and 
advanced funding of a grant for school nurses. 
 
General fund actual instruction expenditures were $2,441,695 less than budgeted instruction 
expenditures due to the District’s conservative approach to carryover fund balance to the next fiscal 
year.

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of net assets are different because:
Capital assets used in governmental activities are not financial resources and,

therefore, are not reported in the fund. The costs of assets is $85,659,050
and the accumulated depreciation is $39,848,166. 45,810,884        

Long-term capital lease and bond payable obligations are not due and payable in the current period and accordingly 
are not reported as fund liabilities. Long-term liablities at year-end consist of: 

Bond Payable: 7,755,000                    
Capital Lease Payable: 15,420,000

For the Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 

See Notes to Financial Statements

Amounts reported for governmental activities
 in the statement of activities are different because:

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds (135,285)$        

Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However, in the
statement of activities the costs of those assets are allocated over their estimated
useful lives and reported as depreciation expense.  This is the amount by which Capital Outlay 1,871,275$        
depreciation expense exceeded capital outlays in the current period. Depreciation Expense (1,980,825)         (109,550)          

The net effect of various miscellaneous transactions involving
capital assets (I.e., sales, trade-ins, disposals and donations) is to (6,340)              
decrease net position.

Bond proceeds are reported as financing sources in governmental funds and thus contribute
to the change in fund balance.  In the statement of net position however issuing debt increases 
long term liabilities and does not affect the statement of activities. Similarly, repayment of principal
is an expenditure in the governmental funds but reduces the liability in the statement of net position. 
Debt repayments this year exceeds debt issued: Debt Issued (3,075,000)         

Debt Repayments 2,590,000          (485,000)          

The repayment of the principal on capital leases consumes current financial resources
of government funds. However this transaction does not have an effect on 
net position. 1,460,000        

Change in net position of governmental activities 723,825$

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 

 
The Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma (the “District”) is a corporate 
body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a 
separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The District is part of the public 
school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of 
Education and is financially dependent on the state of Oklahoma for support.  The general 
operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in 
Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The Reporting Entity 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members.  
The superintendent is the executive officer of the Board of Education and the administrative 
head of the District. 

 
Financial Statement Presentation  
 The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is, in substance, the 
format established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 
34, Basic Financial Statement-Management’s Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local 
Governments. 
 GASB Statement No. 34 established a financial reporting model for state and local 
governments that included the addition of management’s discussion and analysis, government-
wide financial statements, required supplementary information and the elimination of the 
effects of internal service activities and the use of account groups to the already required fund 
financial statements and notes. 
 
Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements 
 
The District’s basic financial statements include both government-wide (reporting the District 
as a whole) and fund financial statements (reporting the District’s major funds). Both 
government-wide and fund financial statements categorize primary activities as either 
governmental or business type. Governmental activities include programs primarily supported 
by taxes, State aid, grants and other intergovernmental revenue. The District does not have any 
activities classified as business-type. The government-wide focus is more on the sustainability 
of the District as an entity and the change in the District’s net position resulting from current 
year’s activities.  
 
Government-Wide Financial Statements: In the government-wide Statement of Net Position- 
regulatory basis, the District’s governmental activities are reported on cash receipts and 
disbursement basis modified as required by regulations of the Oklahoma Department of 
Education to include fixed assets, long-term debt and obligations. The District’s net position is 
reported in three parts: net investment in capital assets, restricted net position and unrestricted 
net position.

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 

 
The government-wide Statement of Activities – regulatory basis reports both the gross and net 
cost of each of the District’s programs and functions. The functions are also supported by 
general government revenues. The Statement of Activities – regulatory basis reduces gross 
expenses (including depreciation) by related program revenues, operating and capital grants. 
Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific function.  Program 
revenues include 1) charges to students, faculty, individuals, or other school districts that 
purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given 
function and 2) grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital 
requirements of a particular function.  Taxes, interest, transfers and other items not properly 
included among program revenues are reported instead as general revenues. 

 
 All interfund transactions are eliminated in the government-wide statements. 

 
Fund Financial Statements: Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the 
cash receipts and disbursements basis of accounting modified as required by the Oklahoma 
Department of Education to include investments and inventories on hand, encumbrances issued 
and warrants outstanding. The fund financial statements provide reports on the financial 
condition and results of operations of governmental fund categories. 
 
The District reports the following major governmental funds: 
 

General Fund is the primary operating fund of the District. It is used to account for all 
financial resources except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
 
Building Fund is used to account for resources restricted by statutes for ad valorem 
taxes designated for repair, maintenance, acquisition and construction of buildings. 
 
Debt Service Fund – The District accounts for the accumulation of funds for the 
periodic payment of general long-term debt in this fund. 
 
Sales Tax Fund – is used to account for proceeds of sales taxes used for instructional 
materials, technology, building furniture, equipment and construction.  
 
Bond Fund 37 – is used to account for proceeds from long-term financing and 
revenues and expenditures related to authorized construction and other capital asset 
acquisitions.

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 
Additionally, the District reports the following fund types included in the Other Governmental 
Funds column: 
 

Special Revenue Funds – The District accounts for resources restricted or committed 
to specific purposes other than debt service or capital projects where the foundation for 
the fund is those resources or if the fund is legally mandated in special revenue funds. 
 
Capital Project Funds -- The proceeds from long-term financing and revenues and 
expenditures related to authorized construction and other capital asset acquisitions are 
accounted for in a capital projects fund.   
 
Permanent Fund – The District reports resources that are restricted to the extent that 
only earnings, and not principal, may be used to support the District’s programs in this 
fund. 

 
Basis of Accounting 
 
Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounts 
and reported in the financial statements. It relates to the timing of the measurements made 
regardless of the measurement focus applied. 

 
As to the basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis 
of cash receipts and disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma 
Department of Education as follows: 
 Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for 

the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 
 Vendor obligations due and payable for goods and services received are recorded as a 

payable until paid. 
 Warrants/Checks payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
 Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased and reduced when 

used. 
  Capital assets in the government-wide statements are recorded when acquired and 

depreciated over their useful lives. 
 Long-term debt reported in the government-wide statements is recorded when incurred. 
 Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the 

obligation is incurred.

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, which would have required the government-wide financial 
statements as well as the fiduciary fund financial statements to be presented on the accrual 
basis of accounting. The fund financial statements under accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America would have been presented on the modified accrual 
basis of accounting. These financial statements are presented on the basis of accounting 
described above. 
 

 
Deposits and Investments 

 
The District’s cash and cash equivalents are considered to be cash on hand, demand deposits, 
and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of 
acquisition. Collateral in the form of obligations of the U.S. government or its agencies, 
municipalities or the State of Oklahoma is required for demand deposits and certificates of 
deposit for all amounts not covered by federal depository insurance. 

 
Permissible investments include direct obligations of the United States government and 
agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank and trust companies; 
and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, banks and trust 
companies.   
 
Investments for the District are reported at historical value. The investments held by the 
District as equity securities were donated. 

 
Inventories  

 
The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the financial 
statements. On the government-wide financial statements, United States Department of 
Agriculture (USDA) food commodities are recorded as revenue at fair value as of the date of 
receipt and as an expense when used. USDA food commodities are not reported in the 
governmental funds. 

 
Capital Assets 

 
Capital assets, which include land, land improvements, buildings, buses and vehicles, 
machinery and equipment, and construction in progress, are reported in the applicable 
governmental activities columns in the government-wide financial statements.  Capital assets

are defined by the government as assets with an initial individual cost of more than $5,000 and 
an estimated useful life in excess of one year.  Such assets are recorded at historical cost or  
estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at 
estimated fair market value at the date of donation.  

 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or 
materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. Major outlays for capital assets and 
improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. 

 
Property, plant, and equipment of the District, is depreciated using the straight-line method 
over the following estimated useful lives. 

 
               Assets    Years 
   Land Improvements       15 
   Buildings    20 – 40 
   Buses & Vehicles   5 – 10 
   Machinery and Equipment  3 – 10  
 

Net Position 
When the District incurs an expense for which it may either use restricted or unrestricted net 
position, it uses restricted net position first unless unrestricted net position will have to be 
returned because they are not used. 
 
Net assets on the Statement of Net Position – Regulatory Basis include the following: 
 

Net Investment in Capital Assets, – The component of net position that reports the 
difference between capital assets less both accumulated depreciation and the 
outstanding balance of debt  that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction 
and improvement of these capital assets. 
 
Restricted for Building Services – The component of net position that reports the excess 
of property taxes and other revenues collected in excess of expenses for operation of the 
District’s buildings. This amount is restricted by Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
Restricted for Child Nutrition – The component of net position that report the assets 
restricted for use by the Child Nutrition program. 
 
Restricted for Debt Service – The component of net position that report the assets 
restricted for payment of principal and interest on general long-term debt.

by voters. 

 
Restricted for Alternative Education – The component of net position that report the

Restricted for Scholarships – The component of net position that report the assets 
restricted for scholarships. 
 
Unrestricted – The difference between assets and liabilities that is not reported as 
restricted for any other purposes. 

 
Fund Equity 

 
The governmental fund financial statements present fund balances based on classifications that 
comprise a hierarchy that is based primarily on the extent to which the District is bound to 
honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in the respective governmental 
funds can be spent. The classifications used in the governmental fund financial statements are 
as follows: 

 
 Nonspendable: This classification includes amounts that cannot be spent because they 

are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) are legally or contractually required to be 
maintained intact. The District has classified the original funds donated in the 
Endowment Fund as being nonspendable as these amounts are legally required to be 
maintained intact. 

 Restricted: This classification includes amounts for which constraints have been placed 
on the use of the resources either (a) externally imposed by creditors (such as through a 
debt covenant), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or 
(b) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. The 
District has classified amounts restricted by state statute, donors and external grantors in 
this classification. 

 Committed: This classification includes amounts that can be used only for specific 
purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. 
These amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless the Board of Education 
removes or changes the specified use by taking the same type of action (resolution) that 
was employed when the funds were initially committed. This classification also includes 
contractual obligations to the extent that existing resources have been specifically 
committed for use in satisfying those contractual requirements. The District has 
classified school organization activities as being committed because their use is 
governed by Board of Education action.

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 

 Assigned: This classification includes amounts that are constrained by the District’s 
intent to be used for a specific purpose but are neither restricted nor committed. This 
intent can be expressed by the Board of Education or through the Board of Education 
delegating this responsibility to the superintendent through the budgetary process. This 
classification also includes the remaining positive fund balance for all governmental 
funds except for the General Fund. The District has assigned funds for interest earnings 
to the special revenue funds and capital project funds where earned by the budgetary 
process. 

 Unassigned: This classification includes the residual fund balance for the General Fund. 
The Unassigned classification also includes negative residual fund balance of any other 
governmental fund that cannot be eliminated by offsetting of Assigned fund balance 
amounts.

The District would typically use restricted fund balances first, followed by committed 
resources, and then assigned resources as appropriate opportunities arise, but reserves the right 
to selectively spend unassigned resources first to defer the use of these other classified funds. 
 
Property Tax Revenues 

 
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which consist of ad valorem taxes 
on real and personal property within the District.  The County Assessor, upon receipt of the 
certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for 
submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1.  The county treasurer must commence 
tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls.  The taxes are due one-half prior to 
January 1 and the balance prior to April 1. If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax 
becomes due and payable on January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the 
year following the year of assessment.

I. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) 
 
Property Tax Revenues (Continued) 
 
If not paid for a period of three years or more as of the date of such taxes first become due, the 
property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. 
 
State Revenues 

 
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid 
formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board 
of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on 
information accumulated from the districts. Approximately 39% of the District’s revenue 
comes from state sources. 
 
 After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department 
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors 
disclosed by review.  Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of 
revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 

 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs.  State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs 
be expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require that the money 
not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be 
expended for the same categorical programs.   
 

II. BUDGETARY INFORMATION  
 

The District is required by law to prepare an annual budget. No later than October 1, each 
Board of Education shall prepare a financial statement and estimate of needs to be filed with 
the applicable county clerk and the State Department of Education. Once the county excise 
board has approved the estimate of needs, the Board shall adopt a final budget within 45 days 
or the second regularly scheduled board meeting. No later than 15 days prior to adoption of a 
final budget, the Board must conduct a public hearing for purposes of taking public comments.  
 
A final budget may be revised upon approval of the Board of Education in open meeting. 
 
A budget is legally adopted for the General Fund, Building Fund, Child Nutrition Fund, Coop 
Fund and Sinking Fund that includes revenue and expenditures. Budgets generally assume the 
expenditure of all available resources. Therefore, when the legal budget is prepared, it is 
assumed these funds will not have a carryover balance to a subsequent year. Program revenue 
received but not spent is restricted and deferred to a subsequent fiscal year.

III. DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS 
 

Custodial Credit Risk - Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that in the event of a bank 
failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned or the District will not be able to recover 
collateral securities in the possession of an outside party.  The District’s policy requires 
collateral for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal 
deposit insurance.  As of June 30, 2018, cash deposits and investments were fully insured or 
collateralized by a pledging bank’s agent in the District’s name. 
 
Investment – The District’s investment of $37,666 at June 30, 2018, represents equity 
securities valued at historical value that were donated to the District. These securities are 
uninsured and exposed to the risk that in the event of the failure of the counterparty, the District 
will not be able to recover the value of the investment.

VI. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM 
 

Teachers’ Retirement System of Oklahoma 
 

Plan Description - The District contributes to the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' 
Retirement System ("TRS"), a cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement 
system.  The System is administered by a board of trustees. TRS provides retirement, disability 
and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Oklahoma State Statute 70-17 assigns 
the authority to establish and amend benefit provisions to the TRS Board of Trustees. The 
System issues a publicly available report that includes financial statements and required 
supplementary information for TRS. That report may be obtained by contacting the Oklahoma 
Teachers’ Retirement System. 

 
Benefits Provided – The System provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ final 
compensation, age, and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for 
benefits upon disability and to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O.S. Sec. 
17-105 defines all retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions 
rests with the State Legislature.

VI. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM (continued)  

 
Funding Policy – Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of 
Oklahoma, and participating employees. Participation is required for all teachers and other 
certified employees and is optional for all other regular employees of public educational 
institutions who work at least 20 hours per week.  
 
Contributions – In accordance with Oklahoma Statutes, System members are required to 
contribute 7.00% of applicable compensation.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, qualifying 
employee contributions were reduced by a retirement credit of $138,787 provided by Enrolled 
House Bill 1873 and paid by the State of Oklahoma as on-behalf payments.  For the year ended 
June 30, 2018, the District had a statutory contribution rate of 9.5% plus 7.80% as a match for 
salaries funded by federal programs.  The contribution requirements of System members and 
the District are established and may be amended by the state legislature.  For the year ended 
June 30, 2018, the District contributions to the System for were $1,579,984. 

 
The State of Oklahoma, a non-employer contributing entity, provides funds through 5% of the 
State’s sales, use, corporate and individual income taxes collected. The System receives 1% of 
the cigarette taxes collected by the State and 5% of net lottery proceeds collected by the State.  
The District’s estimated share of these contributions based on their covered payroll for the 
measurement period was $1,066,558. 

 
Pension Liability and Pension Expense  
At June 30, 2018, the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability was 
$24,413,297. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total pension 
liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as 
of that date. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of 
the District’s long-term share of the contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected 
contributions of all participating school districts, actuarially determined. At June 30, 2017, the 
District’s proportion was 0.36792453% which was a decrease of 0.00490420% of the 
proportion measured as of June 30, 2016.  
 
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a 
building block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return 
(expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each 
major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return 
by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage 
and by adding expecting inflation.

VI. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM (continued)  

 
The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return for each 
major asset class as of June 30, 2017, are summarized in the following table: 

Asset Class Target Allocation

Long-Term 
Expected Real 
Rate of Return

Fixed Income 23.50% 2.50%
Domestic Equity 38.50% 7.50%
International Equity 19.00% 8.50%
Private Equity
Real Estate 9.00% 4.50%
Alternative Assets 10.00% 6.10%

100.00%
 

Discount rate –A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension liability 
as of June 30, 2017.  This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return 
on pension plan investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of 
cash flows, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to 
be available to finance all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. 
Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all 
periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 
 
Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability to changes in the 
discount rate – The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension 
liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s proportionate 
share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-
percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

VII. OTHER POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS (OPEB)  

 
In addition to the retirement plan described in Note VI, the District participates in the state-
administered  Supplemental Health Insurance Program (OPEB Plan) within Teachers’ 
Retirement System of Oklahoma (the OPEB System), which is a cost-sharing multiple-
employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Teacher Retirement System (TRS). 
 
Plan Description – The OPEB System pays a monthly health insurance premium supplement 
for each retired member who is enrolled in the health insurance plan provided by the State and 
Education Employees Group Health and Dental Insurance plan or in an insurance program 
provided by a participating education employer who provides health insurance coverage to 
former employees, provided the retired member had at least ten (10) years of Oklahoma service 
prior to retirement.  
 
Benefits Provided – All retirees are eligible except for special retirees (as defined) and spouses 
and beneficiaries as long as they have at least 10 years of service.  Retirees who elect such 
coverage receive the smaller of (i) a Medicare supplement benefit, if eligible, or (ii) an amount 
between $100 and $105 per month, depending on service and final average compensation. 
Payments made on the retirees’ behalf to the Employees Group Insurance Division of the 
Office of Management and Enterprise Services, if the member continues health coverage under 
that Plan, or (ii) to the member’s former employer, if the member retains health coverage under 
a plan maintained by the former employer. 
 
Contributions – Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS Plan 
provisions contained in State Statute Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do not specify 
or identify any particular contribution source to pay the health insurance subsidy. The cost of 
the subsidy averages 0.15% of normal cost, as determined by an actuarial valuation. 
 
Since the District prepares the financials under regulatory basis as required by the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education, the net OPEB liability (asset) is disclosure only. At June 30, 
2018, the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset of $164,073. The net OPEB 
asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total OPEB asset used to calculate the net 
OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date. The District’s proportion 
of the net OPEB asset was based on a projection of the District’s long-term share of the 
contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating school 
districts, actuarially determined.  
 
At June 30,2017, the District’s proportion was 0.36792453%, as compared to  its proportion 
share of 0.37282873% measured as of June 30, 2016. 
 
See Note VI. Employee pension plans for Actuarial measurement, discount rate, long-term 
expected rate of return and target asset allocation

VIII. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by 
grantor agencies.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute 
a liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be 
disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the District expects such 
amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 

 
The District is a defendant in lawsuits. Although the outcome of these lawsuits is not presently 
determinable, the District believes the resolution of these matters will not have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition of the District. Should a judgment be awarded against 
the District, it would be levied through the District’s sinking fund over a three-year period 
pursuant to state law.  
 
The District entered into several construction-related contracts during the fiscal year, which 
include additions, new construction, and remodeling of school buildings. As of June 30, 2018, 
the District had outstanding construction-related commitments totaling $225,823 that will be 
financed from proceeds from building fund and sales tax fund.

IX. RISK MANAGEMENT  
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft, damage and destruction of 
assets, errors and omission, injuries to employees, life and health of employees, and natural 
disasters for which the District purchases commercial insurance. There have been no 
significant reductions in coverage from prior year and settlements have not exceeded coverage 
in the past three years.  

  
 X. LEASE REVENUE BOND AGREEMENTS 
 
 On September 1, 2013, the Board of Education entered into ground lease and sublease 

agreements with the Carter County Public Facilities Authority (CCPFA), a public trust, for the 
purpose of facilitating the issuance of the bonds, to provide security for payment of the bonds, 
and to enable the District to utilize the bond proceeds for the construction and placement of 
improvements on real property.  The lease agreements will remain in effect to June 30, 2027. 
The Authority advanced $19,700,000 in lease revenue bonds, series 2013, to the District for the 
acquisition and construction of buildings and improvements.  The District will use money 
received from General Obligation Debt to repay the lease. The advanced funds are being held 
in a trust and District remits applications for payments.  The capital assets acquired and 
constructed have been shown as capital assets on the District’s statement of net position. The 
remaining balance of the advanced fund is reported as Restricted Cash in CCPFA Bond Fund 
on Balance Sheet of Governmental Funds and on the Statement of Net Position.   

 
XI. TAX ABATEMENT  
   
 The State of Oklahoma has authorized by the Oklahoma State Statutes Title 31 to offer 

homestead and Veterans exemptions to Ad Valorem property taxes.  These exemptions reduce 
the ad valorem taxes remitted to the District.   

 
The State of Oklahoma has authorized by Oklahoma Statutes 62-850 the creation of tax 
increment financing (TIF) districts. These districts are intended to provide incentives and 
exemptions from taxation within certain areas to encourage investment, development and 
economic growth. The District is subject to tax abatements granted by the City of Ardmore. 
The City of Ardmore created TIF District #2 in May 2003, amended the project plan in August 
2016, and projected the TIF to terminate December 31, 2021. The purpose of TIF District #2 is 
to develop the Ardmore Commons, Ardmore Family Entertainment Center, Market Street 
Shopping Center, and surrounding areas. This TIF district reduces the ad valorem taxes 
remitted to the District over the term of the agreement. 

 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, abated property taxes were $1,374,541.

XII. NEW GASB STANDARDS  
 

GASB Statement No.75, Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions establishes standards 
for recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows and inflows of resources and 
expenses/expenditures. Furthermore, this statement details the recognition and disclosure 
requirements for employers with payables to defined benefit OPEB plans that are administered 
by trusts that meet the specified criteria and for employers whose employees are provided with 
defined contribution OPEB. Since the District’s financial statements are reported using the cash 
receipts and disbursements modified basis as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma 
Department of Education, the net OPEB liability (asset) is not required to be presented in these 
financial statements, but the District’s portion of net OPEB liability (asset) is disclosed in Note 
VII to the financial statements.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Ardmore School 
District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) 
to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of Ardmore School District No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Ardmore School District No. I-19, 
Carter County, Oklahoma’s internal control.   
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a 
timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance.   
Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in 
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR 
 PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE  

REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
To the Board of Education 
Ardmore School District, No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma 
Ardmore, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Ardmore School District, No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a 
direct and material effect on each of Ardmore School District, No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  Ardmore School District, No.  I-19, Carter 
County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section 
of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grants applicable to its federal programs. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Ardmore School District, No.    
I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial 
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, 
Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards 
and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could 
have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on 
a test basis, evidence about Ardmore School District, No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s compliance 
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.  
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Ardmore School 
District, No. I-19, Carter County, Oklahoma’s compliance.
