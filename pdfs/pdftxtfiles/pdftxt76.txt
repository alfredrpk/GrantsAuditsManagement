INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  

The Honorable Board of Education  
Vinita School District No. I-65 
Vinita, Craig County, Oklahoma 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements — regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and 
the aggregate remaining fund information of the aforementioned School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the School District’s basic financial statements as listed 
in the table of contents.  

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet financial reporting requirements of the State of 
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the 
financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the 
financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note I, the financial statements are prepared by the District, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The effects 
on the financial statements of the variances between regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I and accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determined, are presumed to be material. 

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles” paragraph, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the 
governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the District, as of June 30, 2018, the 
changes in its financial position or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended. 

Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In our opinion, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 
financial position – regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund 
information of the District, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position – regulatory basis for the year 
then ended on the regulator basis of accounting described in Note I.

Other Matters 

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s 
basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as 
required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Guidance Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 
Management’s discussion and analysis, budgetary comparison information and notes, and the combining financial statements, 
as listed in the table of contents, are presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education and are also not a required part of the basic financial statements. 

The schedule of expenditures of federal awards and the combining schedules are the responsibility of management and were 
derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. 
Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain 
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards and combining schedules are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the 
basic financial statements as a whole. 

Management’s discussion and analysis and budgetary comparison information and notes, as listed in the table of contents, which 
are the responsibility of management, have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial 
statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards  

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated January 14, 2018, on our consideration 
of the School District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of 
laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion 
on internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance 
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School District’s internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON 
COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 

ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS  

The Honorable Board of Education  
Vinita School District No. I-1 
Vinita, Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States, the financial statements — regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of the aforementioned School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, which collectively comprise the School District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report 
thereon dated January 14, 2018, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because presentation followed the regulatory basis of 
accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board.  

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the School District’s internal control over 
financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose 
of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the School District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District’s 
internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in 
the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A 
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility 
that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely 
basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a 
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not 
designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these 
limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School District’s financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, 
noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, 
providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express 
such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported 
under Government Auditing Standards.

Purpose of this Report  

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of 
that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is 
an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal 
control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM  
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE  

The Honorable Board of Education  
Vinita School District No. I-1 
Vinita, Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program  

We have audited the aforementioned School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the 
OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the School District’s major federal programs 
for the year ended June 30, 2018. The School District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results 
section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards 
applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the School District’s major federal programs based on our 
audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 
U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that 
could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence about the School District’s compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, 
our audit does not provide a legal determination of the School District’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the School District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  

Report on Internal Control over Compliance  

Management of the School District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance 
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered 
the School District’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect 
on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance 
in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal 
control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District’s internal control 
over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal 
control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be 
prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit 
attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section 
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or 
significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material 
weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control 
over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is 
not suitable for any other purpose.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
June 30, 2018 

 
 
As management of the Vinita School District No. I-65 (District), we offer readers of the District’s financial 
statements this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 
30, 2018. The intent of this discussion and analysis is to look at the District’s financial performance as a whole; 
readers should also review the basic financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements to enhance 
their understanding of the District’s financial performance.   
 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 

• The total net position of the District increased by $976,482 or 7.3% over the fiscal year.  
 

• General revenues accounted for $11,001,395 or 88% of total governmental activities revenue. Program 
specific revenues accounted for $1,450,220 or 12% of total governmental activities revenue. 

 
• The District had $11,475,133 in expenses related to governmental activities: $1,450,220 of these expenses 

was offset by program specific charges for services, grants or contributions. The remaining expenses of the 
governmental activities were offset by property tax levies, state and county sources, and other miscellaneous 
sources. 
 

• Governmental activities capital assets decreased by a net of $475,483, primarily due to the purchase of a 
autoclave offset by current year depreciation.  
 

Overview of the Financial Statements 
 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial statements. The 
District’s financial statements are comprised of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) 
fund financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains other supplementary 
information. 
 
Government–wide financial statements - The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide 
readers with a broad overview of the District’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
 
 The Statement of Net Position presents information on all of the District’s assets and liabilities with a difference 
between the two reported as net position. Over time, increase or decreases in net position may serve as a useful 
indicator of whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the District’s net position changed during the most 
recent year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlining event given rise to the change occurs, 
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statements for 
some items that will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods.(e.g., reserves paid in the following year). 
 
The government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes 
and intergovernmental revenues from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their 
costs through user fees and charges. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 19-20 of this 
report

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
June 30, 2018 

 
 
Fund financial statements – A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources 
that have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The District, like other state and local governments, 
uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds 
of the District can be divided into two categories –governmental funds and  
fiduciary funds. 
 
Governmental Funds- Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide 
financial statements, governmental find financial statements focus on current sources and uses of spendable 
resources, as well as on balances on spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information 
may be useful in evaluation a government’s near-term financing requirements. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is 
useful to compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the 
long-term effect of the government’s near-term financing decision. Both the governmental funds balance sheet and 
the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to 
facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
The District maintains five individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately in the Governmental 
Fund Balance Sheet and in the Governmental Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances 
for the General, Debt Service and Capital Project funds, all of which are considered to be major funds.  
 
The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General, Building and Child Nutrition Funds. Budgetary 
comparison schedules have been provided for the major funds to demonstrate compliance with the budget and are 
presented as required supplemental information. 
 
The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 21-24 of this report. 
 
Fiduciary Funds – Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the 
District. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of these 
funds are not available to support the District’s own programs. 

 
 

The District uses an agency fund to account for resources held for student activities and groups. The basic fiduciary 
fund financial statement can be found on pages 25-26 of this report. 

 
 

Notes to the Financial Statements –The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding 
of the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can 
be found on pages 27-44 of this report.

Governmental Activities

 
Most of the District’s net position is invested in capital assets (land, buildings, buses and equipment).  The

amounts set aside by management for specific purposes as planned by the District or required by law. 
 
The net position of the District increased by $976,482 or 7.3%.  This increase is comprised of a decrease 
of $3,328,991 in net investment in capital assets; an increase of $3,780,655 in restricted net position; and 
an increase of $524,818 in unrestricted net position - the part of net assets that can be used to finance day-

Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates 
 
In the 2018-19 Budget, General Fund revenues are budgeted to decrease from the 2017-18 Budget. General property taxes 
as certified assessed valuations have increased over this year. The State sources of revenue make up 68% of General fund 
revenues and have decreased by 1% from the preceding year. This revenue source is the most volatile and subject to decline 
if the State of Oklahoma is unable to supplement its income.  
 
As a result of the potential impact in revenue, the District has made a concerted effort to limit appropriations to only those 
items truly necessary.

  Payments on capitalized lease obligations are included in capital outlay expenditures  
  in the governmental funds.  The principal portion of these payments is reported
  as a reduction of liabilities in the statement of activities, while the interest portion of these
  lease payments is an expenditure.

             Capital Lease Obligation Payments 26,492.34           

  Payments on general obligaion bonds payable  are included in the debt service expenditures
  in the governmental funds.  The principal portion of these payments is reported

Vinita School District No. I-65 
Craig County, Oklahoma 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
 June 30, 2018 

 
I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

The accompanying financial statements of the Vinita School District, No. I-65, Craig County, Oklahoma (the  “District”) 
conform to the regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis of accounting prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 
Oklahoma.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present the financial position and 
results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The 
District’s accounting policies are described in the following notes that are an integral part of the District’s financial 
statements. 

 
A.  Reporting Entity 

 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly 
is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The District is part of the public school system of 
Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on 
state of Oklahoma support.  The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School 
Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education (Board) composed of five elected members.  The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  The Board, constituting an on-going entity, is the 
level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public elementary and 
secondary school education within the jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District.  The Board receives 
funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of these funding 
source entities.  However, the Board is not included in any other governmental “reporting entity” as defined in 
Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since Board members 
are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate management, the responsibility 
to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. 

 
These financial statements present only the activities of the District.  The Vinita Public School Foundation is not 
included in the reporting entity since the District does not appoint any of the board members or exercise oversight 
authority over the Foundation. The Foundation is an independently operated non-profit organization that was 
developed to assist teachers in improving the quality of education and to provide scholarships. The Foundation exists 
outside the operational boundaries of the school system. There are no component units (entities considered to be 
financially accountable to the District). 

 
B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting 

 
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is, in substance, the format established 
by GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis for State and 
Local Governments. 
 
As the basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as 
follows:

I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the expenditure of 
monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

•    Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased. 
•    Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as assets. 
•    Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
•    Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
•    Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the obligation is paid. 
•    Capital assets are recorded when acquired and depreciated over their useful lives. 

 
 

           This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of   
           America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when they  
           are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for   
           governmental fund types; and when revenues are earned and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types  
           and trust funds. 
 

The Fund financial conform to the regulatory (statutory) basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis 
of accounting other than general accepted accounting principles. The accounting policies are prescribed by the 
Oklahoma Department of Education and conform to the system of accounting authorized by the State of Oklahoma.  
 
The District’s basic financial statements include both government-wide (reporting the District as a whole), including 
a statement of net position and a statement of activities, and fund financial statements (reporting the District’s major 
funds), which provide a more detailed level of financial information.  Both the government-wide and fund financial 
statements categorize primary activities as either governmental or business type.  The District does not have any 
activities classified as business-type activities.  

 
Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measurement focus applied.  
Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures or expenses are recognized in the accounts and reported 
in the financial statements. 
 
Government-Wide Financial Statements 
 
The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities display information on all of the nonfiduciary activities 
of the District. 

           
            The Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Position demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of   
            a given function or activities are offset by program revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly  
            identifiable within a specific function or activity.  Program revenues include charges to customers who  
            purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or activity.  
            In addition, program revenues include grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or  
            capital requirements of a particular function or activity.  Taxes and other items not properly included among  
            program revenues are reported instead as general revenues.

I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 
        The Government-Wide Financial Statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.   The  
         Government-Wide focus is more on the sustainability of the District as an entity and the change in the District’s  
         net assets resulting from the current year’s activities. 

 
         Fund Financial Statements 
 
         The Balance Sheet and the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances are also  
         provided for all of the governmental funds of the District.  The District’s major individual governmental  
         funds are reported as separate columns in the fund financial statements.  Nonmajor funds are aggregated 
         and presented in a single column.  Fiduciary funds are reported separately from governmental funds. 
         
         Fund Accounting - The accounts of the District are organized and operated on the basis of funds and account 
         groups.  A fund is an independent fiscal accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  Fund accounting 
         segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance  
         with finance-related legal and contractual provisions.  The minimum number of funds is maintained consistent  
         with legal and managerial requirements. The two categories of funds are governmental and fiduciary. 
 
         Governmental Funds - are used to account for most of the District’s general activities, including the 
         collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of  
         general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 
    Governmental fund types use the Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting, which is primarily cash receipts and  
         disbursements with certain modifications as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of 
         Education. If the District utilized the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the governmental  
         funds would use the modified accrual basis of accounting based on the flow of current financial resources  
         measurement focus recognizing revenues when susceptible to accrual (i.e., when they become measurable and  
         available, normally considered available if collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period). As a  
         result, Ad valorem taxes on real and personal property associated with the current fiscal period and all other  
         revenue items as recorded as revenues when collected rather than when “measurable” and “available”.  
         Entitlements, grants and shared revenues are recorded at the time of receipt. Expenditures are generally  
         recognized when encumbered or reserved rather than at the time the related liability is incurred. Unmatured  
         interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain compensated absences and claims and judgements  
         which are recognized when the obligations are expended to be liquidated with expendable available financial  
         resources. Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. These practices differ from  
         accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
           
        The following are the District’s major governmental funds: 
 

General Fund - is the general operating fund of the District.  It accounts for all financial resources of the District, 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund.  This is a budgeted fund, and any fund balances are 
considered as resources available for use.  Major revenue sources include local property taxes and federal and 
state funding.  Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for 
programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and other 
long-term debt.  The General Fund also accounts for federal and state financed programs where restricted 
monies must be expended for specific programs. Project accounting is employed to maintain integrity for the 
various sources of these funds.

B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 
                 Debt Service Fund - is the District’s Sinking Fund and accounts for the accumulation of financial 
                 resources for servicing of general long-term debt (principal, interest and related costs). This is a budgeted    
                 fund. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied for debt service. 
 
                 Capital Projects Fund – is the District’s Bond Fund and is used to account for the proceeds of bond sales  
                 used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating   
                 existing facilities, acquisition of technical equipment and acquiring transportation equipment. 
 
  The following are the District’s non-major governmental funds: 
 

Special Revenue Funds - account for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific purposes 
(not including expendable trusts or major capital projects).  The special revenue funds are composed of the 
District's Building Fund and Child Nutrition Fund.  These are budgeted funds and any fund balances are 
considered as resources available for use. 

 
                  Building Fund - The Building Fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for   
                    the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing   
                    furniture, equipment and computer software to be used on or for school district property, for paying  
                    energy and utility costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty  
                    insurance premiums for school facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of  
                    security personnel. 
 
                    Child Nutrition Fund - consists of monies derived from federal and state financial assistance and food   
                     sales.  This fund is used to account for the operations of the school cafeteria.     

 
      Fiduciary Funds - are used to account for assets held by the District in a trustee capacity or as an agent on  
         behalf of others. 
 
                Agency Fund - is custodial in nature and does not present results of operations. Agency Funds are  
                accounted for using the cash basis of accounting.  This fund is the School Activities Fund which is  
                used to account for monies collected principally through fund raising efforts of the students and District- 
                sponsored groups.  This is not a budgeted fund.  The administration is responsible, under the authority of   
                the Board, for collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.  These funds have no equity,  
                assets are equal to liabilities, and do not include revenues and expenditures for general operation of the   
                District.

I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

C.  Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures 
 

1.  Deposits and Investments 
 

State statutes govern the District’s investment policy.  Permissible investments include direct obligations of the 
United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank and 
trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations and trust 
companies.  Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by 
federal deposit insurance.  Investments are stated at cost.  The District invests entirely in  certificates of deposit, 
U.S. Treasury Securities, and participates in the Secured Investment Program of Oklahoma State School Boards 
Association, as authorized by Oklahoma Statutes Title 62, Section 348. 

 
 
2.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 
The District’s financial instruments include cash and investments.  The District’s estimate of the fair value of all 
financial instruments does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial instruments 
recorded in the accompanying balance sheet.  The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates 
fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

 
3.  Estimates 

 
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles   

                  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. 
                  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 

4.  Interfund Transactions 
 

Interfund transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute 
reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another 
fund are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed.  Non-recurring or non-routine 
permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. 

 
5.  Inventories 

 
The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018, is not material to the financial statements.  Acquisitions 
are considered expenditures at the time of purchase and are not recorded for financial statement purposes. 

 
6.  Capital Assets 

 
Capital assets, which include property, plant and equipment, are reported in the Government-Wide Financial 
Statements.  Capital assets are defined by the District as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5,000 
and an estimated useful life in excess of one year.  Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated 
historical cost if purchased or constructed.  Donated capital assets are reported at estimated fair market value at 
the date of donation.

C.  Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 
 

6.  Capital Assets (continued)  
 

                The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend asset    
                 lives are not capitalized. 
 
                 Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. 
 
                 All reported capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful         
                 lives: buildings and improvements (15-60 years); transportation equipment (5-15 years); equipment 
                 (5-15 years). 
    
         7.  Compensated Absences 
 
                 The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in accordance with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes,     
                 Article 6-104, which provides for annual sick leave and personal business days. District policy allows   
                 certified  personnel to accumulate such days to a maximum number of days. Professional service awards are  
                 payable upon retirement based on accumulated sick leave in excess of the negotiated number of days.  
                 Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected in the financial statements because such statements 
                 are prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. This practice differs from generally accepted accounting 
                 principles. 
 

8.  Long-Term Obligations 
 

In the Government-Wide Financial Statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as 
liabilities in the applicable Statement of Net Position.   

 
 

9. Net Position/Fund Balances 
 

In the government-wide financial statement, net position represents the difference between assets and liabilities.  
Net investment in capital assets, consists of capital assets, reduced by the outstanding balances of any borrowing 
used for the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.  Net position is reported as restricted when 
limitations on their use change the nature or normal understanding of the availability of the asset.  Such 
constraints are either externally imposed by creditors, contributors, grantors, laws or other governments, or are 
imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

C.  Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 

 
9. Net Position/Fund Balances (continued) 
 

In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances.  The hierarchy is 
based primarily on the degree of spending constraints places on the use of resources for specific purposed versus 
availability of appropriation. An important distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between amounts 
that are considered nonspendable (i.e, fund balance associated with assets that are not in spendable form, such 
as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or items that are legally required 
to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund) and those  

                  that are spendable (such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or receivables). 
 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, assigned or 
unassigned, as appropriate. 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors (such as debt 
covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments; or by law through constitutional 
provision or enabling legislation. 

Committed fund balance represents amounts that are usable only for specific purposes by formal action of the 
government’s highest level of decision making authority. Such amounts are not subject to legal enforceability 
(like restricted amounts), but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government removes or changes 
by taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment. The District’s Board of Education is the highest 
level of decision making authority of the District. 

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes but are neither 
restricted nor committed.  Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-level body or 
official who the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes.  
Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable amounts (except negative balances) that are reported 
in governmental funds other than the general fund, that are neither restricted nor committed, and amounts in the 
general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance with the provisions of the standard. 

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund.  It represents the amounts that have 
not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes 
within the general fund.

C.  Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 

 
10.  Property Taxes and Other Local Revenues 

 
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 
personal property within the District.  The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from 
the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer.  Property 
taxes are levied on November 1 and are due on receipt of the tax bill.  The first half of taxes is due prior to 
January 1.  The second half is due prior to April 1.  If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes 
due and payable on January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the 
assessment.  If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of the taxes 
due.  The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  If at the end of 
two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.  No provision has been made 
for uncollected taxes, as all taxes are deemed collectible.  Other local sources of revenues include tuition, fees, 
rentals, disposals, commissions and reimbursements. 

 
11.  Intermediate Revenues 

 
Revenue from intermediate sources is the amount of money from funds collected by an intermediate 
administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the district and the state, and distributed to districts in 
amounts that differ in proportion to those which were collected within such systems. 

 
12. State Revenues 

 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs.  State Board 
of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the program for 
which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried 
forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  The State Department of 
Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the general fund.  
 
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by state aid formula under the 
provisions of Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid 
funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts. After review and verification of 
reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period 
allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review.  Normally such adjustments are treated as 
reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

13. Federal Revenues 

 
Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form of operating grants or entitlements.  
An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific purpose, activity or facility.  A grant may be received 
either directly from the federal government or indirectly as a pass through from another government, such as the 
state.  Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant to an allocation formula 
contained in applicable statutes.  The majority of federal revenues received by the District are apportioned to the 
general fund.  The district maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the federal revenues received for the 
child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

 
 

    14. Non-Monetary Resources 
 
          The District receives commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The value of these  
          commodities have been included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. 

 
15. Resource Use Policy 

 
It is in the District’s policy for all funds that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which 
both restricted and unrestricted resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers the 
restricted amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used.  Furthermore, it is the District’s 
policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which committed, assigned or unassigned 
resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers committed, amounts to be spent first, 
followed by assigned amounts, and lastly, unassigned amounts. 
 

 
    16. Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

 
    Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018: 
 

                 GASB Statement No 76, The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles for State and Local 
                 Governments. The objective of GASB 76 is to identify, in the context of the current governmental   
                 financial reporting environment, the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles. The  
                 District has not yet determined the potential impact, if any, this statement could have on its financial  
                 statements.

III.  Other Information 
 

A.  Risk Management 
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; errors 
and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God.  The District purchases commercial insurance to cover these 
risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials liability.  The District had the 
following insurance coverage during the year: commercial property-$44,015,892; general liability -$2,000,000; 
and educators liability- $1,000,000. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial 
insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

 
The District also participates in a risk pool for Workers’ Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or 
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool.  In accordance with GASB No. 10, the District reports the 
required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense.  The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 
Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers’ compensation coverage 
to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. 

 
    In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including      
   38 obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and   

         legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year.  As a member of OSAG, the   
 District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule.  A portion of the  

         fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District.  The fee for the loss fund is calculated by    
         projecting losses based on the District’s losses for the last five years.  OSAG provides coverage in excess of  
         the loss fund so the District’s liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund.  If the District    
         does not use their loss fund in three years it is returned to them with no interest. 
 
         The District does not make contributions to Oklahoma Employment Security Commission (OESC) for  
         unemployment benefits but reimburses OESC when benefits are paid. There were $652.25 in benefits  
         reimbursed in the 2017-2018 school year. 

 
B.  Contingent Liabilities 

 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, 
principally the federal government.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute 
a liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor 
cannot be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 

C.  Non-Monetary Transactions  
 

The fair market value as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services of the commodities received 
during the period under audit was $47,466.21.

D.  Employee Retirement System and Plan  
 

Description of Plan 
 

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, which is cost-sharing, 
multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system (PERS) administered by the Board of 
Trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (the “System”).  The System provides retirement and 
disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries.  Title 
70 Section 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be amended only through legislative 
action.  The System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required 
supplementary information.  That report may be obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement 
System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling (405) 521-2387. 
 
Basis of Accounting 
 
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of interest 
income.  Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made.  Benefits 
and refunds are recognized when paid.  The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the 
present value of pension benefits.  This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension 
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the 
effect of projected salary increases.  There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts.  
The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation. 

 
Funding Policy 

 
The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee may make contributions.  The contribution 
rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes.  The rates 
are not actuarially determined.  The rates are applied to the employee’s earnings plus employer-paid fringe benefits.  
The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation.   

 
Additionally, OTRS receives “federal matching contributions” for the positions whose funding comes from federal 
sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14% of applicable compensation.  
Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its revenues from sales taxes, 
use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes.  The District contributed 9.5% and the State of 
Oklahoma plus federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% during the year.  The combined state and local 
rate will stabilize at 14%.  The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System to make the 
required contributions on behalf of the participating members.  In addition, the District is required to pay 16.5% 
for any compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits.  
 
Annual Pension Cost  

 
The District’s total contributions for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $669,035, $673,028, and $663,794, respectively.

Notes to the Financial Statements 
June 30, 2018 

 
III.  Other Information (continued) 
 
IV.  Related Party 

 
       The Craig County Educational Facilities Authority was created by Trust Indenture dated July 23, 2012,   
       under the provisions of Title 60, Oklahoma Statutes 2011, Sections 176 to 180.3, inclusive. The Trust was   
       created generally to promote the development of educational, recreational and cultural activities within and   
       near the territorial limits of the County and to thereby provide educational, recreational and cultural activities   
       which will benefit and strengthen culture and the economy of the County of Craig, Oklahoma. The Authority   
       is exempt from State and Federal income taxes. The Authority issued 2012 General Obligation Bonds  
       in the amount of $6,285,000 and 2016 General Obligation Bonds in the amount of $3,715,000 for the purpose  
       of constructing, equipping, repairing and remodeling school buildings, acquiring school furniture, fixtures,  
       and equipment and acquiring and improving school sites. Final maturity of the bond is September 1, 2022 and   
       September 1, 2024. The School will be liable to pay back these monies through bond issues. 

 
V.  Subsequent Events 
 

Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the audit report, which is the date the financial 
statements were available to be issued and have determined that no additional information needs to be added to 
the financial statements. 

 
 
 

VI. Prior-Period Adjustment 
 
 

             A prior-period adjustment was made to remove the LED Light Conversion from FY17 from the capital asset     
             schedule. The LED Light Conversion doesn’t qualify as a capital asset since the individual cost of the lights to not  
             meet the $5,000 threshold set by the District. The LED Light conversion lease should have been classified as an  
             expenditure in FY17 not an asset. The Capital Lease Asset account was reduced (credited) by     
             $198,858.25 and the Fund Balance was reduced (debited) by $198,858.25.

Notes to the Budgetary Information 

For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 
 
 

BUDGETARY INFORMATION 
 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual Estimate of Needs. The annual Estimate of Needs is then 
approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise Board. 
Supplemental appropriations can be made during the year. 

 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods and services. Encumbrance 
accounting – under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the 
applicable fund – is utilized in all Governmental Funds of the District. Purchase orders or contracts document 
encumbrances for goods or purchased services. Under Oklahoma law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at year-end.
