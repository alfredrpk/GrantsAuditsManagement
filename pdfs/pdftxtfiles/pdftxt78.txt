INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

The Honorable Board of Education  
Miami School District No. I-23 
Miami, Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements — regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the 
aggregate remaining fund information of the aforementioned School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the 
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the School District’s basic financial statements as listed in the 
table of contents.  

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with financial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education to meet financial reporting requirements of the State of 
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the financial 
statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with 
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The 
procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the 
entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As discussed in Note I, the financial statements are prepared by the District, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, to comply with the requirements of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The effects on the 
financial statements of the variances between regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I and accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determined, are presumed to be material. 

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In our opinion, because the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles” paragraph, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of the governmental activities, 
each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the District, as of June 30, 2018, the changes in its financial 
position or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended. 

Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In our opinion, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 
financial position – regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund and the aggregate remaining fund information of 
the District, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position – regulatory basis for the year then ended on the 
regulatory basis of accounting described in Note I.

Other Matters 

Other Information  

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the District’s basic 
financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by 
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Guidance Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and 
Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements. Management’s discussion 
and analysis, budgetary comparison information and notes, and the combining financial statements, as listed in the table of contents, 
are presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, and are also not a 
required part of the basic financial statements. 

The schedule of expenditures of federal awards and the combining statements, as listed in the table of contents, are the responsibility 
of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic 
financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial 
statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other 
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards and the combining statements are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the 
basic financial statements as a whole. 

Management’s discussion and analysis and budgetary comparison information and notes, as listed in the table of contents, which are 
the responsibility of management, have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial 
statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards  

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated February 27, 2019, on our consideration of 
the School District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of 
internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal 
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards in considering the School District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE 
AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 

GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education  
Miami School District No. I-23 
Miami, Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the 
financial statements — regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information 
of the aforementioned School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, 
which collectively comprise the School District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated February 27, 
2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States because presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts 
and did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  

Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the School District’s internal control over financial 
reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing 
our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District’s 
internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District’s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the 
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material 
weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant 
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed 
to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, 
during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School District’s financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, 
noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, 
providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such 
an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under 
Government Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of this Report  

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 
testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral 
part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and 
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM  
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education  
Miami School District No. I-23 
Miami, Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program  

We have audited the aforementioned School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB 
Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the School District’s major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018. The School District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of 
the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of its federal awards 
applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the School District’s major federal programs based on our audit 
of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards 
(Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and 
material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the School District’s 
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. However, our 
audit does not provide a legal determination of the School District’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the School District complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that 
could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  

Report on Internal Control over Compliance  

Management of the School District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered the School 
District’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major 
federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with 
the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District’s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control 
over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected 
and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a 
material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant 
deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over 
compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable 
for any other purpose.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
June 30, 2018 

 
As management of the Miami School District No. I-23 (District), we offer readers of the District’s financial statements 
this narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities of the District for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The 
intent of this discussion and analysis is to look at the District’s financial performance as a whole; readers should also 
review the basic financial statements and the notes to the basic financial statements to enhance their understanding of the 
District’s financial performance.   
 
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
 

• The total net position of the District decreased by $238,670 or 1.1% over the fiscal year.  
 

• General revenues accounted for $15,387,438 or 86% of total governmental activities revenue. Program specific 
revenues accounted for $2,543,098 or 14% of total governmental activities revenue. 

 
• The District had $18,169,206 in expenses related to governmental activities: $2,543,098 of these expenses was 

offset by program specific charges for services, grants or contributions. The remaining expenses of the 
governmental activities were offset by property tax levies, state and county sources, and other miscellaneous 
sources. 
 

• Governmental activities capital assets increased by $1,341,391 primarily due to the construction in progress from 
the 2016 Bond Issue and purchase of a 2018 Ford Transit Van, 2019 International Bus, Laser Machine, Serving 
Line Counter at Washington Elementary, Grease Tank at Wilson Elementary, Wrestling Floor, HVAC Unit at 
High School, HVAC Unit at High School Library and a parcel of land at 112 F Street NE. Purchases were also 
offset by current year depreciation. 
 

Overview of the Financial Statements 
 
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the District’s basic financial statements. The 
District’s financial statements are comprised of three components: 1) government-wide financial statements, 2) fund 
financial statements, and 3) notes to the financial statements. This report also contains other supplementary information. 
 
Government –wide financial statements - The government-wide financial statements are designed to provide readers 
with a broad overview of the District’s finances, in a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
 
 The Statement of Net Position presents information on all of the District’s assets and liabilities with a difference between 
the two reported as net position. Over time, increase or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of 
whether the financial position of the District is improving or deteriorating. 
 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the District’s net position changed during the most recent 
year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlining event given rise to the change occurs, regardless 
of the timing of the related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses are reported in this statements for some items that 
will only result in cash flows in future fiscal periods.(e.g., reserves paid in the following year). 
 
The government-wide financial statements distinguish functions of the District that are principally supported by taxes and 
intergovernmental revenues from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant portion of their costs 
through user fees and charges. The government-wide financial statements can be found on pages 17-18 of this report

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 
June 30, 2018 

 
Fund financial statements – A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used to maintain control over resources that 
have been segregated for specific activities or objectives. The District, like other state and local governments, uses fund 
accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds of the District 
can be divided into two categories –governmental funds and  
fiduciary funds. 
 
Governmental Funds- Governmental funds are used to account for essentially the same functions reported as 
governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial 
statements, governmental find financial statements focus on current sources and uses of spendable resources, as well as on 
balances on spendable resources available at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluation a 
government’s near-term financing requirements. 
 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-wide financial statements, it is useful to 
compare the information presented for governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities 
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better understand the long-term effect of the 
government’s near-term financing decision. Both the governmental funds balance sheet and the governmental fund 
statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances provide a reconciliation to facilitate this comparison 
between governmental funds and governmental activities. 
 
The District maintains five individual governmental funds. Information is presented separately in the Governmental Fund 
Balance Sheet and in the Governmental Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balances for the 
General, Building and Child Nutrition funds, all of which are considered to be major funds. Data from the other three 
funds are combined into a single, aggregated presentation. Individual fund data for each of these non-major governmental 
funds is provided in the form of combing statements elsewhere in this report.  
 
The District adopts an annual appropriated budget for its General Fund and Special Revenue (Building and Child 
Nutrition Funds). Budgetary comparison schedules have been provided for the major funds to demonstrate compliance 
with the budget and are presented as required supplemental information. 
 
The basic governmental fund financial statements can be found on pages 19-22 of this report. 
 
Fiduciary Funds – Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the District. 
Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the government-wide financial statements because the resources of these funds are not 
available to support the District’s own programs. 

 
 

The District uses an agency fund to account for resources held for student activities and groups. The basic fiduciary fund 
financial statement can be found on pages 23-25 of this report. 

 
 

Notes to the Financial Statements –The notes provide additional information that is essential to a full understanding of 
the data provided in the government-wide and fund financial statements. The notes to the financial statements can be 
found on pages 26-40 of this report.

Economic Factors and Next Year’s Budgets and Rates 
 
In the 2018-19 Budget, General Fund revenues are budgeted to decrease from the 2017-18 Budget. General property taxes 
as certified assessed valuations have increased over this year. The State sources of revenue make up 70% of General fund 
revenues and have decreased by 4% from the preceding year. This revenue source is the most volatile and subject to 
decline if the State of Oklahoma is unable to supplement its income.  
 
As a result of the potential impact in revenue, the District has made a concerted effort to limit appropriations to only those 
items truly necessary.

Miami School District No. I-23 
Ottawa County, Oklahoma 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
 June 30, 2018 

 
I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

The accompanying financial statements of the Miami School District, No. I-65, Ottawa County, Oklahoma (the 
“District”) conform to the regulatory basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive basis of accounting 
prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education and conforms to the system of accounting authorized by 
the State of Oklahoma.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not intended to present the financial 
position and results of operations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America.  The District’s accounting policies are described in the following notes that are an integral part of the 
District’s financial statements. 

 
A.  Reporting Entity 

 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and 
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  The District is part of the public 
school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is 
financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support.  The general operating authority for the public school system 
is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education (Board) composed of five elected members.  The 
appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.  The Board, constituting an on-going entity, is the 
level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public elementary and 
secondary school education within the jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District.  The Board receives 
funding from local, state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of these funding 
source entities.  However, the Board is not included in any other governmental “reporting entity” as defined in 
Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, since Board members 
are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to designate management, the 
responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters. 

 
B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting 

 
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is, in substance, the format established 
by GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis for State and 
Local Governments. 
 
As the basis of accounting, the basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) 
as follows:

I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the expenditure of 
monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

•    Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
•    Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as assets. 
•    Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
•    Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
•    Compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the obligation is paid. 
•    Capital assets are recorded when acquired and depreciated over their useful lives. 

 
 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when they are 
earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental 
fund types; and when revenues are earned and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds. 
 
The Fund financial conform to the regulatory (statutory) basis of accounting, which is another comprehensive 
basis of accounting other than general accepted accounting principles. The accounting policies are prescribed by 
the Oklahoma Department of Education and conform to the system of accounting authorized by the State of 
Oklahoma.  
 
The District’s basic financial statements include both government-wide (reporting the District as a whole), 
including a statement of net position and a statement of activities, and fund financial statements (reporting the 
District’s major funds), which provide a more detailed level of financial information.  Both the government-wide 
and fund financial statements categorize primary activities as either governmental or business type.  The District 
does not have any activities classified as business-type activities.  
 
Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurements made, regardless of the measurement focus applied.  
Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures or expenses are recognized in the accounts and 
reported in the financial statements. 
 
Government – Wide Financial Statements 
 
The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities display information on all of the non-fiduciary 
activities of the District. 
   
The Statement of Activities and Changes in Net Position demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of 
a given function or activities are offset by program revenues.  Direct expenses are those that are clearly 
identifiable within a specific function or activity.  Program revenues include charges to customers who purchase, 
use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or privileges provided by a given function or activity. In addition, 
program revenues include grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital 
requirements of a particular function or activity.  Taxes and other items not properly included among program 
revenues are reported instead as general revenues.

I.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

B.  Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 

The Government-Wide Financial Statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting.  The Government-
Wide focus is more on the sustainability of the District as an entity and the change in the District’s net assets 
resulting from the current year’s activities. 
 
Fund Financial Statements 
 
The Balance Sheet and the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances are also provided 
for all of the governmental funds of the District.  The District’s major individual governmental funds are reported as 
separate columns in the fund financial statements.  Nonmajor funds are aggregated and presented in a single 
column.  Fiduciary funds are reported separately from governmental funds. 
 
Fund Accounting - The accounts of the District are organized and operated on the basis of funds and account 
groups.  A fund is an independent fiscal accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  Fund accounting 
segregates funds according to their intended purpose and is used to aid management in demonstrating compliance 
with finance-related legal and contractual provisions.  The minimum number of funds is maintained consistent with 
legal and managerial requirements. The two categories of funds are governmental and fiduciary. 
 
Governmental Funds - are used to account for most of the District’s general activities, including the collection and 
disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets 
(capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds). Governmental fund types 
use the Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting, which is primarily cash receipts and disbursements with certain 
modifications as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. If the District utilized 
the basis of accounting recognized as generally accepted, the governmental funds would use the modified accrual 
basis of accounting based on the flow of current financial resources measurement focus recognizing revenues when 
susceptible to accrual (i.e., when they become measurable and available, normally considered available if collected 
within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period). As a result, Ad valorem taxes on real and personal property 
associated with the current fiscal period and all other revenue items as recorded as revenues when collected rather 
than when “measurable” and “available”. Entitlements, grants and shared revenues are recorded at the time of 
receipt. Expenditures are generally recognized when encumbered or reserved rather than at the time the related 
liability is incurred. Unmatured interest for debt service is recognized when due and certain compensated absences 
and claims and judgements which are recognized when the obligations are expended to be liquidated with 
expendable available financial resources. Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. 
These practices differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
 
The following are the District’s major governmental funds: 

 
General Fund - is the general operating fund of the District.  It accounts for all financial resources of the 
District, except those required to be accounted for in another fund.  This is a budgeted fund, and any fund 
balances are considered as resources available for use.  Major revenue sources include local property taxes 
and federal and state funding.  Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the 
schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt 
service on bonds and other long-term debt.  The General Fund also accounts for federal and state financed 
programs where restricted monies must be expended for specific programs. Project accounting is employed to 
maintain integrity for the various sources of these funds.

B. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting and Basis of Presentation – Fund Accounting (continued) 
 
 

Special Revenue Funds - account for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific purposes 
(not including expendable trusts or major capital projects).  The special revenue funds are composed of the 
District's Building and Child Nutrition Funds.  These are budgeted funds and any fund balances are 
considered as resources available for use. 
 
Building Fund - The Building Fund consists mainly of monies derived from property taxes levied for the 
purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing or maintaining school buildings and for purchasing furniture, 
equipment and computer software to be used on or for school district property, for paying energy and utility 
costs, for purchasing telecommunications services, for paying fire and casualty insurance premiums for school 
facilities, for purchasing security systems, and for paying salaries of security personnel. 
 

Other governmental funds of the District that are considered non-major funds include: 
 
Capital Projects Fund – is the District’s Bond Fund and is used to account for the proceeds of bond sales used 
exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing 
facilities, acquisition of technical equipment and acquiring transportation equipment. 
 
Debt Service Fund - is the District’s Sinking Fund and accounts for the accumulation of financial resources 
for servicing of general long-term debt (principal, interest and related costs). This is a budgeted fund. The 
primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied for debt service. 
 
Special Revenue Funds - account for revenue sources that are restricted to expenditures for specific purposes 
(not including expendable trusts or major capital projects). The special revenue funds are composed of the 
District's Building and Child Nutrition Funds. These are budgeted funds and any fund balances are considered 
as resources available for use. 
 
Child Nutrition Fund - consists of monies derived from federal and state financial assistance and food sales. 
This fund is used to account for the operations of the school cafeteria. 
 

Fiduciary Funds - are used to account for assets held by the District in a trustee capacity or as an agent on behalf 
of others. 
 
Agency Fund - is custodial in nature and does not present results of operations. Agency Funds are accounted 
for using the cash basis of accounting. This fund is the School Activities Fund which is used to account for 
monies collected principally through fund raising efforts of the students and District – sponsored groups. This 
is not a budgeted fund. The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, 
disbursing and accounting for these activity funds. These funds have no equity, assets are equal to liabilities, 
and do not include revenues and expenditures for general operation of the District.

I. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 
 

1. Deposits and Investments 
 

State statutes govern the District’s investment policy. Permissible investments include direct obligations of the 
United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank and 
trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations and trust 
companies. Collateral is required for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered 
by federal deposit insurance. Investments are stated at cost. The District invests entirely in certificates of 
deposit, U.S. Treasury Securities, and participates in the Secured Investment Program of Oklahoma State 
School Boards Association, as authorized by Oklahoma Statutes Title 62, Section 348. 

 
2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 
The District’s financial instruments include cash and investments. The District’s estimate of the fair value of 
all financial instruments does not differ materially from the aggregate carrying values of its financial 
instruments recorded in the accompanying balance sheet. The carrying amount of these financial instruments 
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

 
3. Estimates 
 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. 
Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 
4. Interfund Transactions 

 
Interfund transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute 
reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to 
another fund are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. Non-recurring or non-
routine permanent transfers of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. 

 
5. Inventories 

 
The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018, is not material to the financial statements. Acquisitions 
are considered expenditures at the time of purchase and are not recorded for financial statement purposes. 

 
6. Capital Assets 

 
Capital assets, which include property, plant and equipment, are reported in the Government-Wide Financial 
Statements. Capital assets are defined by the District as assets with an initial, individual cost of more than 
$5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or 
estimated historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are reported at estimated fair 
market value at the date of donation.

C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 
 
6. Capital Assets (continued) 

 
The cost of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the asset or materially extend asset 
lives are not capitalized. 

 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as projects are constructed. 

 
All reported capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful 
lives: buildings and improvements (15-60 years); transportation equipment (5-15 years); equipment (5-15 
years). 

 
7. Compensated Absences 

 
The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in accordance with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, 
Article 6-104, which provides for annual sick leave and personal business days. District policy allows 
personnel to accumulate or bank such days to a maximum of days. Upon retirement, sick leave is paid out to 
the employee based on the number of unused sick days within the current year plus the amount of sick days 
that have accumulated up to the maximum of 180 days. The rate in which the employee is compensated for the 
unused sick days is equal to $20.00 for each full day. Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected 
in the financial statements because such statements are prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. This 
practice differs from generally accepted accounting principles. 

 
8. Long-Term Obligations 

 
In the Government-Wide Financial Statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are reported as 
liabilities in the applicable Statement of Net Position.  

 
 

9. Net Position/Fund Balances 
 

In the government-wide financial statement, net position represents the difference between assets and 
liabilities. Net investment in capital assets, consists of capital assets, reduced by the outstanding balances of 
any borrowing used for the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. Net position is reported 
as restricted when limitations on their use change the nature or normal understanding of the availability of the 
asset. Such constraints are either externally imposed by creditors, contributors, grantors, laws or other 
governments, or are imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.  
 
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances. The hierarchy is 
based primarily on the degree of spending constraints places on the use of resources for specific purposed 
versus availability of appropriation. An important distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between 
amounts that are considered nonspendable (i.e, fund balance associated with assets that are not in spendable 
form, such as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or items that are 
legally required to be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund)) and those that are spendable 
(such as fund balance associated with cash, investments or receivables).

9. Net Position/Fund Balances (continued) 
 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, assigned or 
unassigned, as appropriate. 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors (such as debt 
covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other governments; or by law through 
constitutional provision or enabling legislation. 

Committed fund balance represents amounts that are usable only for specific purposes by formal action of the 
government’s highest level of decision making authority. Such amounts are not subject to legal enforceability 
(like restricted amounts) but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government removes or changes 
by taking action similar to that which imposed the commitment. The District’s Board of Education is the 
highest level of decision making authority of the District. 

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes but are neither 
restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-level body or 
official who the governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. 
Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable amounts (except negative balances) that are reported 
in governmental funds other than the general fund, that are neither restricted nor committed, and amounts in 
the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance with the provisions of the 
standard. 

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. It represents the amounts that have 
not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes 
within the general fund. 

 
10. Property Taxes and Other Local Revenues 

 
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and 
personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from 
the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer. 
Property taxes are levied on November 1 and are due on receipt of the tax bill. The first half of taxes is due 
prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1. If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax 
becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following 
the assessment. If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of the 
taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end 
of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property. No provision has been 
made for uncollected taxes, as all taxes are deemed collectible. Other local sources of revenues include tuition, 
fees, rentals, disposals, commissions and reimbursements. 

 
11. Intermediate Revenues 

 
Revenue from intermediate sources is the amount of money from funds collected by an intermediate 
administrative unit, or a political subdivision between the district and the state and distributed to districts in 
amounts that differ in proportion to those which were collected within such systems.

I. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) 
 

C. Assets, Liabilities, Fund Balance, Revenue and Expenditures (continued) 
 

12. State Revenues  
 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State 
Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs be expended only for the program 
for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be 
carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State 
Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the 
general fund.  
 
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by state aid formula under the 
provisions of Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid 
funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts. After review and verification of 
reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period 
allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally such adjustments are treated as 
reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 

 
13. Federal Revenues 

 
Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government in the form of operating grants or 
entitlements. An operating grant is a contribution to be used for a specific purpose, activity or facility. A grant 
may be received either directly from the federal government or indirectly as a pass through from another 
government, such as the state. Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the District is entitled pursuant 
to an allocation formula contained in applicable statutes. The majority of federal revenues received by the 
District are apportioned to the general fund. The district maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the 
federal revenues received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

 
 

14. Non-Monetary Resources 
 

The District receives commodities from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The value of these commodities 
have been included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. 

 
15. Resource Use Policy 

 
It is in the District’s policy for all funds that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which 
both restricted and unrestricted resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers the 
restricted amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used. Furthermore, it is the District’s 
policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which committed, assigned or unassigned 
resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers committed, amounts to be spent first, 
followed by assigned amounts, and lastly, unassigned amounts.

III. Other Information 
 

A. Risk Management 
 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction of assets; 
errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District is a member of Oklahoma Schools 
Insurance Group (OSIG) and purchases commercial insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto 
liability, property damage, and public officials liability. The District and all other OSIG members had the 
following insurance coverage during the year: commercial property-$1,000,000,000; general liability -
$1,000,000; and educator’s liability- $1,000,000. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the 
commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 

 
The District also participates in a risk pool for Workers’ Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or 
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with GASB No. 10, the District reports the 
required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the Oklahoma School 
Assurance Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers’ compensation 
coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. 

 
In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including 
obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal 
defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is 
required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by 
the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based 
on the District’s losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the loss fund so the 
District’s liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use their loss 
fund in three years it is returned to them with no interest. 
 
The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation Account 
(OPSUCA). In this program the District is required to maintain a minimum finding level for unemployment 
insurance. At June 30, 2018, the District had $19,000 in deposits with the OPSUCA and had claims in 2017 – 
2018 totaling $9,716.77. The funds for each district are kept separate and districts can contribute more of their 
payroll if they elect to. The money contributed by each District earns interest and is fully insured. If the District 
has claims in excess of the amount in their account they would be liable for the excess. 

 
B. Contingent Liabilities 

 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, 
principally the federal government. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute 
a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor 
cannot be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, to be  immaterial. 

    
   C. Non-Monetary Transactions  
 

The fair market value as determined by the Oklahoma Department of Human Services of the commodities 
received during the period under audit was $86,163.02.

D. Employee Retirement System and Plan  
 

Description of Plan 
 

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, which is cost-sharing, 
multiple-employer defined benefit public employee retirement system (PERS) administered by the Board of 
Trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System (the “System”). The System provides retirement and 
disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Title 
70 Section 17 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be amended only through 
legislative action. The System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and 
required supplementary information. That report may be obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers’ 
Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling (405) 521-2387. 

 
Basis of Accounting 

 
The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of accounting, except for accruals of interest 
income. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made. Benefits 
and refunds are recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the 
present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension 
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the 
effect of projected salary increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. 
The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest actuarial valuation.

D. Employee Retirement System and Plan (continued) 
 

Funding Policy 
 

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee may make contributions. The contribution 
rates for the District and its employees are established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes. The rates 
are not actuarially determined. The rates are applied to the employee’s earnings plus employer-paid fringe 
benefits. The required contribution for the participating members is 7.0% of compensation.  
 
Additionally, OTRS receives “federal matching contributions” for the positions whose funding comes from 
federal sources or certain grants. The District and State are required to contribute 14% of applicable 
compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54% of its revenues 
from sales taxes, use taxes, corporate income taxes and individual income taxes. The District contributed 9.5% 
and the State of Oklahoma plus federal contribution contributed the remaining 4.5% during the year. The 
combined state and local rate will stabilize at 14%. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher’s 
Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating members. In addition, the 
District is required to pay 16.5% for any compensated retired teachers already receiving retirement benefits.  
 
Annual Pension Cost  

 
The District’s total contributions for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $864,593, $952,918, and $967,934, respectively.

Notes to the Budgetary Information 

For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 
 
 
 

BUDGETARY INFORMATION 
 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual Estimate of Needs. The annual Estimate of Needs is then 
approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County Clerk and approved by the County Excise Board. 
Supplemental appropriations can be made during the year. 

 
Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods and services. Encumbrance 
accounting – under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded as expenditures of the 
applicable fund – is utilized in all Governmental Funds of the District. Purchase orders or contracts document 
encumbrances for goods or purchased services. Under Oklahoma law, unencumbered appropriations lapse at year-end.
