INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT 

 

To the Board of Directors 

Housing Authority of the City of Miami 

Miami, Oklahoma 

 

Report on the Financial Statements 

 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Housing 

Authority of the City of Miami, as of and for the fiscal year ended September 

30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements.  

 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these 

financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally 

accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 

implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the 

preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements that are free 

from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 

based on our audit.  We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing 

standards generally accepted in the United States of America, and the 

standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 

Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and in 

accordance with Oklahoma Statutes. Those standards require that we plan and 

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 

statements are free of material misstatement.  

 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 

amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  The procedures selected 

depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 

material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 

error.  In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal 

control relevant to the Authority’s preparation and fair presentation of the 

financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 

in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 

effectiveness of the Authority’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express 

no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of 

accounting policies used, and the reasonableness of significant accounting 

estimates made, by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 

of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 

appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

 

Opinion 

 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 

all material respects, the respective financial position of the Housing 

Authority of the City of Miami, as of September 30, 2018, and the respective 

changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for 

the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally 

accepted in the United States of America. 

 

Other Matters 

 

Required Supplementary Information 

 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America 

require that the management’s discussion and analysis as listed in the table 

of contents be presented to supplement the basic financial statements.  Such 

information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is 

required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to 

be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial 

statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context.  

We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary 

information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the 

United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about 

the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for 

consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial 

statements, and other knowledge we obtained during out audit of the basic 

financial statements.  We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance 

on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with 

sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.   

 

Other Information 

 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the 

financial statements that collectively comprise the Housing Authority of the 

City of Miami’s basic financial statements.  The accompanying schedule of 

expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 

Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, 

and Audit Requirement for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) and Financial 

Data Schedule, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not 

a required part of the basic financial statements of the Housing Authority of 

the City of Miami.

Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and 

relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to 

prepare the consolidated financial statements.  The information has been 

subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial 

statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 

reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other

standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our 

opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in

presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part 

of the basic financial statements of the Authority.  Such additional 

information has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our 

audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express 

an opinion or provide any assurance on it.  

 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our 

report dated March 19, 2019, on our consideration of the Housing Authority of 

the City of Miami’s internal control over financial reporting and on our 

tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 

contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report 

is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over 

financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not 

to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Housing Authority of the 

City of Miami’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance.  

That report is an integral part of an audit performed in compliance with 

Government Auditing Standards in considering Housing Authority of the City of 

Miami’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis 

September 30, 2018 

 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is an element of the reporting model adopted by the 

Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in their Statement No. 34 Basic Financial 

Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local Governments issued 

June 1999.  

 
 

Financial Highlights 
The most significant changes on the 2018 financial statements were in changes in net position. 

 

 

Overview of the Financial Statements 
The annual report includes a Management Discussion and Analysis report, the Basic Financial 

Statements, the Notes to the Financial Statements, and the Financial Data Schedule (FDS) as referenced 

in the section of Supplemental Information Required by HUD.  The financial statements are presented as 

fund level financial statements because the Housing Authority only has proprietary funds. 

 

The financial statements report information using accounting methods like those used by private sector 

companies.  These statements offer short-term and long-term financial information about the Housing 

Authority’s activities.  The Statement of Net Position includes assets and liabilities plus provides 

information about the nature and amounts of investments in resources (assets) and obligations to 

creditors (liabilities).  It also provides the basis for evaluating capital structure to include assessing 

liquidity and financial flexibility. 

 

For accounting purposes, the Housing Authority is classified as an enterprise fund.  Enterprise funds 

account for activities like those found in the private business sector where the determination of net 

position is necessary or useful to sound financial administration.  Enterprise funds are reported using the 

full accrual method of accounting in which assets and liabilities, associated with the operation of these 

funds, are included on the balance sheet.  Their focus is on income measurement which, together with 

the maintenance of equity, is an important financial indicator.  Our discussion and analysis provides an 

overview of the financial activities and performance for year-end September 30, 2018. 

 

All the current year’s revenues and expenses are accounted for in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, 

and Changes in Fund Net Position.  This statement measures the ability of management to meet budgets, 

maintain property (meets HUD specifications and inspections), and determines whether the Housing 

Authority has successfully recovered costs through its rental fees and other charges.  It can also be used 

to measure profitability and credit worthiness. 

 

The Statement of Cash Flows reports cash receipts, cash payments, and net changes in cash resulting 

from operating, investing, and financing activities.  It also provides answers to such questions as the 

source, spending, and change in cash during the reporting period.

The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to a full 

understanding of the data provided in the basic financial statements. 

 

The section Supplemental Information Required by HUD contains the Financial Data Schedule (FDS).  

HUD has established Uniform Financial Reporting Standards that require the Housing Authority to 

submit financial information electronically to HUD using the FDS format. 

 

Financial Analysis 
One of the most important questions concerning finances is the following; “Is the Housing Authority as 

a whole better, or worse, because of the achievements of the reported fiscal year?” The purpose of the 

information presented in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis is to assist the reader in answering 

this question. 

 

The basic financial statements are the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Revenues, 

Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position.  The Statement of Net Position provides a summary of 

assets and liabilities as of the close of business on September 30, 2018. The Statement of Revenues, 

Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position summarize the revenues, and sources of those revenues 

generated, and the expenses incurred in operating the Housing Authority for the year-ended September 

30, 2018. 

 

Miami Housing Authority has a low-rent program that provides housing for qualified tenants, a capital 

fund program for improvements to its low-rent property, and a Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher 

program that provides rental assistance to qualified individuals living in private housing.  The following 

analysis focuses on the net position and the change in net position not the individual programs.

    Net Capital Assets $ 4,121,763   $ 4,477,338   $ (355,575)  -7.94% 

 

 

Net Position 
Total assets consist of current and capital assets.  Current assets are resources that are reasonably 

expected, based on plans and intentions, to be converted into cash or its equivalent during the current 

operating cycle.  Capital assets are long-term tangible assets obtained because of past transactions, 

events, or circumstances and include buildings, equipment, and improvements to buildings and land. 

 

Total liabilities consist of current and noncurrent payables.  Current liabilities are current debts that are 

owed and due within 12 months.  It is expected that current liabilities will consume current financial 

resources to satisfy debt.  Noncurrent liabilities are debts that are owed but not due within 12 months. It 

is not expected that these liabilities will consume current financial resources to satisfy the debt. 

 

Annual depreciation exceeded capital additions which decreased total assets.  Total liabilities decreased 

due to payment in lieu of taxes. 

 

The Housing Authority had $392,485 in Capital Grant revenue to draw down and spend in the future. 
 

Total Net Position 
As of September 30, 2018, the Housing Authority had $4,724,195 invested in total net position.  Of this 

amount, $516,247 of unrestricted net position may be used to meet the Authority’s future ongoing 

expenses and obligations.  Restricted net position of $86,185 was available for Section 8 Housing

land, buildings, furnishings, leasehold improvements, equipment, and construction in progress.

Number of Months Expendable Fund  5.64    5.40    0.25   4.58% 

 

Expendable Fund Balance 

If current assets, less materials inventory, were converted to cash and all current liabilities were paid, the 

Authority’s cash balance (expendable fund balance) would be $582,761 which decreased $1,411.  

 

Number of Months Expendable Fund Balance 
The expendable fund balance is divided by average monthly expense (total expenses for the year, less 

depreciation, divided by twelve (12) to determine the number of months expendable fund balance.  This 

factor indicates the number of months the entity could operate without relying on additional funding.  As 

of the fiscal year-end, the Authority could continue operations for 5.64 months.

Changes in Net Position 
Total revenue increased due to operating revenues received in 2018 as compared to 2019 and capital 

grant projects in progress.  Total operating expenses decreased due to general maintenance repairs and 

average monthly Section 8 HAP costs per unit leased.  The net effect was an increase in changes in net 

position. 

 

Investment revenue and other income along with tenant service expense, protective service expense, and 

expenses for casualty losses had minimal effects on the 2018 financial statements which were not 

included in the following graphs.

NOTE 1 – THE REPORTING ENTITY 

 

The agency was created under the provisions of the laws of the 

State of Oklahoma.  The purpose of the agency is to administer 

Public Housing Programs authorized by the United States Housing 

Act.  The governing board is appointed by the Mayor of the City 

of Miami.  The governing board employs executives; authorizes 

contracts of subsidy with the U.S. Department of Housing and 

Urban Development (Annual Contributions Contract) pursuant to 

that agency’s regulations and statutory authorizations; and 

causes the agency to construct, own, and operate public housing 

facilities.  The financial liability of the housing agency is 

essentially supported by the operating and debt service subsidies 

received under contract from the Federal government. 

 

Generally accepted accounting principles require that the 

financial statements present the accounts and operations of the 

entity and its component units, entities for which the entity is 

considered to be financially accountable.  Blended component 

units, although legally separate entities, are, in substance, 

part of the entity’s operations.  If component units exist, data 

from these units are combined with data from the entity.  Each 

discretely presented component unit, if any, would be reported in 

a separate column in the combined financial statements to 

emphasize that it is legally separate from the entity.  As of 

September 30, 2018, and for the fiscal year then ended, the 

entity had no discretely presented component units or any 

component units required to be blended in these financial 

statements. 

 

NOTE 2 – BASIS OF ACCOUNTING 

 

The Housing Authority of the City of Miami uses a Proprietary 

Fund Type to account for the activities of the housing authority 

in a manner similar to commercial enterprises.  This proprietary 

fund is accounted for using the economic resources measurement 

focus.  Accordingly, this fund reports all assets and liabilities 

on the balance sheet.  The reported fund equity is segregated 

into contributed capital and retained earnings components.  

Proprietary fund operating statements present increases 

(revenues) and decreases (expenses) in net assets.  This fund 

uses the accrual basis of accounting.  Revenues are recognized 

when earned and become measurable and expenses are recognized 

when incurred, if measurable.  The Housing Authority applies all 

applicable accounting and financial reporting standards of the 



HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF MIAMI 

MIAMI, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 
 

18 

 

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued through 

November 30, 1989, in accounting and reporting for its 

proprietary fund. 

 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with 

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 

America requires management to make estimates and assumptions 

that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 

disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of 

the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 

expenses during the accounting period.  Actual results could 

differ from those estimates. 

 

Budgetary Information – Annual budgets are adopted, as required 

by HUD Annual Contributions Contracts, for the Owned Rental 

Housing and Section 8 Programs.  Annual budgets are not required 

for Comprehensive Improvement Grants.  These budgets are prepared 

on a regulatory basis (HUD) and do not contain certain accounts 

as required by generally accepted accounting principles, such as 

Provision for Uncollectible Accounts, Depreciation, and certain 

accruals. 

 

Cash Equivalents – For purposes of reporting cash flows, all 

highly liquid investments (including restricted assets) with a 

maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash 

equivalents. 

 

Investments – Investments are reported at fair value.  

Investments consist of Certificates of Deposit which are reported 

at carrying amount which reasonably estimates fair value. 

 

Inventories – Inventories consist of expendable supplies held for 

consumption.  They are valued at cost (first-in, first-out), 

which is less than the current market value.   

 

Prepaid Expenses – Certain payments to vendors reflect costs 

applicable to future periods.  These payments are recorded as 

prepaid expenses. 

 

Capital Assets – capital assets are valued at historical cost.  

It is the policy of the Housing Authority to capitalize all 

assets with a cost of $500 or greater.  Donated capital assets 

are valued at the estimated fair value at the date of the 

donation.  Depreciation of all exhaustible capital assets is 

charged as an expense against operations.  Accumulated 



HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF MIAMI 

MIAMI, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

SEPTEMBER 30, 2018

depreciation is reported on the balance sheet.  Depreciation is 

provided over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line 

method.  Estimated useful lives, in years, for depreciable assets 

are as follow: 

 

 Dwelling Structures    15-40 years 

 Non-dwelling Structures      40 years 

 Equipment                 3-5 years 

 

Compensated Absences – It is the Housing Authority’s policy to 

allow employees to accumulate earned but unused vacation and sick 

pay benefits up to certain limits.  These amounts are charged to 

expense and a corresponding liability is established when earned.  

 

NOTE 3 – CASH 

 

At September 30, 2018, the Authority held deposits of approximately 

$678,473 at financial institutions.  The Authority’s cash deposits, 

including interest-bearing certificates of deposit are covered by 

Federal Depository Insurance (FDIC) or collateralized with securities 

held by the Authority or by its agent in the Authority’s name.   

 

Investment Interest Rate Risk 

 

The Authority does not have a formal investment policy that limits 

investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair 

value losses arising from increasing interest rates. 

 

Investment Credit Risk 

 

The Authority has no policy that limits its investment choices other 

than the limitation of state law as follows: 

a. Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and 

instrumentalities to which the full faith and credit of the U.S. 

Government is pledged, or obligations to the payment of which 

the full faith and credit of the State is pledged. 

b. Certificates of deposits or savings accounts that are either 

insured or secured with acceptable collateral with in-state 

financial institutions, and fully insured certificates of 

deposit or savings accounts in out-of-state financial 

institutions. 

c. With certain limitation, negotiable certificates of deposit, 

prime bankers’ acceptances, prime commercial paper and 

repurchase agreements with certain limitations.

d. County, municipal or school district tax supported debt 

obligations, bond or revenue anticipation notes, money 

judgments, or bond or revenue anticipation notes of public 

trusts whose beneficiary is a county, municipality or school 

district. 

e. Notes or bonds secured by mortgage or trust deed insured by the 

Federal Housing Administrator and debentures issued by the 

Federal Housing Administrator, and in obligations of the 

National Mortgage Association. 

f. Money market funds regulated by the SEC and in which investments 

consist of the investments mentioned in the previous paragraphs 

(a.-d.). 

 

NOTE 4 – ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 

 

All receivables from tenants are for rentals and service charges.  

These receivables are shown net of an allowance for uncollectible 

amounts.  This amount is estimated based upon historical 

information.  The allowance is $1,162 at September 30, 2018. 

 

NOTE 5 – CAPITAL ASSETS 

 

Capital assets are valued at historical cost.  Donated capital 

assets are valued at the estimated fair value at the date of 

donation.  Depreciation of all exhaustible capital assets is 

charged as an expense against operations.  Accumulated 

depreciation is reported on the statement of net position.  

Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives using 

the straight-line method.  Depreciation expense for September 30, 

2018 is $392,383.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 

REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING 

STANDARDS 

 

To the Board of Directors 

Housing Authority of the City of Miami 

Miami, Oklahoma 

 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally 

accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable 

to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued 

by the Comptroller General of the United States, and in accordance 

with Oklahoma Statutes, the financial statements of the Housing 

Authority of the City of Miami, as of and for the year ended September 

30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements,  which 

collectively comprise the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s 

basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated 

March 19, 2019.   

 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we 

considered the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s internal 

control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the 

audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 

purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not 

for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 

Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s internal control.  

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 

Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s internal control. 

 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation 

of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal 

course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect 

and correct misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a 

deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such 

that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of 

the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected 

and corrected on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency is a 

deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that 

is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit 

attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose 

described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed 

to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 

material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  Given these 

limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in 

internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 

material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.   

 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Housing 

Authority of the City of Miami’s financial statements are free of 

material misstatement, we performed tests of compliance with certain 

provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements, 

noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on 

the determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing 

an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of 

our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  The 

results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other 

matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 

Standards.   

 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our 

testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that 

testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 

entity’s internal control or on compliance.  This report is an 

integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government 

Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and 

compliance.  Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any 

other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL 

PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY 

UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

 

To the Board of Directors 

Housing Authority of the City of Miami 

 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s 

compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the 

OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect 

on each of the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s major federal 

programs for the year ended September 30, 2018.  The Housing Authority 

of the City of Miami’s major federal programs are identified in the 

summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of 

findings and questioned costs.   

 

Management’s Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of 

laws, regulations, contracts and grants applicable to its federal 

programs.   

 

Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of 

the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s major federal programs 

based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to 

above.  We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance auditing 

standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 

standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 

Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 

States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 

Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 

Principles, and the Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform 

Guidance), and in accordance with Oklahoma Statutes.  Those standards 

and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to 

obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types 

of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 

and material effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit 

includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Housing 

Authority of the City of Miami’s compliance with those requirements 

and performing such other procedures, as we considered necessary in 

the circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

on compliance for each major federal program.  However, our audit does 

not provide a legal determination on Housing Authority of the City of 

Miami’s compliance. 

 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, the Housing Authority of the City of Miami complied, 

in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 

referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each 

of its major federal programs for the year ended September 30, 2018.   

 

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the Housing Authority of the City of Miami is 

responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal 

control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements 

referred to above.  In planning and performing our audit of 

compliance, we considered the Housing Authority of the City of Miami’s 

internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that 

could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program 

to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the 

circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on compliance 

for each major federal program and to test and report on internal 

control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not 

for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 

internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an 

opinion on the effectiveness of the Housing Authority of the City of 

Miami’s internal control over compliance. 

 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the 

design or operation of a control does not allow management or 

employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 

functions, to prevent, or to detect and correct, noncompliance with a 

type of compliance requirement of a federal program a timely basis.  A 

material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 

or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, 

such that there is a reasonable possibility that material 

noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 

program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely 

basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance 

is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 

over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 

program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal

those charged with governance.   

 

Our consideration of the internal control over compliance was for the 

limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 

was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 

compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant 

deficiencies.  We did not identify any deficiencies in internal 

control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  

However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is 

solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over 

compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements 

of the Uniform Guidance.  Accordingly, this report is not suitable for 

any other purpose.
