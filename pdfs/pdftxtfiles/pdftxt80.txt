INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Midwest City-Del City School District No. I-52 
Midwest City, Oklahoma 73110 

Report on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activmes, each major fund and the 
aggregate remaining fund information of Midwest City-Del City School District No. I-52, Midwest City, Oklahoma (the 
"School District") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which 
collectively comprise the School District's basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits 
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. 
The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of 
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies 
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation ofthe financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. 

Opinions 
In our opinion, the basic financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial 
position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Midwest City- 
Del City School District No.1-52, Oklahoma County, Oklahoma as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial 
position for the year in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Other Matters 
Required Supplementary Information 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's discussion and 
analysis on pages 6-11, budgetary comparison information on pages 42 and 43, and Teacher's Retirement Schedules on pages 
40 and 41 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial 
statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial

reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have 
applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally 
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the method of preparing the 
information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial 
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion 
or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to 
express an opinion or provide any assurance. 

Other Information 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose offorming an opinion on the financial statements that collectively comprise the School 
District's basic financial statements. The introductory section, combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements 
and statistical section listed in the accompanying table of contents are presented for purpose of additional analysis, and are not 
a required part of the basic financial statements. The schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of 
additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code 0/ Federal regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements/or Federal Awards, and is also not a required part ofthe basic financial 
statements. 

The combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the 
responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to 
prepare the financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our 
opinion, the combining and individual nonmajor fund financial statements and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards 
are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole. 

The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic 
financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report dated November 26, 2018, on our 
consideration of the School District's internal control over financial reporting and our tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions oflaws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to describe the 
scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide 
an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed 
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School District's internal control over financial reporting 
and compliance.

Management's Discussion & Analysis 



MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

MIDWEST CITY - DEL CITY INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-52 

June 30, 2018 

This section of Midwest City-Del City Independent School District #52's annual financial report presents 
the District's discussion and analysis of the District's financial performance during the fiscal year ended 
June 30, 2018. Please read it in conjunction with the District's financial statements, which immediately 
follow this section. 

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

This annual report consists of three parts - Management's Discussion and Analysis (this section), the basic 
financial statements, and supplementary information. The basic financial statements include two kinds of 
statements that present different views of the District: 

• The first two statements' are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and long- 
term information about the District's overall financial status. 

• The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District, 
reporting the District's operation in more detail than the district-wide statements. 

• The governmental funds statements tell how basic services like regular and special education were 
financed in the short term as well as what remains for future spending. 

The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and 
provide more detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary 
information that further explains and supports the financial statements with a comparison of the District's 
budget for the year.

overview section of management's discussion and analysis highlights the structure and contents of each of 
the statements. 

-6- 



District-Wide Statements: The district-wide statements report information about the District as a whole 
using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement of net position 
includes all of the district's assets and liabilities. All of the current year's revenues and expenses are 
accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid. 

The two district-wide statements report the District's net position. Net position - the difference between the 
District's assets and liabilities is one way to measure the District's financial health or position. 

• Over time, increases or decreases in the District's net position are an indicator of whether its financial 
position is improving or deteriorating, respectively. 

• To assess the overall health of the District, you need to consider additional non-financial factors such 
as changes in the District's property tax base and the condition of school buildings and other facilities. 

In the district wide financial statements, the District's activities are categorized as governmental activities. 

• Governmental Activities - Most of the District's basic services are included here, such as regular and 
special education, transportation, and administration. Property taxes and state aid formula finance 
most of these activities. 

Fund Financial Statements: The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the 
District's funds, focusing on its most significant or "major" funds not the District as a whole. Funds are 
accounting devices the District uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular 
programs: 

• Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants. 

• The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like repaying 
its long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues. 

Most of the District's basic services are included in governmental funds, which generally focus on 1) how 
cash and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash flow in and out; and 2) the balances 
left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide 
a detailed short-term view that helps you determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources 
that can be spent in the near future to finance the District's programs. Because this information does not 
encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-wide statements, the District provides additional 
information with the governmental funds statements that explain the relationship (or differences) between 
them.

CHANGE IN NET POSITION 

-8- 



Changes in Net Position: Changes in Net Position: The ending net position decreased by approximately 
$2.3 million from the prior fiscal year. The District saw an increase in State Aid revenue over the prior 
year of about $310,629, flexible benefit allowance increased by $668,664 for all funds, state pension 
contribution increased by $76,895 and the regular programs for the Tech Center decreased by ($111,560). 
This made the state aid not restricted for specific programs with an overall increase of $944,628. Motor 
vehicle tax revenue continues to decrease due to our drop in average daily attendance (ADA) by 
$175,480. General Fund expenses increased by $1 million mainly due to step raises. 

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT'S FUNDS 

As the District completed the year, its governmental funds reported combined fund balances of $52.1 
million, compared to $54.4 million in FYI7. 

In analyzing our major funds identified for FY18 as the General Fund, Bond 33, and Debt Service Fund, 
the only significant balances and transactions were in the General Fund by increasing the carryover from 
9.13% to 10.27% which was helped by the healthy carryover from FY 17. The only significant transaction 
from Bond 33 was the lease payment due in FY 18 leaving only 1 more payment due in FY 19 

Significant balances and transactions in Bond Fund 33 had to do with the sale of GO Bonds of$14,140,000 
in FY18 and $10,360,000 in FY19 used to make the lease revenue payment. This process will continue 
through FY 2019. The additional payments were to fulfill the original resolution of Bond 33 and will decline 
as we continue to complete projects as outlined. Bond 35and 39 will be sold each July with $3,100,000 
going to projects that were identified and the remainder being used to make our lease payment in October 
starting in FYI9. 

The only limitations that affect the availability of fund resources for future use would be the carryover of 
federal dollars in the General Fund of $1.32 million which is restricted to the use of only those respective 
federal programs. Bond funds are only restricted in the sense that they must meet the 85% rule of what was 
voted on by the patrons of the District and then used for like purposes. The Building Fund, Child Nutrition 
Fund and Debt Service Fund are restricted only in regards to what is required by law to be used in those 
respected funds. 

General Fund Budgetary Highlights: The General Fund approved budget in FY18 decreased by $1.7 million 
but expenditures increased by $1.6 million from FYI7. The fund balance for the General Fund increased in 
FY18 from 9.13% or $8,014,260 in FY17 to 10.27% or $8,983,942. The increase in fund balance was due 
to increased ad valorem taxes being collected for the other half of the calendar year 2017 with an increase 
of 5.29%., when a local TIF was paid off early. 

CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION 

Capital Assets: By the end of 2018 the District had expended $12.6 million in a broad range of capital 
assets, including new classroom additions and renovations, roof repairs and building renovations, computer 
and technology equipment, security vestibules, security monitors and cameras, fencing, and furniture, 
equipment. 

-9- 



Long-Term Debt: At year end the District had $47.30 million in total long-term GO debt outstanding. This 
is an increase from last year's amount of $44.14 million. (More detailed information about the District's 
long-term liabilities is presented in Note 5 to the financial statements.) 

• The District continued to pay down its debt, retiring $49.8 million of outstanding GO bonds, leases 
payable, pension liability and compensated absences in FYI8. 

• $16.98 million in new GO debt and premium was issued during the year and that with the District's 
rental payment of$3,000 made the District's seventh payment on the 2012 Lease Revenue Bonds. The 
2018 Lease Revenue and premium on bonds were received in February, 2018 totaling $86.9 million 
and were offset with the cash and investments in the Trust account shown as "Other Receivables" on 
the Statement of Net Position. 

FACTORS BEARING ON THE DISTRICT'S FUTURE 

At the time these financial statements were prepared and audited, the District was not aware of any existing 
circumstances that would adversely impact the finances of the district that have not already been presented 
in the audit. 

CONTACTING THE DISTRICT'S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 

This financial report is designated to provide the District's citizens, taxpayers, customers, and investors and

INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-52, OKLAHOMA COUNTY 
RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS BALANCE SHEET 

TO THE STATEMENT OF NET POSITION 
JUNE 30, 2018 

Total governmental fund balances 

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement 
of net position are different because: 

Capital assets used in governmental activities are not financial 
resources and; therefore, are not reported as assets 
in governmental funds. 

Revenues receivable are not available soon enough to pay 
for the current period's expenditures and, therefore, are deferred 
in the funds. 
Property taxes 

An internal service fund is used by the District to charge the costs 
of workers' compensation insurance to the individual funds. 
The assets and liabilities of the internal service fund are included 
with governmental activities. 

Pension related deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources are not due and payable in the current year and, therefore, 
are not reported in the governmental funds, as follows: 
Deferred outflows of resources 
Deferred inflows of resources 

Long-term liabilities, including bonds payable, are not due and 
payable in the current period and; therefore, are not reported 
as liabilities in the funds. Long-term liabilities at year-end consist of: 
Bonds 
Premium on bonds 
Leases payable 
Accrued interest 
Compensated absences 
Bond proceeds good faith deposit 
Net pension liability 

Funds available for drawdown under the capital lease are reported 
as a receivable in the governmental activities, but not reported 
in governmental funds.

Because some revenues will not be collected for several months after the District's

JUNE 30, 2018 

Net change in fund balance - total governmental funds $ (2,325,616) 

Amounts reported for governmental activities and the statement 
of activities are different because: 

Capital outlays to purchase or build capital assets are reported in 
governmental funds as expenditures. However, for governmental activities, those 
costs are shown in the statement of net position and allocated over their estimated 
useful lives as annual depreciation expense in the statement of activities. This is the 
amount by which the capital outlays exceeded depreciation and retirements 
in the period. 

Capital outlays 
Depreciation expense 
Loss on disposal of capital assets

Drawdowns of capital lease funds of $2,393,468 used for the purchase of capital assets, 
net of dividends earned of $365,313 (2,028,155) 

Some of the capital assets acquired this year were financed with general obligation bonds. 
The amount financed by the bonds and related premium is reported in tile governmental 
funds as a source of financing, but increases long-term liabilities in the statement 
of net position and does not affect the statement of activities. 

An internal service fund is used by the District to charge the costs of workers 
compensation insurance to the individual funds. The changes in net position of 
the internal service fund is reported with governmental activities. (155,431 ) 

(17,658,949) 

Repayment of bond principal and repayment on capital lease purchases are an expense 
in the governmental funds, but it reduces long-term liabilities in the statement 
of net position and does not affect the statement of activities. Amortization of bond 
premium is recorded in the statement of activities, but not in the governmental funds. 26,805,817 

In the statement of activities, certain expenses do not require the use of current 
financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as expenditures in govemmental funds. 
Compensated absences 
Pension expense, less state contributions 

9,114 
(7,703,366) 

Interest on long-term debt in the statement of activities differs from the amount reported 
in the governmental funds because interest is recorded as an expenditure 
in the funds when it is due, and thus, requires the use of current financial 
resources. In the statement of activities, interest expense is recognized 
as the interest accrues, regardless of when it is due. (1,032,581 )

INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-52, OKLAHOMA COUNTY 
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The financial statements of the Midwest City-Del City Public Schools Independent District 
No. 52 (the "District") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") as applied to government units 
as promulgated by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board ("GASB"), the standard- 
setting body for governmental accounting and financial reporting principles. The more 
significant of the District's accounting policies are described below. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and, accordingly, is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. 
The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and 
control ofthe State Board of Education and is financially dependent on the State of Oklahoma 
for support. The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma 
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The governing body of the District 
is the Board of Education composed of five elected members. The appointed superintendent 
is the executive officer of the District. 

As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the 
basic financial statements present the reporting entity which consists of the primary 
government; organizations for which the primary government is financially accountable and 
other organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship with the 
primary government are such that exclusion could cause the District's basic financial 
statements to be misleading. 

The District has presented the entities which comprise the reporting entity in the basic 
financial statements for 2018. 

The Midwest City-Del City Lewis Eubanks Technical Center (formerly the Mid-Del Area 
Vo-Tech) became a designated Area Vocational-Technical School in 1977 by action of the 
Oklahoma State Board of Vocational and Technical Education with no ad valorem millage 
devoted specifically for its support. It is the only designated technology center in the State 
of Oklahoma that shares a school board with a public school district. The Mid-Del School 
District No. I-52 board of education serves as the Tech Center's board of education. The 
Technical Center is reported as a blended component unit as a special revenue fund of the 
primary government.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

I. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 
A. Reporting Entity - contd. 

The government-wide financial statements (the statement of net position and the statement 
of activity) report information on all of the non-fiduciary activities of the school district. For 
the most part, the effect of inter-fund activity has been removed from these statements. 

B. Fund Accounting 

Governmental activities are normally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues 
and are reported separately from business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent 
on fees and charges for support. All ofthe District's activities are reported as governmental 
activities. 

The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct expenses of a given 
function or segment is offset by program revenues. Direct expenses are those that are clearly 
identifiable with a specific function. Indirect expenses of other functions are not allocated 
to those functions but are reported separately in the statement of activities. Program revenues 
include I) tuition or fees paid by students or citizens of the District and 2) grants and 
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a 
particular function. Taxes and other items, including state aid, that are not properly included 
among program revenues are reported as general revenues. 

The school district segregates transactions related to certain functions or activities in separate 
funds in order to aid financial management and to demonstrate legal compliance. 

Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, proprietary, and fiduciary 
funds, even though the latter are excluded from the government-side financial statements. 

Governmental Fund Types 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general capital assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing 
of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those 
required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local 
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 
B. Fund Accounting - contd. 

Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for 
programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service 
on bonds and other long-term debt. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds are the District's building, co-op and child 
nutrition funds. 

Building Fund - The building fund consists of monies derived property taxes levied for 
the purpose of erecting, remodeling, repairing, or maintaining school buildings and for 
purchasing furniture and equipment. 

Co-op Fund - The co-op fund is established when the boards of education of two or 
more school districts enter into cooperative agreements and maintain joint programs. 
The revenues necessary to operate a cooperative program can come from federal, state, 
or local sources, including the individual contributions of participating school districts. 
The expenditures for this fund would consist of those necessary to operate and maintain 
the joint programs. The District did not maintain this fund during the 2017-18 fiscal 
year. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The child nutrition fund is a special revenue fund used to 
account for the operations of the child nutrition programs. Revenue sources include 
meal ticket sales and Federal and State grants for free and reduced meals. 

Technology Center Fund - The technology center fund is used to account for financial 
resources to be used for the operation of vocational and technical education programs. 

Debt Service Fund - The debt service (sinking fund) is used to account for the accumulation 
of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal, interest, and 
related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for 
debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 

Bond 33 Fund - The bond fund is a capital project fund used to account for the proceeds of 
bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new 
school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 
B. Fund Accounting - contd. 

Tech Center Building Fund - The tech center building fund is used to account for financial 
resources restricted to the Technology Center's remodeling or repairing buildings and 
purchasing furniture and equipment. 

Bond 32,34,35,38, and 39 Funds - The bond funds are used to account for the proceeds of 
bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new 
school 
facilities, removing existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment. 

Casualty/Insurance Funds - The insurance fund was established to account for revenues and 
expenditures for all types of insurance coverage and major reimbursements and reserves for 
property. 

Proprietary Fund Types 

Proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in the private sector, 
where the determination of net income is necessary or useful to sound financial 
administration. Goods or services from such activities can be provided either to outside 
parties (enterprise funds) or to other departments or agencies primarily within the District 
(internal service funds). Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from 
non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing 
services in connection with a proprietary fund's principal ongoing operations. Operating 
expenses for enterprise funds and internal service funds include the cost of sales and services, 
administrative expenses and depreciation on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not 
meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues and expenses. The District 
reports the following non-major propriety fund: 

Internal Service Fund - Worker's Compensation - The workers' compensation insurance 
fund is an internal service fund used to account for the accumulation, recording and 
disbursing of District contributions to the District's self-insured Workers' Compensation 
Account. 

Fiduciary Fund Types 
Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including 
other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are 
held under the terms of a formula trust agreement, either a private purpose trust fund or a 
permanent fund is used. The terms "permanent" and "private purpose" refer to whether or

not the District is under an obligation to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally 
are used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do 
not involve measurement of results of operations. 

The District reports the following non-major fiduciary funds: 

Private Purpose Trust Funds - Gifts Fund - The gifts fund is a private-purpose trust fund to 
account for donations received for the benefit of specified individuals associated with the 
District. This fund was not active during the current fiscal year. 

Agency Fund - Activity Fund - The activity fund is used to account for monies collected 
principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District sponsored groups. The 
administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursing, and 
accounting for these activity funds. 

The District's fiduciary funds have been excluded from the government-wide financial 
statements. 

Account Group 
Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to 
establish accounting control over long-term debt and fixed assets. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account 
for all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt 
service fund and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt 
principal. It is also used to account for other liabilities (judgments and lease purchases), 
which are to be paid from funds provided in future years. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Measurement Focus 

The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources 
measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as are the proprietary fund and 
fiduciary fund financial statements. The economic resources measurement focus is not 
applicable to the agency fund and therefore they have no measurement focus. Revenues are 
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of 
the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for 
which they are levied.

NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - contd. 
C. Basis of Accounting and Measurement Focus - contd. 

Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements 
imposed by the provider have been met. 

Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current financial resources 
measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized 
as soon as they are both measurable and available. Revenues are considered to be available 
when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities 
of the current period. For this purpose, the government considers revenues to be available if 
they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures 
generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, 
debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and 
pension liabilities are recorded only when the payment is due. 

Property taxes and interest and certain state and federal grants associated with the current 
fiscal period are all considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as 
revenues of the current fiscal period. All other revenue items are considered to be measurable 
and available only when cash is received by the government. 

D. Budget and Budgetary Accounting 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the general fund, building fund, 
debt service (sinking) fund, child nutrition fund, tech center, and tech center building fund 
that included revenues and expenditures. These budgets are prepared on a modified cash 
basis of accounting. Budgetary control is maintained by fund, function, and activity and 
budgeted expenditures may not exceed appropriations at the fund level. Amendments may 
be made to the budget without approval by the governing body at the function and activity 
levels. Fund level budgetary amendments require approval of the governing body. 

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or 
services. Encumbrance accounting under which purchase orders, contracts and other 
commitments for the expenditure of resources are recorded to reserve a portion of the 
applicable fund balance is utilized in all governmental funds of the District. Appropriations 
which are not spent lapse at the end of the fiscal year and encumbrances are reversed. On 
the first day of the following fiscal year, the encumbrances are reinstated and the 
expenditures are applied against the year's budget. At the beginning of the next year, prior 
year encumbrances are reviewed and some are reestablished. There were no material 
encumbrances which lapsed at June 30, 2017 and were reinstated during fiscal year 2018.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- contd. 
E. Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows/Outflows and Fund Balance/Net Position 

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Investments - The District considers all cash on hand, 
demand deposits interest bearing checking accounts, and highly liquid investments with an 
original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. 
As of June 30, 2018, all ofthe District's investments were in money market accounts which 
meet the definition of cash equivalents. Investments, not meeting the definition of cash 
equivalents, are recorded at fair value. 

Inventories - Inventories in the governmental funds are recorded as expenditures when 
purchased rather than when consumed. Inventories include fuel, maintenance supplies, 
instructional supplies, and food service supplies. Cost of donated federal surplus 
commodities is based on values established by the federal government at the time of 
donation. 

Capital Assets - Capital assets, which include property, plant and equipment, are reported in 
the government-wide financial statements. 

The capitalization threshold is $5,000. All purchased capital assets are valued at cost when 
historical records exist and at an estimated historical cost where no historical records exist. 
Donated capital assets are valued at their fair market value on the date donated. 

The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the assets or 
materially extend asset lives are not capitalized. Improvements are capitalized and 
depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related capital assets, as applicable. 

Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the following useful lives:

E. Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows/Outflows and Fund Balance/Net Position - contd. 

Deferred Outflows of Resources - In addition to assets, the statement of net position will 
sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate 
financial statement element represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future 
period(s). It will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until 
then. Deferred outflows of resources for the year ended June 30, 2018 consist of 
unrecognized items not yet charged to pension expense and contributions from the District 
after the measurement date but before the end of the District's reporting period. 

Deferred Inflows of Resources - In addition to liabilities, financial statements will sometimes 
report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement 
element represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s). It will not 
be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until then. The governmental fund balance 
sheet includes deferred inflows of resources related to unavailable revenue from property 
taxes, federal revenue, and local revenue. These amounts are deferred and recognized as an 
inflow of resources in the period that the amounts become available. 

Deferred inflows of resources in the statement of net position for the year ended June 30, 
2018 consist of succeeding year property tax receivables that will not be recognized until the 
year for which it is levied and budgeted for and the unamortized portion of the net difference 
between projected and actual earnings on pension plan investments and pension plan 
expenence. 

Compensated Absences - The District's policy allows employees to accumulate unused sick 
leave from year to year as long as employees remain continuously in the Midwest City-Del 
City School system. Maximum number of days that can be accumulated for purposes of sick 
leave cannot exceed one hundred twenty (120) days at the beginning of the school year. For 
the purposes of sick leave reimbursement upon retirement or resignation, the district pays for 
all sick leave accrued during employment not previously paid for by the Midwest City-Del 
City School District. 

A twelve-month salaried employee is eligible for twelve (12) days paid vacation each year 
accrued at the rate of one (1) day per month. Twelve month employees may carryover 
vacation days up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) days. Upon retirement or resignation, 
the District will reimburse an employee for accrued vacation at the employee's regular daily 
rate of pay.

Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows/Outflows and Fund Balance/Net Position - contd. 

Compensated Absences - contd. 
The liability for compensated absences attributable to the District's governmental funds is 
recorded in the government-wide financial statements. A liability for those amounts is 
recorded in governmental funds only if the liability has matured as a result of employee 
resignations or retirements. 

Long-term Liabilities - In the government-wide financial statements and proprietary fund 
types in the fund financial statements, long-term debt and other long-term obligations are 
reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental activities statement of net position. 
Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the life of the bonds using 
the straight-ling method which approximates the effective interest method. Bond issuance 
costs are expensed when incurred. 

In the governmental fund financial statements, the face amount of debt is reported as other 
financing sources. Repayments of long-term debt are reported as expenditures. Premiums 
received on debt issuances are reported as other financing sources, while discounts on debt 
issuances are reported as other financing uses. Issuance costs, whether or not withheld from 
the actual debt proceeds received, are reported as debt service expenditures. 

Pensions - For purposed of measuring the net pension asset (liability), deferred outflows of 
resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, 
information about the fiduciary net position of Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System 
(OTRS) and additions to/deductions from these fiduciary net positions has been determined 
on the same basis as they are reported by OTRS. For this purpose, benefit payments 
(including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in 
accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. 

Net Position - The government-wide, proprietary fund, and fiduciary fund financial 
statements utilize a net position presentation. Net position is categorized as net investment 
in capital assets, restricted, and unrestricted. 

Net Investment in Capital Assets - This component of net position reports capital assets less 
both accumulated depreciation and the outstanding balance of debt (excluding unexpended 
proceeds) that is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of 
those assets. Any deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources that are 
attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets or related debt 
are also included in the component of net position.

E. Assets, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows/Outflows and Fund Balance/Net Position - contd. 

Restricted Net Position - This component of net position reports the difference between 
assets, deferred inflows/outflows of resources and liabilities of certain programs or funds that 
consist of assets with constraints placed on their use by either external parties and/or enabling 
legislation. Net position restricted by enabling legislation consists of $15,256,982 for debt 
service and $11,709,661 for buildings. 

Umestricted Net Position - Net position that does not meet the definition of net investment 
in capital assets or restricted are classified as unrestricted. 

It is the District's policy to first use restricted net position prior to the use of unrestricted net 
position when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted 
net position are available. 

Fund Balance - Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance. Fund balance 
consists of five categories, defines as follows: 

Nonspendable Fund Balance - The nonspendable fund balance classification includes 
amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) 
legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. This would include items 
not expected to be converted to cash including inventories, long-term receivables, and 
prepaid amounts. It may also include long-term loans and receivables, as well as 
property acquired for resale and the corpus (principal) of a permanent fund. 

Restricted Fund Balance - The restricted fund balance classification should be reported 
when constraints placed on the use of resources are either (a) externally imposed by 
creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments or (b) 
imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 

Committed Fund Balance - The committed fund balance classification reflects specific 
purposes pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the District's highest level 
of decision-making authority (the District's Board of Education). Such constraints can 
only be removed or changed by the same form of formal action. Funds set aside by the 
Board of Education as committed fund balance requires the approval of a resolution by 
a majority vote of the members of the Board of Education. Such approval must take 
place prior to the District's fiscal year-end in order for it to be applicable to that fiscal 
year. It is permitted for the specific amount of the commitment to be determined after

the fiscal year-end if any additional information is required in order to determine the 
exact amount. The Board of Education has the authority to remove or change the 
commitment of funds with a resolution. 

Assigned Fund Balance - The assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts 
that are constrained by the government's intent to be used for specific purposes but 
meet neither the restricted nor committed forms of constraint. Assigned funds cannot 
cause a deficit in unassigned fund balance. For the purposes of assigned fund balance, 
the District has given authority to the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent of 
Fiscal Services to assign funds for specific purposes. 

Unassigned Fund Balance - The unassigned fund balance classification is the residual 
classification for the General Fund only. It is also where negative residual amounts for 
all other governmental funds must be reported. Unassigned fund balance essentially 
consists of excess funds that have not been classified in the other four fund balance 
categories mentioned above. 

It is the District's policy to use restricted fund balance prior to the use of unrestricted fund 
balance when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted 
fund balances are available. The District's policy for the use of unrestricted fund balance 
amounts requires that committed amounts would be used first, followed by assigned and then 
unassigned amounts when expenditures are incurred for purposes for which amounts in any 
of those unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used. 

F. Revenue and Expenditures 

Property Tax Revenue and Receivables -The District is authorized by state law to levy 
property taxes, which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the 
District. Property tax is levied each October 1 on the assessed valuation of real and personal 
property within the District as of the preceding January 1, the lien date. The County 
Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends 
the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1. The 
county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. 
The first half of taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1.

Property Tax Revenue and Receivables - contd. 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 
2. The second half of the tax become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of 
assessment. If taxes are delinquent and unpaid for a period of three (3) years or more, the 
real estate may be sold for taxes. 

Uncollected taxes assessed on valuations made each year are recorded in the District's 
financial statements. The delinquent taxes which are not collected within 60 days of year- 
end are recorded in the financial statements as deferred inflows of resources. Uncollectible 
personal and real property taxes are deemed to be immaterial because the property can be 
sold for the amount of taxes due. 

The District also enters into agreements each year between the Board of Education for the 
Midwest City-Del City Lewis Eubanks Technical Center and the Board of Trustees for the 
Rose State College Technical Area Education District. Under these agreements, the Mid- 
Del School District receives 50 percent of total collections for the fiscal year. 

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed 
by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts 
based on information accumulated from the Districts. 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department 
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors 
disclosed by review. Normally such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of 
revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs 
be expended only for the program which the money is provided and require that the money 
not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to 
be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department of Education requires 
that categorical education program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 

Inter-fund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, 
expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund for 
expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are

recorded as expenditures/expenses in the reimbursing fund and as reductions of

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

New/adopted pronouncements 
The GASB has issued several new accounting pronouncements, which will be effective to 
the District in both the reported and subsequent years. A description of the new accounting 
pronouncements, the fiscal year in which they are effective, and the District's consideration 
of the impact of these pronouncements are described below: 

New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted as of June 30, 2018 

• GASB Statement No. 74, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than 
Pension Plans. GASB No. 74 was issued in June 2015 and will be effective for the District 
beginning with its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The Statement replaces GASB 
Statement No. 43, Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than 
Pension Plans, and addresses the financial reports of defined benefit OPEB plans that are 
administered through trusts that meet specified criteria. The Statement follows the 
framework for financial reporting of defined benefit OPEB plans in Statement No. 45 by 
requiring a statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net 
position but requires more extensive note disclosures and Required Supplementary 
Information related to the measurement of the OPEB liabilities for which assets have been 
accumulated, including information about the annual money-weighted rates of return on 
plan investments. The Statement also sets forth note disclosure requirements for defined 
contribution OPEB plans. The District does not currently participate or sponsor 
postemployment benefits plans other than pensions held in trusts . 

• GASB Statement No. 75, Accounting and Financial Reporting/or Postemployment Benefits 
Other Than Pensions, issued in June 2015, will be effective for the District beginning with 
its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The Statement replaces the requirements of GASB 
Statement No. 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers/or Postemployment 
Benefits Other Than Pensions and requires governments to report a liability on the face of 
the financial statements for the OPEB they provide and outlines the reporting requirements

by governments for defined benefit OPEB plans administered through a trust. The 
Statement also requires governments to present more extensive note disclosures and 
required supplementary information about their OPEB liabilities. Some governments 
are legally responsible to make contributions directly to an OPEB plan or make benefit 
payments directly as OPEB comes due for employees of other governments. In certain 
circumstances, called special funding situations, the Statement requires these 
governments to recognize in their financial statements a share of the other 
government's net OPEB liability. The District does not currently participate or sponsor 
postemployment benefits plans other than pensions held in trusts. 

• GASB issued Statement No. 81, Irrevocable Split-Interest Agreements. This Statement 
requires that a government that receives resources pursuant to an irrevocable split- 
interest agreement recognize assets, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources at the 
inception of the agreement. The requirements of this Statement are effective for periods 
beginning after December 15, 2016. The District does not currently receive resources 
pursuant to an irrevocable split-interest agreement. The District will continue to 
evaluate the impact this new standard may have on future financial statements. 

• GASB issued Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations. Statement No. 
83 requires the measurement and recognition of a legally enforceable liability for 
retirement of an asset. Also requires the measurement of an Asset Retirement 
Obligation CARO) be based on the best estimate of the current value of outlays to be 
incurred. This estimate should include the probability weighting of all potential 
outcomes, when the information is available or can be obtained at a reasonable cost. 
The Statement pertains to certain kinds of assets, i.e., sewage treatment plants, 
magnetic resonance imaging machines, research facilities owned by public universities 
like nuclear research reactors, and retirement of x -ray machines. These kinds of assets 
may have to be disposed in a certain way due to regulations. The effective date of the 
Statement is for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2018. Earlier application is 
encouraged. The District currently does not have any asset retirement obligations which 
fit the criteria for this Statement. The District will continue to evaluate this Statement 
for future disclosure requirements.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

• GASB issued Statement No. 84, Fiduciary Activities. Statement No. 84 improves 
guidance regarding the identification of fiduciary activities for accounting and financial 
reporting purposes and how those activities should be reported. The Statement 
addresses the categorization of fiduciary activities for financial reporting, how 
fiduciary activities are to be reported, and when liabilities to beneficiaries must be 
disclosed. The requirements for the Statement are effective for reporting periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018. Earlier application is encouraged. The District 
currently has fiduciary activities and will evaluate the fiduciary activities that meet the 
criteria state in Statement No. 84 and prepare disclosures under fiduciary funds in basic 
financial statements. The District will report agency funds as custodial funds as 
specified in the Statement. In addition, the District will continue to evaluate the effects 
of this Statement on future financial reporting. 

• GASB issued Statement No. 85, Omnibus 2017. The object of Statement No. 85 is to 
address practice issues that have been identified during implementation and application 
of certain GASB Statements. The topics are related to blending component units, 
goodwill, fair value measurement and application, and postemployment benefits 
(pension and other postemployment benefits (OPEB)). The ten topics addressed in the 
Statement are as follows, 1) Blending a component unit in circumstances in which the 
primary government is a business-type activity that reports in a single column for 
financial statement presentation, 2) Reporting amounts previously reported as goodwill 
and "negative" goodwill, 3) Classifying real estate held by insurance entities, 4) 
Measuring certain money market investments and participating interest earning 
investment contracts at amortized cost,S) Timing of the measurement of pension or 
OPEB liabilities and expenditures recognized in financial statements prepared. Using 
the current financial resources measurement focus, 6) Recognizing on-behalf payments 
for pensions or OPEB in employer financial statements, 7) Presenting payroll-related 
measures in required supplementary information for purposes of reporting by OPEB 
plans and employers that provide OPEB, 8) Classifying employer-paid member 
contributions for OPEB, 9) Simplifying certain aspects of the alternative measurement 
method for OPEB, and 10) Accounting and financial reporting for OPEB provided 
through certain multiple-employer defined benefit OPEB plans. The requirements of 
this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15,2017. Earlier 
application is encouraged. The District will continue to evaluate the effects of this

Statement on future financial reporting. 

• GASB issued Statement No. 86, Certain Debt Extinguishment Issues. The object of 
Statement No. 86 is to improve consistency in accounting and financial reporting for 
in-substance defeasance of debt by providing guidance for transactions in which cash 
and other monetary assets acquired with only existing resources. The Statement also 
improves accounting and financial reporting for prepaid insurance on debt that is 
extinguished and notes to financial statements for debt that is defeased in substance. 
Criteria for determining an in-substance defeasance is that the trust hold only monetary 
assets that are essentially risk-free. If substitution of essentially risk-free monetary 
assets that are not essentially risk-free is not prohibited, governments should disclose 
the fact in the period in which the debt is defeased in substance. The requirements of 
this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2017. The 
District does not currently have in-substance defeasance transactions nor do we have 
prepaid insurance related to debt that has been extinguished. The District will continue 
to evaluate the effects of this Statement on future financial reporting. 

• GASB issued Statement No. 87, Leases. The object of Statement No. 87 is to better 
meet the information needs of financial statement users by improving accounting and 
financial reporting for leases by governments. This Statement increases the usefulness 
of governments' financial statements by requiring recognition of certain lease assets 
and liabilities for leases that previously were classified as operating leases and 
recognized as inflows of resources or outflows of resources based on the payment 
provisions of the contract. It establishes a single model for lease accounting based on 
the foundational principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying 
asset. Under this Statement, a lessee is required to recognize a lease liability and an 
intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is required to recognize a lease 
receivable and a deferred inflow of resources, thereby enhancing the relevance and 
consistency of information about governments' leasing activities. The requirements of 
this Statement are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,2019. 
Although the District has been party to lease contracts in the past the District does not 
currently nor plan to enter into lease contracts or lease agreements in the future. Should 
this management decision change, the District will evaluate and report the leases 
accurately according to the Statement.

issues have been approved by the voters and issued by the District for various capital 
improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the 
date of issue. 

General long-term debt of the District consists of bond payable, and obligations for 
compensated absences. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund 
balance and future revenues of the debt service fund.

 Capital Leases: 
 

In February 2018, the school district entered into a Ground Lease Agreement with the 
Oklahoma County Finance Authority (the “Authority”) under which the district is leasing 
certain land upon which the Authority will construct improvements from the proceeds of 
$77,060,000 in revenue bonds sold for that purpose. Improvements are to be constructed for 
so long as there are obligations outstanding, which are secured by the Ground Lease 
Agreement. The improvements to be constructed by the Authority consist of stadium 
renovations to Carl Albert Harris, Del City Kalsu, and Midwest City Darnell Stadiums, 
improvements to Kerr Middle School, Carl Albert Middle School, Monroney Middle School 
and Schwartz Elementary, Del City and Midwest City High School Performing Arts Centers 
renovations and various reoccurring District-wide projects. These facilities will be leased by 
the Authority to the school district pursuant to a sublease agreement enter into as of February 
1, 2018. The sublease agreement between the Authority and the Mid-Del School District 
enables the district to lease back the property leased in the ground lease, and utilized the 
proceeds of the revenue bonds (issued by the Authority) for the construction and 
improvements on the property. The sublease agreement also provides a mechanism for the 
district to obtain title to the improvements free and clear of security interest. The District 
intends to finance the sublease agreements lease payments through a periodic issuance of 
Building Bonds which were authorized and approved by school district voters at an election 
held on October 10, 2017. These bonds are scheduled to be issued on dates, and in amounts, 
which coincide with sublease rental payments.

Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System 

Plan Description: 

The District participates in the OTRS, a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee 
retirement system that is self-administered. OTRS provides retirement, disability, and death 
benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Benefit provisions are established and may be 
amended by the legislature of the State of Oklahoma. Title 70 of the Oklahoma State Statues 
assigns the authority for management and operation ofOTRS to the Board of Trustees of the 
System. OTRS issues a publicly available annual financial report that can be obtained at 
www.ok.gov/TRS. 

Benefits Provided: 

OTRS provides defined retirement benefits based on members' final compensation, age, and 
term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for benefits upon disability and 
to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O. S. Sec. 17-105 defines all 
retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit provisions rests with the 
State Legislature. 

Benefit Provisions Include: 

o Members become 100% vested in retirement benefits earned to date after five years 
of credited Oklahoma service. Member who joined OTRS on June 30, 1992 or prior 
are eligible to retire at maximum benefits when age and years of creditable service 
total 80. Members joining ORTS after June 30, 1992 are eligible for maximum 
benefits when their age and year of creditable service total 90. Members whose age 
and service do not equal the eligible limit may receive reduced benefits as early as 
age 55, and at the age 62 receive unreduced benefits based on their years of service. 
The maximum retirement benefit is equal to 2 percent of final compensation for 
year of credited service. 

o Final compensation for members who joined OTRS prior to July 1, 1992 is defined 
as the average salary for the three highest years of compensation. Final 
compensation for members joining OTRS after June 30, 1992 is defined as the 
average of the five consecutive years of annual compensation in which 
contributions have been made. The final average compensation is limited for 
service credit accumulated prior to July 1, 1995 to $40,000 or $25,000, depending

percent of their annual compensation. The District paid the employees' required contribution. 
The amount paid by the District for employees totaled approximately $3.9 million for the 
year ended June 30, 2018. The District's contribution rate is 9.5 percent for the year ended 
June 30, 2018. In addition, the District is required to match the State's contribution rate on 
salaries that are paid with federal funds. The District's contributions to OTRS in 2018 were 
$6.3 million, equal to the annual required contributions each year. The District's matching 
contributions to OTRS in 2018 were $0.5 million. 

The State makes a contribution on behalf of each teacher meeting mnumum salary 
requirements (known as the OTRS years of services credit). The credit amount is determined 
based on years of services and ranges from $60.15 per year for 0 years of service to $1,410.53

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred 
Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions: 

At June 30, 2018, the District reported a liability of$115,630,011 for its proportionate share 
of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017 and 
the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an 
actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2017. The District's proportion of the net pension liability 
was based on the District's contributions to OTRS relative to total contributions of OTRS 
for all participating employees for the year ended June 30, 2017. Based upon this 
information, the District's proportion was 1.74632969 percent. 

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the District recognized pension expense of $13.0 million. 
June 30, 2018, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of 
resources related to pensions from the following sources:

Deferred pension outflows totaling $6.8 million resulting from the District's contributions 
subsequent to the measurement date, will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension 
liability in the subsequent fiscal year. The net deferred pension inflows totaling $14.9 million 
resulting from the difference between expected and actual experience of $7.9 million, 
changes in assumptions of $6.9 million and $.1 million in the proportional changes and 
differences between District contributions and proportional share of contributions. The 
deferred outflows totaling $13.7 million resulting from changes in assumptions, and deferred 
outflows of $1.6 million resulting from the net difference between projected and actual 
investment earnings on pension plan investments will be recognized in pension expense 
using the average expected remaining life of the plan. The average expected remaining life 
of the Plan is determined by taking the calculated total future service years of the Plan divided 
by the number of people in the Plan including retirees. The total future service years of the 
Plan are estimated at 5.59 years at June 30, 2017 and are determined using the mortality, 
termination, retirement and disability assumptions associated with the Plan. 

Deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources will be recognized in 
pension expense as follows:

• Investment Rate of Return-7.50 percent, net of expenses and compounded annually 
• Retirement Age-Experience-based table of rates based on age, service, and gender. 

Adopted by the Board in May 2015 in conjunction with the five-year experience study 
for the period ending June 2014 

• Payroll Growth Rate-2.75 percent per year. This increase rate has no allowance for 
future membership growth 

The actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2017 valuation were based on the results of 
an actuarial experience study, dated May 13,2015, for the period July 1, 2009-June 30, 2014 
and in conjunction with the five-year-experience study for the period ending June 30, 2014. 

Based on the stated assumptions and the projection of cash flows, the pension plan's 
fiduciary net position and future contributions were projected to be available to finance all 
projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term 
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected 
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a 
building block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return 
(expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are develop for each 
major asset class. The ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return 
by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage 
and by adding expected inflation.

INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-52, OKLAHOMA COUNTY 
NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

11. OCMAPS Program 

The School District participates in a program administered through the Oklahoma City 
Metropolitan Area Public Schools Trust, whereby the Trust reviews and approves project 
applications from Oklahoma City and suburban school districts that educate Oklahoma City 
resident students for improvements to school facilities utilized by Oklahoma City students. 
The OCMP AS program is funded through a temporary Oklahoma City sales tax which began 
on January 1,2002, and ended December 31, 2008. The Trust budgets sales tax collections 
for Oklahoma City Public Schools and 23 suburban school districts and reviews and approves 
applications for facilities improvement, from the 23 suburban school districts that educate 
Oklahoma City resident students. The Trust maintains budget allocations for each 
participating school district and notifies each district quarterly of funds remaining for 
applications for the school. At June 30, 2018, the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area Public 
Schools Trust maintained an account balance of $0 for Mid-Del Public Schools applications 
for program funding. Revenues and expenditures for this program are reported by the Mid- 
Del School District through a special revenue fund entitled MAPS fund. 

12. Interfund Loan Agreement 

The District approved a loan agreement between the child nutrition services and the general 
fund for the purpose of allowing adequate cash flow within the child nutrition fund until such 
time during the fiscal year the child nutrition fund receives reimbursements from state, 
federal, and lunch collections sufficient to meet cash flow needs. The loan agreement 
provides that the District's general fund furnish the District's child nutrition fund the cost of 
an amount not to exceed $402,041 as a contingent liability subject to repayment as funds 
become available from the child nutrition fund. This loan agreement included items such as 
utilities, insurance, maintenance and lease agreements, copier and postage expense, audit 
expense, technology support, transportation expense, and the coverage of end-of-year 
shortfalls (i.e., salaries, inventory, etc.). The loan was repaid during the fiscal year and no 
outstanding amounts have been reported in the financial statements at June 30, 2018. 

13. Subsequent Events 

Management has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the audit report, which is 
the date the financial statements were available to be issued and have determined that no 
additional information needs to be added to the financial statements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Midwest City-Del City School District 
Midwest City, OK 73110 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Midwest City- 
Del City School District No. I-52, Midwest City, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 218, 
and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the School District's 
basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated November 26, 2018. This report 
was unqualified with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the School District's 
internal control over financial reporting to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District's internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School District's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course ofperforming their assigned functions, to prevent or 
detect misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement 
of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. 
A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less 
severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant 
deficiencies or material weaknesses. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

WWW.JENKINSKEMPER.COM 



Compliance and Other Matters 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School District's financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and 
material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion 
on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not 
express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other 
matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

Purpose of this Report 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in 
accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and 
compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH 
MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE 

REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

The Honorable Board of Education 
Midwest City-Del City School District No. I-52 
Midwest City, Oklahoma 73110 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited the compliance of Midwest City-Del City School District No. I-52, Midwest City, 
Oklahoma, with the types of compliance requirements described in the US. Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major 
federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in 
the summary of auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (The Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance 
with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, Midwest City-Del City District No. I-52, Midwest City, Oklahoma complied, in all material 
respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
The management of Midwest City-Del City District No. I-52, Midwest City, Oklahoma is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit, we considered the District's internal 
control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each 
major federal program to determine our auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing our opinion on compl iance for each major federal program and to test and report 
on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will 
not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control 
over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a 
type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal 
control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform 
Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
