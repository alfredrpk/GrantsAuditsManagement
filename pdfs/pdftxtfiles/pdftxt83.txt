INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

The Honorable Board of Education

Bristow School District No. I-2

Bristow, Creek County, Oklahoma

REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

I have audited the accompanying basic financial statements - regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each

major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of  Bristow School District No. I-2,Creek County,

Oklahoma (District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, as listed in the table of contents.

MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance

with financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  Management is also

responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and

fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITY

My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit.  I conducted my audit

in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the Untied States of America and the standards

applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of

the United States.    Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about

whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the

financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the

risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk

assessments, the auditor considers the internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation

of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not

for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, I express

no such opinion.  An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the

reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall

presentation of the financial statements.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit

opinions.

BASIS FOR ADVERSE OPINION ON U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by the Bristow School District Number I-2, on the

basis of the financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of

accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the

requirements of the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The effects of the financial statements on the

variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally

accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably determined, are presumed to be material.

ADVERSE OPINION ON U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “BASIS FOR ADVERSE OPINION ON

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES” paragraph, the basic financial statements

referred to in the first paragraph do not present fairly, in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted

in the United States of America, the financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the

aggregate remaining fund information of  Bristow School District No. I-2,Creek County, Oklahoma as of June 30,

2018, the changes in its financial position, or, where applicable, its cash flows for the year then ended.

OPINION ON REGULATORY BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

As discussed in Note 1E, the financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed assets account

group, which should be included in order to conform with the accounting and reporting regulations prescribed or

permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The amount that should be recorded in the general

fixed assets account group is not known.

In my opinion, the basic financial statements referred to in the first paragraph  present fairly, in all material

respects, the respective financial position - regulatory basis of the governmental activities, each major fund, and

the aggregate remaining fund information of  Bristow School District No .I-2,Creek County, Oklahoma (District),

as of June 30, 2018, and the respective changes in financial position - regulatory basis for the year ended on the

regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

OTHER MATTERS

Other Information

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise

the District’s basic financial statements.  The combining statements - regulatory basis, are presented for purposes

of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.  The schedule of expenditures

of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal

Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for

Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The combining statements - regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are the

responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying accounting and other

records used to prepare the basic financial statements.  Such information has been subjected to the auditing

procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including

comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to

prepare the basic financial statements to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures

in accordance with  auditing standards generally accepted in  the  United States of America.  In my opinion, the 

combining  statements  - regulatory basis and the schedule of expenditures of federal awards are fairly stated in all

material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. 

OTHER REPORTING REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated December 10, 2018 on my

consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with

certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that

report is to describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the

results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on

compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing

Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Sincerely,

BRISTOW SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-2

CREEK COUNTY, OKLAHOMA

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 30, 2018

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The basic financial statements of Bristow Public Schools Independent  District 

No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma ( the District) have been prepared in conformity

with an other comprehensive basis of accounting as prescribed by the Oklahoma

State Department of Education.  The more significant of the District’s policies

are described below.

 A. Reporting Entity

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of 

Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and 

financial reporting purposes.

The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general

direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially

dependent on State of Oklahoma support.  The general operating authority for the

public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma

Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected

members.  The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes,

management has considered all potential component units.  The decision to include

a potential component unit in the reporting entity was made by applying the

criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The

basic, but not the only, criterion for including a potential component unit

within the reporting entity is the governing body’s ability to exercise oversight

responsibility.  The most significant manifestation of this ability is financial

interdependency.  Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight

responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing

authority, the designation of management, the ability to significantly influence

operations, and accountability for fiscal matters.  A second criterion used in

evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service.  Application

of this criterion involves considering whether the activity benefits the District

and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is conducted within the geographic

boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons.  A third

criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion

from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships,

regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight

responsibilities.  Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no

potential component units included in the District’s reporting entity.  The

Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is not included in the reporting entity.  The

District does not appoint any of the board members or exercise any oversight

authority over the PTA.

B. Fund Accounting and Description of Funds

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position

and the results of its operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate

legal compliance and to aid financial management by segregating transactions

related to certain district functions or activities.  

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An

account group, on the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to

provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded

in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable available

financial resources.  Funds are classified into three categories: governmental,

proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided into separate “fund

types.”

Governmental Fund Types

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a governments’s general

activities, including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies

(special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets

(capital projects fund), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt

service fund).

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all transactions, except

those required to be accounted for in another fund.  Major revenue sources

include state and local property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and

Salary Incentive Aid Program.  Expenditures include all costs associated with the

daily operation of the schools except the programs funded for building repairs

and maintenance, child nutrition, school construction, and debt service on bonds

and other long-term debt.  The general fund includes federal and state restricted

monies that must be expended for specific programs.

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue fund includes the District’s Building

Fund and Child Nutrition Fund.  The Building Fund consists of monies derived from

property taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing

buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment.

The Child Nutrition Fund derives monies from the operation of the school lunch

and breakfast programs.

Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District’s sinking fund and is

used to account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of

general long-term debt principal, interest, and related cost.  The primary

revenue source is local property taxes levied specifically for debt service. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District’s Bond Fund and

is used to account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for

acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities,

renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation equipment.

B. Fund Accounting and Description of Funds, (continued)

Proprietary Fund Types

Proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in

the private sector, where the determination of the net income is necessary or

useful to sound financial administration. Goods and services from such activities

can be provided either outside parties (enterprise funds) or to other departments

or agencies primarily within the District (internal service funds).  The District

does not have Proprietary Funds at this time.

Fiduciary Fund Types

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside

partners, including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the

District. When these assets are held under the terms of a trust agreement, trust

funds are used for their accounting and reporting. Agency funds generally are

used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their

agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations.                 

Account Groups

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used

only to establish accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets

not accounted for in proprietary funds.

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to

account for all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount 

available in the debt service fund and the amount to be provided in future years

to complete retirement of the debt principal. It is also used to account for

liabilities for compensated absences and early retirement incentives, which are

to be paid from funds provided in future years.

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for

property, plant and equipment of the school district. The District does not have

information necessary to include this group in its combined financial statements.

Memorandum Only - Total Column

The total column on the financial statements is captioned “memorandum only” to

indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis.  Data in

this column does not present financial position, results of operations, or cash

flow in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Neither is

such data comparable to a consolidation.  Interfund eliminations have not been

made in the aggretion of this data.

C.  Basis of Accounting and Presentation

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is

prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  This format is

essentially the generally accepted form  of presentation used by the state and

local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic

Financial Statements - Management’s Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local

Governments.  This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34.

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash

receipts and disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the

Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) as follows:

! Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other

commitments for the expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures

when approved.

! Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased.

! Capital assets in proprietary funds are recorded when acquired and

depreciated over their useful lives.

! Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.

! Long-term debt is recorded when incurred.

! Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability

when the obligation is incurred.  

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally

accepted in the United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized

when they become available and measurable, or when they are earned, and

expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are

incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned and

liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund types and trust funds.

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.  A preliminary

budget must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal

year beginning the following July 1.  If the preliminary budget requires an

additional levy, the District must hold an election on the second Tuesday in

February to approve the levy.  If the preliminary budget does not require an

additional levy, it becomes a legal budget.  If an election is held and the taxes

are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget.  If voters

reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved

tax rate.

The District may upon approval by the majority of the electors of the District

voting on the question make the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local

support levy permanent.  The District electors have made the levies permanent.

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal budget is required for all funds except

for trust and agency funds.  Budgets are presented for all funds that include the

originally approved budgeted appropriations and final budgeted appropriations as

adjusted for supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget

categories.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued)

E. Assets, Liabilities, and Fund Equity

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The District considers all cash on hand, demand

deposits, and highly liquid investments, with an original maturity of three

months or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Investments - Investments consist of certificates of deposit or direct

obligations of the United States Government and Agencies with maturities greater

than three months when purchased.  All investments are recorded at cost, which

approximates market value.

Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property

taxes, which consists of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within

the District.  The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax

levies from the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for

submission to the County Treasurer prior to October 1.  The County Treasurer must

commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls.  The

first half of taxes are due prior to January 1.  The second half is due prior to

April 1.

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable

on January 2.  Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year

following the year of assessment.  If not paid by the following October 1, the

property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years

to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end of two

years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property.

Inventories - The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not known

but is not believed to be material to the basic financial statements.

Capital Assets - The General Fixed Assets Account Group is not presented.  The

amount which would be included in it is not known.  

Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to

be liquidated with expendable available financial resources is reported as an

expenditure and a fund liability of the governmental fund that will pay it. There

are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation leave that are not expected to

be liquidated with expendable available financial resources. 

Employees are allowed varying amounts of sick leave during the year in accordance

with Oklahoma Statutes.  Sick leave used during the year is recorded as an

expense in the governmental fund.  Vested accumulated rights to receive sick pay

benefits may be used in subsequent years, transferred to another District, or

added to years of service upon retirement.  Based on the District’s experience

it is not probable that District will pay for vested accumulated rights to

receive sick leave.  Therefore, a liability for vested accumulated sick leave has

not been recorded.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JUNE 30, 2018

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (continued)

E. Assets, Liabilities, and Fund Equity, (continued)

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental

fund when due or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund

for payment early in the following year.  For other long-term obligations, only

that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial

resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental fund.  The remaining

portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term debt account

group. 

Fund Balance - Fund balance represents the cash and investments not encumbered

by purchase order, legal contracts, and outstanding warrants.

F. Revenue, Expenses, and Expenditures

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily

governed by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title

70, Oklahoma Statutes.  The State Board of Education administers the allocation

of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the

districts.

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State

Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money

for prior year errors disclosed by review.  Normally, such adjustments are

treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is

made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical

education programs.  State Board of Education rules require that revenue

earmarked for these programs be expended only for the program for which the money

is provided.  These rules also require that the money not expended as of the

close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be

expended for the same categorical programs.  The State Department of Education

requires the categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in the

general fund.

Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as

revenues, expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute reimbursements

to a fund or expenditure/expenses initially made from it that are properly

applicable to another fund are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that

is reimbursed.

All other transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements,

are reported as transfers.  Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of

equity are reported as residual equity transfers.  All other interfund transfers

are reported as operating transfers.

2. Cash and Investments

The District’s investment policies are governed by state statute.  Permissible

investments include direct obligations of the United States Government and

Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings and loan associations, and bank and

trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of saving and loan

associations, and trust companies.  Collateral is required for demand deposits

and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit

insurance.  

Custodial Credit Risk

Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of failure of counterparty,

the District will not be able to recover the value of its deposits or

investments.  Deposits are exposed to custodial credit risk if they are uninsured

and uncollateralized.  Investment securities are exposed to custodial credit risk

if they are uninsured, are not registered in the name of the District, and are

held by counterparty or the counterparty’s trust department but not in the name

of the District.  The District’s policy requires that all deposits and

investments in excess of amounts covered by federal deposit insurance be fully

collateralized by the entity holding the deposits or investments.  As of June 30,

2018, all of the Districts deposits and investments were either covered by

federal deposit insurance or were fully collateralized. 

Deposits

The District had deposits at financial institutions with a carrying amount of

approximately $7,476,567 at June 30, 2018.  The bank balance of the deposits at

June 30, 2018 was approximately $7,495,858.

Credit Risk

Fixed-income securities are subject to credit risk.  However, the District did

not have fixed income securities at June 30, 2018.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely

affect the fair value of an investment.  The District’s Treasurer and Board of

Education monitor the District’s investment performance on an ongoing basis to

limit the District’s interest rate risk.  As of June 30, 2018, all of the

District’s deposits consisted of demand deposits and certificates of deposit.

3. General Long-Term Debt

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount

exceeding the revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the

District’s voters. Bond issues have been approved by the voters and issued by the

District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be fully

paid serially within 25 years from the date of issue.

CREEK COUNTY, OKLAHOMA

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

4. Employee Retirement System

The District participants in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement

System (the “System”), which is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer Public Employee

Retirement System administered by the Board of Trustees of the Oklahoma Teachers’

Retirement System.  The System provides retirement and disability benefits,

annual cost-of-living adjustments and death benefits to plan members and

beneficiaries.  Title 70 Section 17 of Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit

provisions and may be amended only through legislative action.

The System’s financial statements are prepared using the cash basis of

accounting, except for accruals of interest income.  Plan member contributions

are recognized in the period in which the contributions are made.  Benefits and

refunds are recognized when paid.  The pension benefit obligation is a

standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension benefits. This

pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension benefits

that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to

date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no

actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. The System has an

under funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the latest

actuarial valuation.

The District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employee make

contributions.  The contribution rates for the District and its employees are

established by and may be amended by Oklahoma Statutes. The contribution rates

for the Districts, which are not actuarially determined, and its employees are

established by statute and applied to the employee’s earnings, plus employer-paid

fringe benefits.  The required contribution for participating members is 7% of

compensation.  Additionally, OTRS receives federal matching contributions for

positions whose funding comes from federal sources or certain grants.  The

District and State are required to contribute 14% of applicable compensation. 

Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma are from 3.54%

of its revenue from sales tax, use tax, corporate income tax, and individual

income tax.  The District is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of

compensation.  The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement

System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating members. 

Ten-year historical trend information is presented in the Teacher’s Retirement

System of Oklahoma Annual Report for the year ended June 30, 2018. This

information is useful in assessing the pension plan’s accumulation of sufficient

assets to pay pension benefits as they become due.  The annual report may be

obtained by writing to Oklahoma Teacher’s Retirement System, PO Box 53524,

Oklahoma City, OK, 73152 or by calling 405-521-2387.

The Districts total contributions for 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $1,296,431,

$1,157,701, and $1,203,039 respectively.

5. Contingencies 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and

adjustments by grantor agencies.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts

already collected, may constitute a liability of the applicable funds.  The

amount, of expenditures which may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be

determined at this time, although the District expects such amounts, if any, to

be immaterial.  

6. Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risk of loss related to torts, theft of,

damage to, and destruction of assets, errors and omissions, injuries to

employees’s health and life, and natural disasters.  The District manages these

various risks of loss through the purchase of commercial insurance.  Management

believes such coverage is sufficient to preclude any significant uninsured losses

to the District.  Settled claims have not exceeded this insurance coverage in any

of the past three fiscal years.

7.    Subsequent Events

The District has considered subsequent events through December 10, 2018, the date

which the financial statements were available for release.  The District is not

aware of any subsequent events which would require disclosure.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

To the Board of Education

Bristow School District No. I-2

Creek County

Bristow, Oklahoma

I have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in
the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of
the United States, the accompanying basic financial statements - regulatory basis
of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining 
fund information of Bristow School District No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma
(District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to
the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s financial
statements, and have issued my report thereon dated December 10, 2018 which was
adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for
Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the presentation requirements
of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board.  The report did not include the

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing my audit, I considered the District’s internal 

control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of

expressing my opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of

expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control

over financial reporting.  Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the

effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting.

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the

preceding paragraph and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal

control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and

therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not

identified.  However, as described in the accompanying schedule of findings and

questioned cost, we identified certain deficiencies in internal control that we

consider to be material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control

does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their

assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely

basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,

in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material

misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or

detected and corrected on a timely basis.  I consider the deficiency described

in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as number 2018-1

and 2018-2 to be a material weakness.

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough
to merit attention by those charged with governance.  I consider the deficiencies
described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs number
2018-3 to be a significant deficiency.

Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial
statements are free of material misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance
with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements,
noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the
determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on
compliance with those provisions was not an objective of my audit, and accordingly,
I do not express such an opinion.  The results of my tests disclosed instances of
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government
Auditing Standards. These items are described in the accompanying schedule of
findings and questioned costs as item number 2018-1 and 2018-2.

Purpose of this Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of
internal control and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on
the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance.  This report
is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing
Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. 
Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH 

MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY UNIFORM GUIDANCE

To the Honorable Board of Education

Independent School District No. I-2

Bristow, Creek County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

I have audited Bristow School District No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma (the

District) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the 

OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of

the District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The

District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s

results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned cost. 

Management’s Responsibility

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws,

regulations, contracts, and grants applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor’s Responsibility

My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District’s

major federal programs based on my audit of the types of compliance requirements

referred to above.  I conducted my audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 

standards generally accepted in the United States of America, the standards

applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued

by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of

Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative

Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform

Guidance).  Those standards and Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform

the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types

of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material

effect on a major federal program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test

basis, evidence about the District’s  compliance with those requirements and

performing such other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstance. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance

for each major federal program.  However, my audit does not provide a legal

determination of the District’s compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

In my opinion, Independent School District No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma,

complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements

referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major

federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

Management of Independent School District No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma is

responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over

compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above.  In

planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the District’s

internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a

direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing

procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances  for the purpose of expressing

an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on

internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for

the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over

compliance.  Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness

Independent School District No. I-2, Creek County, Oklahoma’s internal control over

compliance.

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or

operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in

the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect 

and correct, noncompliance with the type of compliance requirement of a federal

program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance

is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over

compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility  that material

noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not

be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant
deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in
internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those
charged with governance.  

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose

described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify

all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material

weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  I did not identify any deficiencies in

internal control over compliance that I consider to be material weaknesses. 

However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to

describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the

results of that testing based on the requirements of Uniform Guidance. 

Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

BRISTOW SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. I-2

CREEK COUNTY, OKLAHOMA

SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COST

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018

Finding 2018-01

Condition: The District entered into a teacher contract with  a contract amount of

payment higher than the District’s salary schedule.  The teacher was paid per an

amount on the salary schedule. This resulted in the teacher being paid less than

the contract amount.

Criteria: Oklahoma State Statues, Title 70, states when a contract is entered into,

the contract shall be binding on the teacher and on the board of education until

the teacher legally has been discharged from the teaching position or released by

the board of education from the contract. The teacher was paid from the salary

schedule and not the contract. The contracted amount was higher than the salary

schedule.

Effect: The District underpaid the teacher per the contract amount. 

Recommendation: The District should review contracts to be certain they are in

agreement with the District salary schedule.  Any contracts which vary from the

salary schedule should be documented as to the reason. The District should consult

legal counsel concerning the underpayment to the employee.

District Response: The District has obtained a new contract with the correct amount

of salary shown.  We will review future contracts to insure the contract is within

the District salary schedule.

Finding 2018-02

Condition: A regular meeting of the Board of Education was held on a day other than

the scheduled date.

Criteria: The District approved 2018 meeting dates in November 2017 in accordance

with the Oklahoma Open Meetings Act. The January meeting date approved was

scheduled for January 15, 2018, however, the meeting was held on January 8, 2018.

The meeting should have been held as a rescheduled regular meeting or as a special

meeting.

Effect: The meeting held on January 8, 2018 as a regular meeting should have been

a special meeting or rescheduled regular meeting.

Recommendation: The District should insure all meeting dates approved are correct,

and the meeting is held on that date or follow procedures for a special meeting or

rescheduled regular meeting.

District Response: Board of Education meetings are held on the second Monday of

each month.  District personnel have reviewed the 2018 and 2019 schedules to make

certain the correct date is shown.  In the event a meeting cannot be held on the

approved day, the District will use special meeting procedures.
