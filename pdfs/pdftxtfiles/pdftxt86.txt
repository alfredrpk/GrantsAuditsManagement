Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Marietta School District I-16  
Marietta, Oklahoma 73448 
 
Report on the Financial Statements  
We have audited the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements of Marietta 
School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and 
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District’s regulatory 
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.   
 
Management’s Responsibility of the Financial Statements 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements 
in accordance with financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.   
 
Auditor’s Responsibility  
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, 
whether due to fraud or error. In making those risks assessments, the auditor considers internal 
control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting 
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, 
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepting Accounting Principles  
 
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements are prepared by Marietta School District I-16, 
Love County, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, to comply with the requirements of 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. The effects on the financial statements of the 
variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1 and accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not reasonably 
determinable, are presumed to be material. 
 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the “Basis for Adverse

for the year then ended.

As discussed in Note 1, the combined financial statements referred to above do not include the 
General Fixed Asset Account Group which should be included to conform with financial 
reporting provisions of Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The amount that should be 
recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group is not known. 
 
Qualified Opinion  
In our opinion, except for the effects of the matters described in the “Basis for Qualified Opinion 
on General Fixed Asset Account Group” paragraph, the financial statements referred to above 
present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund equity arising from 
regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of  Marietta School District I-
16, Love County, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues collected and expenses paid 
and budgetary results for the year then ended on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
The basic financial statements of the Marietta School District Number I-16, Love County, 
Oklahoma (the "District") have been prepared in conformity with an other comprehensive 
basis of accounting as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education.  The 
more significant of the District's accounting policies are described below. 
 
A. The Reporting Entity 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes.  
The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and 
control of the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on state of Oklahoma for 
support.  The general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma 
School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of five elected 
members.  The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the district, for financial reporting purposes, management has 
considered all potential component units.  The decision to include a potential component unit 
in the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental 
Accounting Standards Board (GASB).  The basic, but not the only, criterion for including a 
potential component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body's ability to 
exercise oversight responsibility.  The most significant manifestation of this ability is 
financial interdependency.  Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight 
responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of governing authority, the 
designation of management, the ability to significantly influence operations, and 
accountability for fiscal matters.  A second criterion used in evaluating potential component 
units is the scope of public service.  Application of this criterion involves considering 
whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is 
conducted within the geographic boundaries of the district and is generally available to its 
patrons.  A third criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or 
exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships, 
regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities.  Based upon 
the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units included in the 
District's reporting entity.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
 
B. Fund Accounting 
The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results 
of its operations.  Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid 
financial management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or 
activities. 

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts.  An account 
group, on the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability 
for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly 
affect net expendable available financial resources. 

Funds are classified into two categories:  governmental and fiduciary.  Each category, in turn, 
is divided into separate "fund types." 

Governmental Fund Types 
Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing 
of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 
 
General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those 
required to be accounted for in another fund.  Major revenue sources include state and local 
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program.  
Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for 
programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service 
on bonds and other long-term debt.  The general fund includes federal and state restricted 
monies that must be expended for specific programs. 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue fund consists of the District's Building Fund and 
Child Nutrition Fund.  The Building fund consists of monies derived from property taxes 
levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing 
furniture and equipment.   

The Child Nutrition Fund derives monies from local sources for meals.  Reimbursements are 
received from state and federal sources for reimbursement of free and reduced lunches.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
 
B. Fund Accounting – (continued) 
Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to 
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term 
debt principal, interest and related costs.  The primary revenue sources are local property 
taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's Bond Funds and is used to 
account for the proceeds from bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, 
constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring 
transportation equipment.   

Fiduciary Fund Types 

Agency Fund - The Agency fund is the School Activities fund which is used to account for 
monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-
sponsored groups.  The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of 
collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds. 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to 
establish accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets not accounted for in 
proprietary funds. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for 
all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service 
fund and the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt 
principal.   

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, 
plant and equipment of the school district.  The district does not maintain the fixed asset 
records necessary to account for this account group.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 

 
Memorandum Only - Total Column 
The total column on the basic regulatory financial statements is captioned "memorandum 
only" to indicate that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis.  Data in this column 
does not present financial position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.  Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation.  
Interfund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data. 

 
C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education.  This format is essentially the generally accepted 
form of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB 
Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements-Management’s Discussion and Analysis-for 
State and Local Governments.  This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 
34. 

 
The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education (OSDE) as follows: 

 Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments 
for the expenditure of monies and are recorded as expenditures when approved. 

 Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
 Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
 Long-term debt is recorded when incurred. 
 Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when 

the obligation is incurred. 
 
This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become 
available and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be 
recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types. 

  
Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of 
accounting requires the District to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain 
reported amounts and disclosures.  Accordingly, actual results may differ from those 
estimates.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
 
Noncash Transactions - The District received federal food commodities in the amount of 
$41,852.  
 
D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 
The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget.  A preliminary budget must 
be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the 
following July 1.  If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold 
an election on the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy.  If the preliminary budget 
does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget.  If an election is held and the 
taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget.  If voters reject 
the additional taxes the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate. 

 
The District has approved by a majority of the electors of the District voting on the question 
made the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local support levy permanent. 

 
Prior to September 1, the District must file with the county excise board, a budget for the 
current fiscal year including an itemized statement of estimate of needs and probable income 
from all sources including ad valorem taxes.  This budget, if not protested, becomes the legal 
budget for the District. 

 
Under current Oklahoma Statues a formal budget is required for all funds except for trust and 
agency funds.  Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally approved 
budgeted appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as adjusted for 
supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget categories. 
 
E. Assets Liabilities and Fund Equity 
Investments – The District’s investment policies are governed by Oklahoma Statutes. 
Permissible investments include direct obligations of the United States government and 
agencies, certificates of deposits of savings and loan associations, and bank and trust 
companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates of savings and loan associations, 
banks and trust companies. Collateral is required for all amounts not covered by FDIC 
insurance. 
 
Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which 
consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District.  The County 
Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the county excise board, extends 
the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer prior to October 1.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
 
The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax 
rolls.  The first halves of taxes are due prior to January 1.  The second half is due prior to 
April 1. 
 
If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2.  
Second half taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment.  
If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes 
due.  The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed.  
If at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the 
property. 
 
Inventories - The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the 
financial statements. 

 
Compensated Absences - Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be 
liquidated with expendable available financial resources is reported as an expenditure of the 
governmental funds that will pay it.  There are no amounts of vested or accumulated vacation 
leave. 

 
Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when 
due, or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in 
the following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed 
from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a 
governmental fund.  The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general 
long-term debt account group. 

 
Fund Balance - Fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase order, legal 
contracts, and outstanding warrants. 
 
E. Revenue, Expenses and Expenditures 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed 
by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.  
The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid funds to school districts 
based on information accumulated from the districts. Approximately 75% of the District’s 
general fund revenue comes from state sources.

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – (continued) 
 
After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department 
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors 
disclosed by review.  Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of 
revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 
 
The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational 
programs.  State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these programs 
be expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require that the 
money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the following 
year to be expended for the same categorical programs.  The State Department of Education 
requires that categorical education program revenues be accounted for in the general fund. 

 
Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, 
expenditures or expenses.  Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or 
expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are 
recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

 
All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions which are 
reimbursements, are reported as transfers.  Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers 
of equity are reported as residual equity transfers. 
 

2. Cash  
Custodial Credit Risk - Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that in the event of a bank 
failure, the District’s deposits may not be returned or the District will not be able to recover 
collateral securities in the possession of an outside party.  The District’s policy requires 
collateral for demand deposits and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by 
federal deposit insurance.  As of June 30, 2018, cash deposits were fully insured or 
collateralized by a pledging bank’s agent in the District’s name.  All funds were held as 
demand deposits at a local bank. 
 

3. General Long Term Debt 
State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the 
revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters.  Bond 
issues have been approved by the voters and issued by the District for various capital 
improvements.  These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from the 
date of issue.

establish and amend benefit provisions is the responsibility of the state legislature.  The 
System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and 
required supplementary information for the employees of the District. The System issues a 
publically available financial report that can be obtained at http://www.ok.gov/trs/. 

 
Benefits Provided – The System provides defined retirement benefits based on members’ 
final compensation, age, and term of service. In addition, the retirement program provides for 
benefits upon disability and to survivors upon the death of eligible members. Title 70 O.S. 
Sec. 17-105 defines all retirement benefits. The authority to establish and amend benefit 
provisions rests with the State Legislature.

4. Employee Retirement System (continued)  
 

Funding Policy—Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of 
Oklahoma and participating employees. Participation is required for all teachers and other 
certified staff and is options for all other employees of public education institutions who 
work at least 20 hours per week.  
 
Contributions – In accordance with Oklahoma Statutes, System members are required to 
contribute 7.00% of applicable compensation.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, qualifying 
employee contributions were reduced by a retirement credit of $52,207 provided by Enrolled 
House Bill 1873 and paid by the State of Oklahoma as on-behalf payments.  For the year 
ended June 30, 2018, the District had a statutory contribution rate of 9.5% plus 7.80% as a 
match for salaries funded by federal programs.  The contribution requirements of System 
members and the District are established and may be amended by the state legislature.  For 
the year ended June 30, 2018, the District contributions to the System for were $477,637. 
 

The State of Oklahoma, a non-employer contributing entity, provides funds through 5% of 
the State’s sales, use, corporate and individual income taxes collected. The System receives 
1% of the cigarette taxes collected by the State and 5% of net lottery proceeds collected by 
the State.  The District’s estimated share of these contributions based on their covered payroll 
for the measurement period was $280,569. 

Pension Liability and Pension Expense  

At June 30, 2018, the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability was 
$6,674,531. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total pension 
liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as 
of that date. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of 
the District’s long-term share of the contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected 
contributions of all participating school districts, actuarially determined. At June 30, 2017, 
the District’s proportion was 0.10058960%, which was an 0.00113795% decrease of the 
proportion measured as of June 30, 2016. 

For the year ended June 30 2018, the District had pension expense of $700,429.  

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a 
building block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return 
(expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for 
each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of 
return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation 
percentage and by adding expecting inflation.

4. Employee Retirement System (continued)  
 

The target asset allocation and best estimates of arithmetic expected real rates of return for 
each major asset class as of June 30, 2017, are summarized in the following table: 

Asset Class
Target 

Allocation

Long-Term 
Expected Real 
Rate of Return

Fixed Income 23.50% 2.50%
Domestic Equity 38.50% 7.50%
International Equity 19.00% 8.50%
Real Estate 9.00% 4.50%
Alternative Assets 10.00% 6.10%

100.00%
 

Discount rate –A single discount rate of 7.50% was used to measure the total pension 
liability as of June 30, 2017. Previously, the System had used an 7.50% discount rate for 
prior year. This single discount rate was based solely on the expected rate of return on 
pension plan investments of 7.50%. Based on the stated assumptions and the projection 
of cash flows, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and future contributions were 
projected to be available to finance all projected future benefit payments of current plan 
members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments 
was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension 
liability. 

Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability to changes in 
the discount rate – The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net 
pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s 
proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a 
discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher 
(8.50%) than the current rate:

fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued TRS financial report that can be 
obtained at http://www.ok.gov/trs/. 

5.  Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)  

In addition to the retirement plan described in Note 4, the District participates in the state-
administered  Supplemental Health Insurance Program (OPEB Plan) within Teachers’ 
Retirement System of Oklahoma (the OPEB System), which is a cost-sharing multiple-
employer defined benefit OPEB plan administered by the Teacher Retirement System 
(TRS). 

Plan Description – The OPEB System provides pays a monthly health insurance premium 
supplement for each retired member who is enrolled in the health insurance plan provided 
by the State and Education Employees Group Health and Dental Insurance plan or in an 
insurance program provided by a participating education employer who provides health 
insurance coverage to former employees, provided the retired member had at least ten 
(10) years of Oklahoma service prior to retirement.  

Benefits Provided – All retirees are eligible except for special retirees (as defined) and 
spouses and beneficiaries as long as they have at least 10 years of service.  Retirees who 
elect such coverage receive the smaller of (i) a Medicare supplement benefit, if eligible, 
or (ii) an amount between $100 and $105 per month, depending on service and final 
average compensation. Payments made on the retirees’ behalf to the Employees Group 
Insurance Division of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, if the member 
continues health coverage under that Plan, or (ii) to the member’s former employer, if the 
member retains health coverage under a plan maintained by the former employer. 

Contributions – Employer and employee contributions are made based upon the TRS 
Plan provisions contained in State Statute Title 70, as amended. However, the statutes do 
not specify or identify any particular contribution source to pay the health insurance 
subsidy. The cost of the subsidy averages 0.15% of normal cost, as determined by an 
actuarial valuation. 

At June 30, 2018, the District reported an asset  of  $44,857 for its proportionate share of 
the net OPEB asset. The net OPEB asset was measured as of June 30, 2017, and the total 
OPEB asset used to calculate the net OPEB asset was determined by an actuarial 
valuation as of that date. The District’s proportion of the net OPEB asset was based on a 
projection of the District’s long-term share of the contributions to the OPEB plan relative 
to the projected contributions of all participating school districts, actuarially determined.

5.  Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) (continued)  

At June 30,2017, the District’s proportion was 0.10058960%, as compared to  its 
proportion share of 0.10172755% measured as of June 30, 2016. 

See Note 4. Employee pension plans for Actuarial assumptions, measurement,

Sensitivity of the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB asset to changes in the 
discount rate – The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net OPEB 
asset calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as what the District’s 
proportionate share of the net OPEB asset would be if it were calculated using a discount 
rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than 
the current rate:

6. Contingencies  
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by 
grantor agencies.  Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may 
constitute a liability of the applicable funds.  The amount, if any, of expenditures which may 
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the District expects 
such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
 

7. Risk Management  
 
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and 
destruction of assets; error and omissions and natural disasters for which the District carries 
commercial insurance. There have been no significant reductions in coverage from prior year 
and settlements have not exceeded coverage in the past three years.

8. Tax Abatement  

 
The State of Oklahoma has authorized Oklahoma State Statutes Title 31 to offer Homestead 
and Veterans exemptions to Ad Valorem property taxes.  These exemptions reduce ad 
valorem taxes remitted to the District.  For the year ended June 30, 2018, the district had 
approximately $69,790 in abated ad valorem tax revenues.   
 

9. New GASB Standards 
GASB Statement No.75, Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions establishes 
standards for recognizing and measuring liabilities, deferred outflows and inflows of 
resources and expenses/expenditures. Furthermore, this statement details the recognition and 
disclosure requirements for employers with payables to defined benefit OPEB plans that are 
administered by trusts that meet the specified criteria and for employers whose employees 
are provided with defined contribution OPEB. Since the District prepares the financials under 
a cash receipts and disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma 
Department of Education, the net OPEB liability (asset) is not required to be presented in 
these financial statements, but has disclosed the District’s portion of net OPEB liability 
(asset) in the note disclosures.   
 

10. Subsequent Event  
 
August 2018, the voters of the District approved $1,205,000 General Obligation building 
bonds to renovate, repair and/or remodel the track building, as needed; construct and equip a 
new softball locker room buildings and to construct and install new bleachers and press box 
at the football field.   
 
November 2018, the District issued $1,205,000 of General Obligation Building Bonds of 
2018.  The Bonds are due $185,000 on the 1st day of November, 2020 and $255,000 in each 
of the year 2021 to 2024, both inclusive, and bearing interest from their date until paid at 
various rates between 2.75-3.00%, paid semi-annually on the 1st day of May and November 
of each year, commencing on the 1st day of May, 2020.   
 
The District has evaluated subsequent events through January 3, 2019, the date which the 
financial statements were available to be issued.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED 
ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE  

WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 
 
 
 
The Honorable Board of Education 
Marietta School District I-16 
Marietta, Oklahoma 73448 
  
 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller of the United States,  the accompanying fund type 
and account group financial statements of Marietta School District I-16, Love County Oklahoma, 
as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, 
which collectively comprise the Marietta School District I-16, Love County Oklahoma’s 
regulatory financial statements and have issued our report thereon dated January 3, 2019. Our 
report included an adverse opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and a 
qualified opinion due to the omission of the general fixed asset account group.  
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Marietta School 
District I-16 Love County, Oklahoma’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) 
to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on effectiveness Marietta School District I-16 Love County, Oklahoma’ internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Marietta School District I-16 
Love County, Oklahoma’s internal control.  
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to 
prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

The Honorable Board of Education 
Marietta School District I-16 
Marietta, Oklahoma 73448 
 
 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
We have audited Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have 
a direct and material effect on each of Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Marietta School District I-16, Love 
County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results 
section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 
Management’s Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, 
and grants applicable to its federal programs. 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Marietta School District I-
16, Love County, Oklahoma’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance 
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 
200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal 
Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the 
types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect 
on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
about Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each 
major federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Marietta 
School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s compliance. 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma, complied, in all material 
respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct 
and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  
Other Matters  
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance which are required 
to be reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2018-006, 2018-007 and 2018-
008. Our opinion on each major federal program is not modified with respect to these matters.   
Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s response to these noncompliance 
findings identified in our audit is described in the accompanying schedule of findings and 
questioned costs.  Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s response was not 
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we 
express no opinion on the response.   
Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 
Management of Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma, is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, 
we considered Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s internal control over 
compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each 
major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform 
Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal 
control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 
Marietta School District I-16, Love County, Oklahoma’s internal control over compliance. 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing 
their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal 
control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on 
a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control 
over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in 
the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal

Section II – Financial Statement Findings 
 
2018-001  Financial Reporting 
Condition:  The District does not have a financial reporting system in place to 

ensure that all financial information is disclosed in the appropriate 
accounting period and in accordance with the regulatory basis of 
accounting and State Department of Education guidelines. In 
addition, the District does not report a general fixed asset account 
group as required by the State Department of Education guidelines. 

Criteria:   The responsibility for the financial statements remains with 
management even when the preparation of the financial statements 
is transferred to a service provider. An individual with sufficient 
awareness of disclosure requirements should be designated to 
oversee the preparation of the financial statements. 

Cause: The internal control structure of the District focuses primarily on 
daily operations. The District does have a system of financial 
reporting that determines the trial balances used in financial 
statement preparation are final. The District does not currently 
have a system in place to determine appropriate financial statement 
disclosures. The District also does not have a system for 
accounting for general fixed assets. 

Effect:  Potential that financial statement disclosures will be incomplete. 
Scope limitation on the audit for the general fixed asset account 
group. 

Recommendation: We recommend that the District evaluate the costs of providing for 
the additional assistance needed for the year-end financial 
reporting process to determine it is in accordance with accounting 
and regulatory requirements. 

Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: The District’s current budget constraints do not allow for the 

addition of an outside consultant to assist in the year-end financial 
reporting process. Management reviews disclosures as presented to 
determine that they are accurate.

2018-002  Activity Fund Receipts  
Condition:  Proper documentation was not kept or completed to support the 

amount of funds being remitted to activity fund custodian. In 
addition, funds are not being turned in timely to activity fund 
custodian to ensure timely deposits.   

Criteria:   State Department of Education regulations require receipts to be 
issued for all revenues received. Oklahoma Statutes 70-5.129 
requires receipts equal or exceeding $100 to be deposited by the 
following business day or weekly if less than $100.     

Context: Eight out of Twenty Five receipts tested did not have proper 
documentation that supported the activity fund custodian receipt, 
(i.e. inventory reconciliation of items sold or supporting receipts).  
One out of twenty-five receipts tested did not remit funds to 
activity fund custodian timely.  

Cause: Failure to follow State regulations and statutes  
Effect:  Lack of compliance with state regulations and statutes and risk of 

misappropriation of assets  
Recommendation: We recommend that the following policies and procedures be 

implemented 
1. Inventory/Items Sold Reconciliations needs to be completed if 

individual receipts are not issued.   
2. Teacher/Sponsor Receipts are totaled and reconciled to cash 

when deposited with District activity fund custodian. To ensure 
all items are in agreement.   

3. Remind sponsors of state statutes requiring the timely deposits 
and they need to remit funds daily to activity fund custodian.      

Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: November 2018, the District has been working with staff on 

getting inventory/item sold reconciliations completed and receipts 
issued for all revenues.  District has also reminded staff of the 
district requirements of timely deposits.

and $50,000 and secure sealed bids on items more than $50,000.    
Context: Three out of twenty four purchase orders tested did not follow 

district purchasing policy. All exceptions were 
construction/building improvement type projects.  

Cause: Failure to follow District policies   
Effect:  Lack of compliance with board policy and risk of misappropriation 

of assets  
Recommendation: We recommend that all employees be made aware of purchasing 

requirements per District policy. In addition, District needs to 
monitor projects that need to be completed before year end, so 
there is adequate time to properly obtain quotes or bids.     

Views of Responsible Officials

Action: District is in agreement with recommendation and will work 

towards improving compliance in this area.

material in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) 
or more, shall be accompanied by a non-kickback affidavit.  

Context: Three of twenty four purchase orders tested did not non-kickback

 of Building Fund by state law, spending down the Impact Aid 

funds is taking time.    
Effect:  Risk of noncompliance with federal regulations and 

misappropriation of assets.    
Recommendation: We recommend that procedures be implemented to monitor the 

interest earned on federal funds until all funds have been spent by 
the District.

2018-007  Child Nutrition Cluster – School Breakfast Program and National School 

Lunch Program – CFDA #10.553 & 10.555  
Condition:  Meal count submitted was not in agreement with supporting 

records.      
Criteria:   7 CFR Chapter 2 Section 210.8(a) Claims for reimbursement: 

Internal Controls--The School food authority shall establish 
internal controls which ensure the accuracy of lunch counts prior to 
the submission of the monthly claim for reimbursement.   

Context: Two months of a 3 month sample in a population of 12, over 
claimed meals served in categories: reduced and full pay. This 
resulted in an estimated error of $306 due to condition noted 
above.    

Cause: The District’s edit check report was not reconciled to the amounts 
claimed and supplement report related to 4 year old program meals 
included in count were not properly supported.     

Effect:  Over claim of meals served and claimed.   
Recommendation: We recommend procedures need to be implemented to ensure 

secondary review of supporting reports to final claim amount, 
before claims are finalized and submitted.        

Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: November 2018, Child Nutrition Director after preparing claim, 

will have their assistant initial and date claim that supporting

2018-008  Child Nutrition Cluster – School Breakfast Program and National School 

Lunch Program – CFDA #10.553 & 10.555  
Condition:  Incorrect eligibility determined based on application      
Criteria:   7 CFR Chapter 2 Section 245.6c Determination of Eligibility: the 

local education agency must determine household eligibility for 
free or reduced priced meals either through direct certification or 
the application process at or about the beginning of the school 
year.   

Context: One out of forty applications tested had incorrect eligibility 
determined due to incorrect household sized used by office to what 
was actually recorded on the application.  This resulted in an 
estimated error of $832 due to condition.  

Cause: One individual recaps the application information into an office 
use section, which then the office use section is used to input into 
the computer system. During transfer of information from 
application to office use section, household size of 6 was 
inadvertently entered as 7, and thus application was determined as 
reduced instead of full pay based on the income and household size 
of 6.      

Effect:  Over or under reimbursement from Federal Government due to 
inaccurate eligibility determined.     

Recommendation: We recommend procedures need to be implemented to ensure 
secondary review of data entry between the application and 
computer system, to ensure amount are properly supported.    

Views of Responsible Officials 
and Planned Corrective 
Action: November 2018, any applications received will be reviewed by 

second person once entered into system to ensure data has been 
properly transferred from application to office use section and 
eligibility properly determined.  Applications must be taken at face 
value, but any conflicting information, can be clarified.
