Independent Auditors' Report 
 
 
 

The Board of Directors 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.  
Fairfax, Oklahoma 

 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. (a nonprofit 
organization), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the related 
statements of activities, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial 
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our 
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of 
the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk 
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no 
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion.

Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the changes in its net assets and its 
cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America.  
 
Other Matters 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole.  The 
accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial 
statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements.  The information has been 
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional 
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.  In our 
opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 31, 2018 on our 
consideration of Fairfax Medical Facilities Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The 
purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial 
reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards in considering Fairfax Medical Facilities Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting and 
compliance.

FAIRFAX MEDICAL FACILITIES, INC. 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 

Note 1. Organization 
 

Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. (the Organization) was incorporated on September 5, 1995, 
as a non-profit corporation.  The stated purpose of the Organization is to provide health care 
services to the residents of Fairfax, Oklahoma and surrounding area regardless of age, sex, 
race, creed, color, national origin, or ability to pay.  The Organization provides medical 
services to the medically underserved. 
 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Principles 
 

The following summarizes certain significant accounting policies followed in the 
preparation of these financial statements: 
 

Contributions 
 

In accordance with Authoritative Guidance contributions received, including unconditional 
promises to give, are recognized as support in the period received at their fair values.  For 
financial reporting purposes, Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. distinguishes between 
contributions of unrestricted assets, temporarily restricted assets, and permanently restricted 
assets.  Contributions for which donors have not stipulated restrictions, as well as 
contributions for which donors have stipulated restrictions which are met within the same 
reporting period, are reported as unrestricted support.  Contributions for which donors have 
imposed restrictions which limit the use of the donated assets are reported as temporarily 
restricted support if the restrictions are not met in the same reporting period. 
 

When such donor imposed restrictions are met in subsequent reporting periods temporarily 
restricted net assets are classified to unrestricted net assets and reported as net assets 
released from restrictions.  Contributions of assets which donors have stipulated must be 
maintained permanently, with only the income earned thereon available for current use, are 
classified as permanently restricted assets.  For the period ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. had no temporarily or permanently restricted assets. 
 

Recognition of Income 
 

Patients are charged for medical and dental services based on established standard rates, less 
discounts based on a sliding scale schedule according to family size and income.  Included 
in other revenues are amounts reimbursable from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party 
programs under the provisions of reimbursement formulas in effect.  Final determination of 
amounts earned is subject to audit by fiscal intermediaries.  No estimated provisions have 
been made for adjustments that may result from such audits.  Differences between amounts 
previously received and final settlement are reflected in future periods as final settlements 
are determined. 
 

Grant funds are recognized as income over the term of the grant period.  Unearned grant 
funds are reported as deferred income.

Notes to the Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Recognition of Income (continued) 
 

Unapplied program income represents that portion of program income which was not used 
to reduce the federal share of the DHHS grant, as authorized by the grantor.  Such funds are 
calculated according to specified formula, and may be expended by Fairfax Medical 
Facilities, Inc. for any purpose which furthers the objectives of the program. 
 

Donated materials and services are reflected as contributions at their estimated fair values at 
the date of receipt.  Nonfederal in-kind contributions are recorded as offsetting income and 
expense amounts at their estimated values at the date of receipt.  No amounts have been 
reflected in the statements for donated personnel services (other than nonfederal in-kind). 
 

Basis of Accounting 
 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America. 

 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 

Cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits, cash on hand, and money market 
accounts. 
 

Property and Equipment 
 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful life of the asset as prescribed by the American Hospital 
Association.  Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred.  Donated 
property and equipment are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of receipt. 
 

Property and equipment acquired under grants from the DHHS is considered to be owned 
by Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. while used in the program for which it was purchased or 
in other future authorized programs; however, DHHS and GSA have a reversionary interest 
in the property; its disposition, as well as the ownership of any proceeds therefrom is subject 
to federal regulations. 
 

Income Taxes 
 

Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. is a not-for-profit corporation as described in Section 
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and is exempt from federal income taxes on related 
income to Section 501(a) of the Code. 
 

Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. files a 990 information return in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. is generally no longer subject to examination by the Internal 
Revenue Service for years before 2015.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued) 
 

Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and 
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
 
Expense Allocation 
 
The costs of providing various programs and other activities have been summarized on a 
functional basis in the Statement of Activities and in the Statement of Functional Revenue 
and Expenses.  Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs and 
supporting services benefited. 

 
Federal and State Contracts 
 
The Organization receives funding through federal and state contracts.  Acceptance of these 
contacts requires compliance with contract conditions.  Any costs disallowed by the 
contracts must be paid by non-governmental funds. 

 
Note 3. Grant Revenue 

 
The Organization is the recipient of a Consolidated Health Centers (“CHC”) grant from the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The general purpose of the grant is to 
provide expanded health care service delivery for residents of Fairfax, Hominy and 
Newkirk, Oklahoma, and the surrounding areas.  Terms of the grant generally provide for 
funding of the Organization’s operations based on an approved budget.  Grant revenue is 
recognized as qualifying expenditures are incurred over the grant period.  The Organization 
recognized $3,371,950 and $2,364,690 in revenues from this grant for the years ended June 
30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Organization’s present CHC grant award covers the 
grant year ending March 31, 2018 and it authorized for funding in the amount of 
$2,756,104. 

 
Note 4. Grants/Contracts Receivable 

 
Grants/contracts receivable at June 30, 2018 and 2017 consisted of the following: 

2018 2017

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 277,364$      344,888$

Total Receivable - Patients 300,002$      490,266$      
Less Allowance for Uncollectible (120,060)      (301,586)      

Total 179,942$      188,680$      

The allowance for uncollectible accounts is based on management's estimate of potential bad 
debts and the aging of all Accounts Receivable as of June 30, 2018 and 2017. 

 
Note 6. Compensated Absences 

 
Paid Day Off (PDO) is a time-off policy for eligible employees to use for vacation. Employees 
in the following employment classification(s) are eligible to earn and use PDO as described in 
this policy. 
 

• Regular full-time employees 
 

• Regular part-time employees 
 
Once employees enter an eligible employment classification, they begin to earn PDO 
according to the schedule below. However, before PDO can be used, a waiting period of 90 
calendar days must be completed. After that time, employees can request use of earned PDO. 

 
The amount of PDO employees receive each year increases with the length of their 
employment as shown in the following schedule: 
 

• Upon initial eligibility the employee is entitled to 5 PDO days each year, accrued 
biweekly. 

 
• After 1 year of eligible service the employee is entitles to 10 PDO days each year, 

accrued biweekly. 
 

• After 10 years of eligible service the employee is entitled to 15 PDO days each year, 
accrued biweekly. 

 
Holidays will be paid at the rate of 8 hours per Holiday. Holidays do not require the use of 
PDOs. 
 
The length of service is calculated on the basis of a “benefit year”. This is the 12-month period 
that begins when the employee starts to earn PDO. An employee’s benefit year, may be 
extended for any significant leave of absence expect military leave of absence. Military leave 
has effect on this calculation.

Note 6. Compensated Absences (continued) 
 

PDO can be used in minimum increments of two (2) hours. Employees who have an 
unexpected need to be absent from work should notify their direct supervisor before the 
scheduled start of their workday, if possible. The direct supervisor must also be contacted on 
each additional day of unexpected absence. 
 
Leave may be taken any time between January 1 and December 31, subject to the convenience 
of the Agency. Employees shall file a request with their supervisor at least two weeks prior to 
their desired leave date. Under no circumstances may PDO be used prior to being accrued. 
Neither does paid time off accrue during periods of leave of absence without pay, suspension, 
or layoff. 
 
Upon reasonable notice, a supervisor may request an employee use a portion of his/her accrued 
paid time off for stated purposes (e.g. extended bereavement and FMLA) at any time this is 
deemed advisable. 
 
An employee may carry over up to a maximum of 160 hours at a year end (December 31). 
Employees may cash in leave hours once a year to be paid the first paycheck in December. 
These employees must be able to maintain a minimum balance of 40 hours PDO at time of 
cash-in request. This cash in of PDO must be approved by the CEO. 
 
Upon termination of employment, employees will be paid for unused PDO that has been 
earned through the last day of work. 
 
Separation/Death 
 1. Separation - An employee will be paid for paid time off at the next regular pay 
 period after the date of separation. 
  
 2. Death - In case of death of an employee, payment will be delivered to the 
 employee’s beneficiary, estate or as otherwise provided by law. 

 
A liability for unpaid compensated absences of $119,756 and $118,110 has been recorded as 
of June 30, 2018 and 2017 respectively.

grants from federal and state agencies. A significant reduction in the level of revenue from these 
agencies could have a material effect on the Organization’s programs, activities and operations. 

 
Note 10. Contingencies 

 
During the normal course of business, the Center is involved in various claims and lawsuits.  In 
the opinion of management, the potential loss on any claim and lawsuit, net of insurance 
proceeds, will not be significant to the Center’s financial position or results of operations.

The Center is located in Fairfax, Oklahoma.  The Center grants credit without collateral to its 
patients, most of whom are local residents and are uninsured or under insured.

The Center wrote off $2,738,533 in sliding-scale discounts, uncollectible accounts and 
contractual adjustments for the year ended June 30, 2018.

services to other individuals, various community agencies, and to the broader community.  
These services are provided at no charge to the public and include such items as health 
education and promotion, blood pressure and cholesterol screening, and health assessments.

      Net Capital Assets $ 3,889,425    $ 4,057,402    

 
Note 15. Service Contracts and Grants 

 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. derives a majority of its revenue from service contracts and 
grants from federal and state agencies. A significant reduction in the level of revenue from 
these agencies could have a material effect on the Organization’s programs, activities and 
operations. 

 
Note 16. Net Patient Service Revenue 

 
The Organization is approved as a FQHC for both Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement 
purposes.  The Organization has agreements with third-party payers that provide for payments 
to the Organization at amounts different from its established rates. 
 
 
 
 

14 



FAIRFAX MEDICAL FACILITIES, INC. 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 

Note 16. Net Patient Service Revenue (continued) 
 
These payment arrangements include: 

 
Medicare – Covered FQHC services rendered to Medicare program beneficiaries are 
paid based on a prospective reimbursement methodology.  The Organization is 
reimbursed a set encounter rate for certain services provided.  Services not covered 
under the FQHC benefit are paid based on established fee schedules. 
 
Medicaid – Covered FQHC services rendered to Medicaid programs beneficiaries are 
paid based on a prospective reimbursement methodology.  The Organization is 
reimbursed a set encounter rate for certain services provided.  Services not covered 
under the FQHC benefit are paid based on established fee schedules. 

 
Approximately 65% and 61% of net patient service revenues are from participation in the 
Medicare and state-sponsored Medicaid programs for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 
2017, respectively.  Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid programs are 
complex and subject to interpretation and change.  As a result, it is reasonably possible that 
recorded estimates will change materially in the near term. 
 
Patient service revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, for the years ended June 
30, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 

 
2018 2017

Total Patient Service Revenue 7,367,308$        6,761,776$        
Less:  Total Contractual, Sliding Fee and 
   Bad Debt Adjustment (2,738,583)         (1,892,790)         

     Net Patient Service Revenue 4,628,725$        4,868,986$        

 
 
The Organization has also entered into payment agreement with certain commercial insurance 
carriers, health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.  The basis for 
payment to the Organization under these agreements includes prospectively determined rates 
per unit of service and discounts from established charges. 
 

Note 17. Medical Malpractice Claims 
 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has deemed the Organization and its 
practicing providers covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for damage for 
personal injury, including death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental and 
related functions.  FTCA coverage is comparable to an occurrence policy without a monetary 
cap. The Organization has adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 
2010-24, Health Care Entities (topic 954):  Presentation of Insurance Claims and Related  

15 



FAIRFAX MEDICAL FACILITIES, INC. 
Notes to the Financial Statements 

June 30, 2018 and 2017 
 

Note 17. Medical Malpractice Claims (continued) 
 
Insurance Recoveries, which eliminates the practice of netting claim liabilities with expected 
insurance recoveries for balance sheet presentation.  Claim liabilities are to be determined 
without consideration of insurance recoveries.  Expected recoveries are presented separately.  
Prior to the adoption of ASU 2010-24, accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America required a health care provider to accrue only an estimate of the malpractice 
claims cost for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported where the risk of a 
loss had not been transferred to a financially viable insurer.  There was no impact of ASU 
adoption to the Organization’s financial statements. 

 
Based upon the Organization’s claim experience, no accrual has been made for the 
Organization’s medical malpractice costs for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.  
However, because of the risk in providing health care services, it is possible that an event has 
occurred which will be the basis of a future material claim. 
 
 

Note 18. Functional Expenses 
 

The Organization provides health care services primarily to residents within its geographic area. 
 Expenses related to providing these services are as follows: 
 

2018 2017

Health Care Services 3,710,131$        3,860,054$        
General and Administrative 3,636,627          3,445,674          

   Total Expenses 7,346,758$        7,305,728$        

 
 
 

Note 19.  Significant Estimates and Concentrations 
 

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require disclosure of 
certain significant estimates and current vulnerability due to certain concentrations.  Those 
maters include the following: 
 
Grant Revenues – Concentration of revenues related to grant awards and other support is 
described in Note 3. 
 
Allowance for Net Patient Service Revenue Adjustments – Estimates of allowances for 
adjustments included in net patient service revenue are described in Notes 2, 5 and 16.

Note 19.  Significant Estimates and Concentrations (continued) 
 
Malpractice Claims – Estimates related to the accrual for professional liability claims are 
described in Note 17. 

 
Current Economic Conditions – The current protracted economic decline continues to present 
community health centers with circumstances and challenges, which in some cases have 
resulted in declines in the fair value of investments and declines in contributions.  The financial 
statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to the 
Organization. 
 
Current economic conditions have made it difficult for certain of our patients to pay for services 
rendered.  As employers make adjustments to health insurance plans or more patients become 
unemployed, services provided to self-pay and other payers may significantly impact net patient 
service revenue, which could have an adverse impact on the Organization’s future operating 
results.  Further, the effect of economic conditions on the state may have an adverse effect on 
cash flows related to the Medicaid program. 
 
Given the volatility of current economic conditions, the values of assets and liabilities recorded 
in the financial statements could change rapidly and negatively impact the Organizations

Subsequent events have been evaluated through October 31, 2018, which is the date 
the financial statements were available to be issued.

SINGLE AUDIT SUPPLEMENT 



INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS 

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
 
 

 
The Board of Directors 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. 
Fairfax, Oklahoma 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Fairfax 
Medical Facilities, Inc. (a nonprofit organization), which comprise the statement of financial position 
as of June 30, 2018, and the related statements of activities, and cash flows for the year then ended, 
and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated October 
31, 2018. 
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Fairfax Medical 
Facilities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the 
financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Fairfax 
Medical Facilities, Inc.’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s internal control.  
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 
or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit 
attention by those charged with governance.  
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Fairfax Medical Facilities Inc.’s financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could 
have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, 
providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and 
accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing 
Standards. 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed 
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the organization’s internal control 
and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR 
 EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER 

 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
 
 
 
The Board of Directors 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. 
Fairfax, Oklahoma 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 
2018. Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of 
auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Fairfax Medical Facilities, 
Inc.’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally 
accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in 
Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the 
audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  
Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s 
compliance with those requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered 
necessary in the circumstances.  
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Fairfax Medical 
Facilities, Inc.’s compliance.  
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. complied, in all material respects, with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 

Management of Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Fairfax Medical 
Facilities, Inc.’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a 
direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each 
major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with 
the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 
Fairfax Medical Facilities, Inc.’s internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the 
first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements 
of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
