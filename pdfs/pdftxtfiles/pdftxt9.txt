INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

To the Board of Education  
Stilwell Public School, I-25 
Stilwell, Oklahoma 

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements – regulatory basis of the 
Stilwell School District No. I-25 (the School), Adair County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, 
as listed in the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education as 
described in Note 1, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the State of Oklahoma; this includes determining 
that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the preparation of the financial statements in the 
circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control 
relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, 
whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in 
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable 
to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement.  

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my adverse and 
qualified audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the Oklahoma State 
Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by the School on the basis of the financial reporting 
regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting 
other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 
1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America, although not reasonably determinable, 
are presumed to be material.

1



Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles paragraph, the financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in  
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of 
the School, as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in net position and, where applicable, cash 
flows thereof for the year then ended. 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is a departure 
from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department of Education noted 
above. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset account group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

In my opinion, except for the effects of the omission of the general fixed asset account group, the combined financial 
statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund 
balances arising from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of the School as of June 30, 
2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered, of each fund type, for the year then ended, 
on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 

Other Matters 

Other information 

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial statements 
within the combined financial statements. The combining statements-regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in 
the table of contents, under other supplementary information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are 
not a required part of the combined financial statements of the District. Also, the accompanying schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the financial statements. 

The combining statements-regulatory basis and the other supplementary information, including the schedule of 
expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly 
to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial statements-regulatory basis. Such 
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account 
group financial statements within the combined financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records 
used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional 
procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In my 
opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis and the other supplementary information, including the 
schedule of expenditures of federal awards, are fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the combined 
financial statements-regulatory basis taken as a whole on the regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated December 3, 2018, on my 
consideration of the School's internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to 
describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that 
testing and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is 
an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School’s 
internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

STILWELL SCHOOL DISTRICT No. I-25 
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – REGULATORY BASIS 

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 
 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 
The financial statements of the Stilwell Public School District No. I-25 (the "District") have been 
prepared on a regulatory basis of accounting, which is an other comprehensive basis of accounting 
than generally accepted accounting principles.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial 
statements are not intended to present financial position and results of operations in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles.  The accounting policies are prescribed by the 
Oklahoma Department of Education and conform to the system of accounting authorized by the 
State of Oklahoma.  The following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies: 
 
A. Reporting Entity 
 
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma 
Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The 
District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of 
the State Board of Education and is financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support. The 
general operating authority for the public school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained 
in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 
 
The governing body of the District is the Board of Education (Board), composed of five elected 
members. The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. The Board, 
constituting an on-going entity, is the level of government which has governance responsibilities 
over all activities related to public elementary and secondary school education within the 
jurisdiction of the Local Independent School District. The District receives funding from local, 
state and federal government sources and must comply with the requirements of these funding 
source entities. The District is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined 
in Section 2100, Codification of Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, 
since Board members are elected by the public and have decision making authority, the power to 
designate management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary 
accountability for fiscal matters. 
 
In evaluating how to define the district, for financial reporting purposes, management has 
considered all potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in 
the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting 
Standards Board (GASB). The basic -- but not the only --criterion for including a potential 
component unit within the reporting entity is the governing body's ability to exercise oversight 
responsibility. The most significant manifestation of this ability is financial interdependency. 
Other manifestations of the ability to exercise oversight responsibility include, but are not limited 
to, the selection of governing authority, the designation of management, the ability to significantly 
influence operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in evaluating 
potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion involves 
considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or whether the activity is 
conducted within the geographic boundaries of the District and is generally available to its patrons. 
A third criterion used to evaluate potential component units for inclusion or exclusion from the 
reporting entity is the existence of special financing relationships, regardless of whether the 
District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities.

Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential component units included in the 
District's reporting entity. 
 
B. Measurement Focus 
 
The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its 
operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial 
management by segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities. 
 
A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account group, on 
the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets 
and liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable 
available financial resources. 
 
Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each category, 
in turn, is divided into separate "fund types." 
 
Governmental Fund Types 
 
Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, 
including the collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the 
acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing of 
general long-term debt (debt service funds). 
 
General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those 
required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local 
property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid Program. Expenditures 
include all costs associated with the daily operations of the schools except for programs funded 
for building repairs and maintenance, school construction and debt service on bonds and other 
long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and state restricted monies that must be 
expended for specific programs. 
 
Special Revenue Fund - The first special revenue fund is the District's Building Fund. The Building 
fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, 
or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment. 
 
The second special revenue fund is the Child Nutrition Fund, a special revenue fund used to 
account for monies derived from federal and state reimbursement and local food service collection. 
 
Debt Service Fund - The debt service fund  is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account 
for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal,  
interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically 
for debt service and interest earnings from temporary investments. 
 
Capital Projects Fund - The capital projects fund is the District's Bond Fund and is used to account 
for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and 
equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and acquiring transportation 
equipment. 

8



 
 

 
Proprietary Fund Types 
 
Any proprietary funds are used to account for activities similar to those found in the private sector, 
where the determination of net income is necessary or useful to sound financial administration. 
Goods or services from such activities can be provided either to outside parties (enterprise funds) 
or to other departments or agencies primarily within the District (internal service funds).  The 
District does not have any proprietary funds.
 
Fiduciary Fund Types 
 
Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including other 
governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held under the 
terms of a formal trust agreement, either a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund 
is used. The terms "nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to whether or not the District is under 
an obligation to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets 
that the District holds on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results 
of operations. 
 
Agency Fund - The Agency fund is the School Activities fund which is used to account for monies 
collected principally through fund-raising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. 
The administration is responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing and 
accounting for these activity funds. 
 
Account groups  
Are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to establish accounting 
control over long-term debt and general fixed assets not accounted for in proprietary funds. 
 
General Long-Term Debt Account Group - This account group was established to account for all 
long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount available in the debt service fund and 
the amount to be provided in future years to complete retirement of the debt principal. It is also 
used to account for liabilities for compensated absences and early retirement incentives which are 
to be paid from funds provided in future years. 
 
General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for property, plant 
and equipment of the school district.  The district does not maintain a record of its general fixed 
assets, and accordingly, a statement of general fixed assets, required by generally accepted 
accounting principles, is not included in the financial statements.  Land, buildings, nonstructural 
improvements, and all other physical assets in all funds are considered expenditures in the year of 
acquisition and are not recorded as assets for financial statement purposes.  
 
Memorandum Only - Total Column 
 
The total column on the financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate that it 
is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial 
position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting 

9



principles. Neither is such data comparable to a consolidation. Interfund eliminations have not 
been made in the aggregation of this data. 

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the 
Oklahoma State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally accepted form 
of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement 
No. 34, Basic Financial Statements – Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local 
Governments. This format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education (OSDE) as follows: 

a. Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments for the
expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures when approved.

b. Investments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased.
c. Inventories of school supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as assets.
d. Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.
e. Long-term debt is recorded when incurred.
f. Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and liability when the

obligation is incurred.
g. A General Fixed Asset Account Group is required or expected by the Department of

Education and is presented in such an account group but is not depreciated.
h. Management’s Discussions and Analysis (MD&A) is not required to be presented.

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they become available 
and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the 
related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned. 

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounts and 
reported in the financial statements. Basis of accounting relates to the timing of measurements 
made, regardless of the measurement focus applied. All governmental type funds are accounted 
for using the Regulatory (Statutory) basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when they are 
received rather than earned. Under the Statutory basis of accounting, expenditures are generally 
recognized when encumbered/reserved rather than at the time the related fund liability s incurred, 
Fiduciary type funds are accounted for using the cash basis of accounting. These practices differ 
from generally accepted accounting principles. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must be 
submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year beginning the following 
July 1. If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold an election on 

10



the first Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If the preliminary budget does not require an 
additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. If an election is held and the taxes are approved, then 
the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. If voters reject the additional taxes, the District 
must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate. 

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue 
Funds (Building Fund and Child Nutrition Fund) and the Debt Service Fund, that includes revenues 
and expenditures. 

The 2017-18 estimate of needs was approved by the Board and subsequently filed with the County 
Clerk.  The Estimate of Needs was approved by the excise board and the requested levies were 
made. 

E. Encumbrances

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services. 
Encumbrance accounting -- under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are 
recorded as expenditures of the applicable fund -- is utilized in all governmental funds of the 
District.  Appropriations not used or encumbered lapse at the end of the year. 

F. Assets Liabilities and Fund Equity

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The District considers all cash on hand, demand deposits and highly 
liquid investments, with an original maturity of three months or less. 

Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States Government and 
Agencies with maturities greater than three months when purchased. All investments are recorded 
at cost, which approximates market value.  

Inventories - The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the 
financial statements.  Purchases for inventory items are considered expenditures at the time the 
items were encumbered. 

Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment - The General Fixed Asset Account Group is 
not presented.  The amount that should be recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group is 
not known. 

11



Compensated Absences – Vested or accumulated vacation leave that is expected to be liquidated 
with expendable available financial resources has not been reported as an expenditure or a fund 
liability of the governmental fund that will pay it since the combined financial statements 
have been prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. Vested accumulated rights to receive 
sick pay benefits have not been reported in the general long-term debt account group since the 
combined financial statements have been prepared on the regulatory basis of accounting. 
These practices differ from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of 
America. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due, 
or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in 
the following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to be financed 
from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability of a governmental 
fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term debt account 
group.  

Fund Balance - Fund balance represents the funds not encumbered by purchase order, legal 
contracts, and outstanding warrants. 

In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the hierarchy of fund balances. The 
hierarchy is based primarily on the degree of spending constraints placed upon use of resources 
for specific purposes versus availability of appropriation. An important distinction that is made 
in reporting fund balance is between amounts that are considered nonspendable (i.e., fund 
balance associated with assets that are not in spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid 
items, long-term portions of loans and notes receivable, or items that are legally required to 
be maintained intact (such as the corpus of a permanent fund) and those that are spendable (such 
as fund balance associated with cash, investments or receivables). 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, committed, 
assigned or unassigned, as appropriate. 

• Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally by creditors
(such as debt covenants), grantors, contributors or laws or regulations of other governments;
or by law, through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

• Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific purposes by
formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority. Such amounts
are not subject to legal enforceability (like restricted amounts), but cannot be used for any
other purpose unless the government removes or changes the limitation by taking action
similar to that which imposed the commitment. The School Board is the highest level of
decision-making authority of the School District.

• Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for specific purposes,
but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by the governing body itself, or a

12



 
 

subordinated high-level body or official who the governing body has delegated the authority 
to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Assigned fund balances includes all 
remaining spendable amounts (except negative balances) that are reported in governmental 
funds other than the general fund that are neither restricted nor committed, and amounts in 
the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance with the 
provisions of the standard. 
 
• Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. It represents the 
amounts that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not been restricted, 
committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the general fund. 
 
G. Revenue, Expenses and Expenditures 
 

Property Tax Revenues and Other Local Revenues - The District is authorized by state law 
to levy property taxes which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property 
within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies 
from the County Excise Board, extends the tax levies on the roll for submission to the 
County Treasurer prior to October 1. The County Treasurer must commence tax collection 
within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes is due prior to January 
1. The second half is due prior to April 1. If the first payment is not made timely, the entire 
tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half taxes become delinquent on April 
1 of the year following the year of assessment. If not paid by the following October 1, the 
property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem 
the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. If at the end of two years the owner 
has not done so, the purchaser is issued a deed to the property. No provision has been made 
for uncollected taxes, as all taxes deemed collectable. Other local sources of revenues 
include tuition, fees, rental, disposals, commissions, and reimbursements. 

 
Intermediate Revenues -Revenue from intermediate source is the amount of money 
from funds collected by an intermediate administrative unit, or a political subdivision 
between the district and the state, and distributed to districts in amounts that differ in 
proportion to those which were collected within such systems. 

 
State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily 
governed by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, 
Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state 
aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts. After 
review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department 
of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year 
errors disclosed by review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as reductions or 
additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made. 

 
The District receives revenue from the State to administer certain categorical 
educational programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked 

13



for these programs be expended only for the program for which the money is provided 
and require that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried 
forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The 
State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues 
be accounted for in the General Fund. 

Federal Revenues - Federal revenues consist of revenues from the federal government 
in the form of operating grants or entitlements. An operating grant is a contribution to 
be used for a specific purpose, activity or facility. A grant may be received either 
directly from the federal government or indirectly as a pass through from another 
government, such as the state. Entitlement is the amount of payment to which the 
District is entitled pursuant to an allocation formula contained in applicable statutes. 
The majority of the federal revenues received by the District are apportioned to the 
general fund. The District maintains a separate child nutrition fund and the federal 
revenues received for the child nutrition programs are apportioned there. 

Non-Monetary Transactions — The District receives commodities from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. The value of these commodities has been included in the Schedule of Expenditures 
of Federal wards; however, they have not been reflected in the combined financial statements as 
either revenue or expense since they are not reported under the regulatory basis of accounting. 

Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures 
or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or expenditures/expenses 
initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund, are recorded as 
expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, are 
reported as transfers. Nonrecurring or nonroutine permanent transfers of equity are reported as 
residual equity transfers. All other interfund transfers are reported as operating transfers.   

Use of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the 
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. 

2. Cash and Investments

The District's investment policies are governed by state statute. Permissible investments include 
direct obligations of the United States Government and Agencies; certificates of deposit of savings 
and loan associations, and bank and trust companies; and savings accounts or savings certificates 
of savings and loan associations, and trust companies; Collateral is required for demand deposits 
and certificates of deposit for all amounts not covered by federal deposit insurance.  As of 
the current fiscal year end, the District’s bank balance was $1,925,088. This balance was covered 
by FDIC and collateral pledged by the bank.

Therefore, the District’s cash deposits and investments at June 30, 2018, were not exposed to 
Custodial Credit Risk, Investment Credit Risk, Investment Interest Rate Risk, or Concentration of 
Investment Credit Risk. The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits 
investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from 
increasing interest rates. 
 
3. Interfund Receivables and Payables 
 
There were no interfund receivables and payables at June 30, 2018. 
 
4. General Long-term Debt 
 
State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to 
be received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters.  General long-term debt 
of the District consists of capital leases.   
 
The District has entered into lease agreements, which qualify as capital leases for accounting 
purposes since title transfers at the end of the lease term, as follows:  
 
 

 
 
As disclosed in Note 1 of the financial statements, the District does not record fixed assets in the 
financial statements.   Consistent with this, the District has not recorded the leased equipment as 
assets in the General Fixed Assets Account Group.  The District has recorded the liability for future 
lease payments in the General Long-term Debt Account Group. 
Changes in the Capital Lease Obligations are shown as follows:

5. Other Post Employment Benefits  
 
The District does not offer any early retirement incentive plans. 
 
6. Employee Retirement System 
 

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System (the 
"System"), which is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement system 
(PERS). Under the system, contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and the 
participating employees. 

Participation is required for all teachers and other certified employees and is optional for all other 
regular employees of public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. A 
participant's date of membership is the date the first contribution is made to the System. The 
System is administered by a Board of Trustees which acts as a fiduciary for investing the funds 
and governing the administration of the System. The District has no responsibility or authority 
for the operation and administration of the System nor has it any liability, except for the current 
contribution requirements. 

A participant with five years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement allowance 
at the age of sixty-two or with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five. The normal retirement 
allowance paid monthly for life and then to beneficiaries, if certain options are exercised, equals 
two percent of the average of the highest three earning years on contributory service multiplied 
by the number of years of credited service. A participant leaving employment before attaining 
retirement age, but completing ten years of service, may elect to vest his accumulated 
contributions and defer receipt of a retirement annuity until a later date.  

When a participant dies in active service and has completed ten years of credited service, the 
beneficiary is entitled to a death benefit of $18,000.00 and the participant's contributions plus 
interest. If the beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the surviving spouse may, in lieu of the death 
benefit, elect to receive, subject to the surviving spousal options, the participant's retirement 
benefits accrued at the time of death.   

 
The contribution rates for the District, which are not actuarially determined, and its employees 
are established by law. The District is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable

compensation for the year ended June 30, 2018. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma 
Teacher’s Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating 
members. The required contribution for participating members is 7%. 
 
The District’s contributions to the System for the years ending 
 
June 30, 2018 is $730,100 
June 30, 2017 is $727,212 
June 30, 2016 is $722,294 
 
The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of 
pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension 
benefits that will be paid in future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is 
adjusted for the effect of projected salary increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed 
on individual school districts. The Oklahoma Teachers’ Retirement System issues a publicly 
available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary 
information for the System.  

The system issues an independent financial report, financial statements, and required 
supplementary information that may be obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement 
System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling 405-521-2387. 
 
7. Contingencies and Other Commitments 
 
Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment by 
grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute a 
liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which may be disallowed by 
the grantor cannot be determined at this time although the District expects such amounts, if any, 
to be immaterial. 
 
8. Risk Management 
 
The District purchases commercial insurance policies covering property casualty loss, public 
liability, school board member and administrator liability, and workers compensation. The District 
also purchases surety bonds for employees in all positions required by state law to be bonded. 
Management believes such coverage is sufficient to preclude any significant uninsured losses to 
the District. 
 
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and destruction 
of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases 
commercial insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, 
and public officials liability. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the 
commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. 
 
The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which 
there is a transfer or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In accordance with 
GASB No. 10, the School reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as 

17



insurance expense. The risk pool is the Oklahoma School Assurance group (OSAG), an 
organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' compensation coverage to 
participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for 
providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract 
arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and 
legal defense for any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of 
OSAG, the District is required to pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment 
schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The 
fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based on the schools losses for the 
last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the District's liability 
for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use their loss 
fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest. 
The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment Compensation 
Program. In this program, the District is required to contribute 1.6% of their taxable payroll for 
unemployment. The funds for each District are kept separate. The money contributed by each 
District does not earn interest and is fully insured. If the district has claims in excess of the amount 
of their account, they would be liable for the excess. 

9. Accumulated Unpaid Vacation, Sick Leave Benefits, and Health Care Coverage

The District provides sick leave benefits to the certified staff in accordance with Title 70, Article 
6-104, of the Oklahoma Statutes, which provides for an annual accrual of sick leave of ten days
and personal business days accrual of three days. Ten days are allowed to accumulate up to a total
of sixty days per employee. None of the benefits are payable upon retirement or death.

10. Subsequent Events

Subsequent events have been evaluated through the date of the auditor’s report, which is the date 
the financial statements were available to be issued.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND 
ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF COMBINED FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

To the Board of Education 
Stilwell Public School, I-25 
Stilwell, Oklahoma  

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller 
General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory basis 
of Stilwell School District No. I-25 (the School), Oklahoma as listed in the Table of Contents, as of and for the year 
ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the School’s 
financial statements, and have issued my report thereon dated December 3, 2018, which was adverse with respect to 
the presentation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and 
did not conform to the presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, my 
report was qualified for the omission of general fixed asset account groups with respect to the presentation of 
financial statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing my audit, I considered the School’s internal control over financial reporting (internal 
control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing my 
opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
School's internal control. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or 
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct misstatements 
on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that 
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

My consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and 
was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be significant deficiencies or material 
weaknesses. Given these limitations during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that I 
consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the school’s financial statements are free of material 
misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant 
agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of my 
audit, and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of my tests disclosed no instances of 
noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards. 

26



Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's control or on compliance. This 
report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the 
entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S 
REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM  

AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED 
BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

To the Board of Education 
Stilwell School District No. I-25, 
Adair County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

I have audited the Stilwell School District No. I-25, Adair County, Oklahoma (the School) with the types of 
compliance requirements described in Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance) 
that could have a direct and material effect on each of the School's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 
2018. The School's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of federal statutes, regulations, and terms 
and conditions of federal awards. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

My responsibility is to express an opinion on the School's compliance based on my audit. I conducted my audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the 
United States, and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance). 
Those standards and the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance) 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types 
of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program 
occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the School’s compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstances. 

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance with each major federal program. 
However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the School’s compliance.  

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In my opinion, the School complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 
2018.  

28



Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of the School is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance 
with the types of compliance referred to above. In planning and performing my audit of compliance, I considered the 
School’s internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect 
on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the 
purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal 
control over compliance in accordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance), 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, 
I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control over compliance.  

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance 
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or 
detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A 
material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal 
control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of 
compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A 
significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal 
control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with 
governance.  

My consideration of the internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance 
that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.  

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal 
control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulation (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards, (The Uniform Guidance). Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
