Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc., HUD 
Project No. 118-HD026, (the "Project"), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 
2018, and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related 
notes to the financial statements. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opmIon on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from 
material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating 
the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for 
our audit opinion. 

Opinion 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. as of June 30, 2018, and the changes in net 
assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. 
The accompanying supplementary information shown on pages 12 to 17 is presented for purposes of 
additional analysis as required by the Consolidated Audit Guide for Audits of HUD Programs issued by 
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of the Inspector General, and is not a 
required part of the financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, 
as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, is presented for purposes of 
additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the 
responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and 
other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other 
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial 
statements as a whole. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated August 16, 
2018 on our consideration of Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s internal control over financial 
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to solely describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to 
provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s internal control over 
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance 
with Government Auditing Standards in considering Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance.

Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 
(A Nonprofit Corporation) 

HUD Project No. 118-HD026 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
June 30, 2018 

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The Project consists of six three-unit group homes for persons with disabilities located in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. The Project is operated under Section 811 of the National Housing Act and regulated 
by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to rental charges 
and operating methods. 

Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc., a corporation sponsored by Volunteers of America of 
Oklahoma, Inc., holds legal title to the Project. The accompanying financial statements include 
only the assets and related liabilities of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 

The Project also is subject to Project Rental Assistance Contracts with the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and a significant portion of the Project's rental income is 
received from HUD. 

The Project's regulatory agreement with HUD stipulates, among other things, that the Project will 
not make distributions of assets or income to any of its officers and directors. 

The following significant accounting policies have been followed in the preparation of the financial 
statements: 

Basis of Accounting: The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting, which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 

Subsequent Events: The financial statements and related disclosures include evaluation 
of events up through and including August 16, 2018, which is the date the financial 
statements were issued. 

Revenue Recognition: Rental income is recognized as rentals become due. Rental 
payments received in advance are deferred until earned. All leases between the Project 
and the tenants are operating leases. Rental income is recorded net of vacancies. 
Under the Regulatory Agreement, the Project may not increase rents charged to tenants 
without HUD approval. 

Functional Expenses: Expenditures incurred in connection with project operations and 
expenditures made for entity purposes have been summarized on a functional basis in 
the Statement of Activities. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: For the purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the 
Project considers all highly liquid investments purchased with maturities of three months 
or less to be cash equivalents. 

Concentration of Credit Risk: The project maintains its cash in financial institutions 
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Deposit accounts, at 
times, may exceed federally insured limits. The project has not experienced any losses 
in such accounts. 

Allowance for Uncol/ectible Receivables: Tenant receivables are charged to bad debt 
expense when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon a periodic review of 
the accounts by management. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America require that the allowance method be used to recognize bad debts; 
however, the effect of using the direct write-off method is not materially different from the 
results that would have been obtained under the allowance method.

(A Nonprofit Corporation) 

HUD Project No. 118-HD026 

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 
June 30, 2018 

Depreciation: The Project's land, building, improvements, and personal property are 
recorded at cost. Improvements are capitalized, while expenditures for maintenance and 
repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is provided by the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful life of the asset. 

Buildings 
Land and Building Improvements 
Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment 

40 years 
15-38 years 
7 years 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The Project reviews its long-lived assets for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value 
may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying 
amount to the future net undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated and any 
estimated proceeds from the eventual disposition. If the long-lived asset is considered to 
be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured at the amount by which the 
carrying amount exceeds the fair value as determined from an appraisal, discounted cash 
flows analysis, or other valuation technique. There is no impairment loss recognized for 
the period ending June 30, 2018. 

Other Liabilities: Accrued expenses for compensated absences, vacations, and sick pay 
are not shown due to the fact that amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated. 
It is the Project's policy to expense these items when they are incurred. 

Interest Expense: There is no interest expense. 

Income Taxes: Neither the Project nor its nonprofit corporate owner is subject to federal 
income taxes under IRC 501 (C)(3). The Project files information returns in the U.S. 
federal jurisdiction. Federal and state tax authorities generally have the right to examine 
and audit the previous three years of tax returns filed. There are no interest and 
penalties related to income taxes recognized in the statement of activities. The Project 
has not taken any tax positions that would significantly increase or decrease any 
unrecognized tax benefit within twelve months of the reporting date. 

Estimates: The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, requires management to 
make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Economic Concentrations: The Project's primary asset is its 18-unit apartment project. 
The Project's operations are concentrated in the multifamily housing real estate market. 
In addition, the Project operates in a regulated environment. The operations of the 
Project are subject to the administrative directives, rules and regulations of federal, state, 
and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, HUD. Such administrative 
directives, rules, and regulations are subject to change by an act of Congress, or an 
administrative change mandated by HUD. Such changes may occur with little notice or 
inadequate funding to pay for the related cost, including the additional administrative 
burden, to comply with a change.

2. Financing 

Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 
(A Nonprofit Corporation) 

HUD Project No. 118-HD026 

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 
June 30, 2018 

Section 811 of the National Housing Act authorized HUD to provide funds as capital advances to 
nonprofit owners for new construction or acquisition/rehabilitation of supportive housing facilities. 
This capital advance note shall bear no interest and repayment is not required so long as the 
housing remains available for very low-income persons with disabilities for at least 40 years in 
accordance with Section 811 of the National Housing Act, the Regulatory Agreement and HUD 
Regulations. Failure to keep the housing available for disabled persons would result in HUD's 
billing the owner for the entire capital advance of $1,419,756 plus 5.250% interest since the date 
of the first advance. The capital advance is classified in the statement of financial position as 
debt. The maturity date of the capital advance is September 29, 2045. 

3. Related Party-Identity of Interest 

Related Party: Volunteers of America of Oklahoma, Inc. 
Relationship: Sponsor 
Transactions: Management, Payroll, and Reimbursable Expenses 
Amount paid for services: $24, 182 
Amount payable at June 30, 2018: None 

4. Management Fee 

The Project has contracted with Volunteers of America of Oklahoma, Inc. to provide management 
services. The charges for these services are based upon a management agreement. The 
charges are 10.34% of collected rental income not to exceed $43.91 per unit, per month. For the 
period ended June 30, 2018, management fees charged amounted to $9,484. There is no 
balance owed Volunteers of America of Oklahoma, Inc. at June 30, 2018. 

5. Restricted Funds 

Under the Regulatory Agreement, the Project is required to establish and maintain a replacement 
reserve account for the replacement of property and other project expenditures as approved by 
HUD. The Project is also required to complete a computation of surplus cash. Surplus cash is 
the cash remaining after all expenses of the project are paid less current obligations of the current 
reporting period. If surplus cash exists, the Project is required to deposit surplus cash into a 
residual receipts account within 90 days of the Project's year-end. Restricted funds are held in 
separate accounts and generally are not available for operating purposes. 

6. Unrestricted Net Assets 

None of the Project's net assets are subject to donor-imposed restrictions. Accordingly, all net 
assets are accounted for as unrestricted net assets.

HUD Project No. 118-HD026 

Notes to the Financial Statements (continued) 
June 30, 2018 

7. Residual Receipts Contingency 

Regulations require the return of residual receipts to HUD unless the funds are authorized by 
HUD to be retained by the Project for possible future uses. The use of these funds is contingent 
upon HUD's prior written approval. On June 19, 2015 HUD issued a directive that they will 
require the return of residual receipts balances in excess of $250 per unit ("retained balance"), 
upon expiration of the Project Rental Assistance Contract, subject to certain conditions. The 
expiration date of the Project Rental Assistance Contract is July 31, 2018. The amount in excess 
of the retained balance at June 30, 2018 is $2,939. The required deposit to the Residual 
Receipts account for current period surplus cash is $10,853. The required deposit was not used 
to calculate the current period retained balance. 

8. Accounts Receivable from HUD 

"Accounts Receivable-HUD" includes $4,524 due for the July 2015 TRACS vouchers. 

9. Accounts and Notes Receivable-Operations 

"Accounts and Notes Receivable-Operations" includes $929 due from the project sponsor.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

Independent Auditors' Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and 
on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of Financial Statements 

Performed in Accordance With Government Auditing Standards 

To the Directors 
Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards 
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Hope Housing of 
Green Country, Inc., which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2018, and the 
related statements of activities, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated August 16, 2018. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Hope Housing of Green 
Country, lnc.'s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures 
that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial 
statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Hope Housing of 
Green Country, lnc.'s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of 
Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or 
detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a 
timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a 
direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an 
opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not 
express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed instances of noncompliance or other matters 
that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards which are described in the 
accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2018-001 and 2018-002.

Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s Response to Findings 

Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s response to the findings identified in our audit are described in the 
accompanying schedule of findings, questioned costs, and recommendations. Hope Housing of Green 
Country, lnc.'s response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial 
statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on it. 

Purpose of this Report 

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Independent Auditors' Report on Compliance for Each Major Program and 
on Internal Control Over Compliance Required by the Uniform Guidance 

To the Directors 
Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the 0MB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect 
on each of Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 
2018. Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s major federal programs are identified in the summary of 
auditor's results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and 
grants applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Hope Housing of Green Country, 
lnc.'s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to 
above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted 
in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and Title 2 U.S. Code of 
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance 
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect 
on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Hope 
Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s compliance with those requirements and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Hope Housing of Green 
Country, lnc.'s compliance. 

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
In our opinion, Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. complied, in all material respects, with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

Other Matters 
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed instances of noncompliance, which are required to be 
reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance and which are described in the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2018-001 and 2018-002. Our opinion on each major 
federal program is not modified with respect to these matters. 

Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s response to the noncompliance findings identified in our audit are 
described in the accompanying corrective action plan. Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s response 
was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we 
express no opinion on the response.

Report on Internal Control Over Compliance 

Management of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In 
planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s 
internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that could have a direct and material 
effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program 
and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Hope Housing of Green Country, lnc.'s 
internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a 
deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a 
reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in 
internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over 
compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material 
weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged 
with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 
Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Independent Accountants' Report on Applying Agreed-Upon Procedures 

To the Directors 
Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. 

We have performed the procedure described in the second paragraph of this report, which was agreed to by 
Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc., (A Nonprofit Corporation), HUD Project No. 118-HD026 and the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, Public Indian Housing-Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-
REAC), on whether the electronic submission of certain information agrees with the related hard copy 
documents within the audit reporting package. Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. is responsible for the 
accuracy and completeness of the electronic submission. The sufficiency of the procedure is solely the 
responsibility of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. and PIH-REAC. Consequently, we make no 
representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedure described below either for the purpose for which this 
report has been requested or for any other purpose. 

We compared the electronic submission of the items listed in the "UFRS Rule Information" column with the 
corresponding printed documents listed in the "Hard Copy Documents" column. The associated findings from 
the performance of our agreed-upon procedure indicate agreement or non-agreement of the electronically 
submitted information and hard copy documents as shown in the attached chart. 

This agreed-upon procedure engagement was conducted in accordance with the attestation standards 
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the standards applicable to attestation 
engagements contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States. We were not engaged to and did not conduct an examination or review, the objective of which would be 
the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively, on whether the electronic submission of the items listed 
in the "UFRS Rule Information" column agrees with the related hard copy documents within the audit reporting 
package. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional 
procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you. 

We were engaged to perform an audit in accordance with the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of the 
Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements 
for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), by Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and have issued our reports thereon dated August 16, 2018. The information in the "Hard Copy 
Documents" column was included within the scope, or was a by-product of that audit. Further, our opinion on 
the fair presentation of the supplemental financial data templates dated August 16, 2018, was expressed in 
relation to the basic financial statements of Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. taken as a whole. 

A copy of the financial statement package required by the Uniform Guidance, which includes the auditors' 
reports, is available in its entirety from Hope Housing of Green Country, Inc. We have not performed any 
additional auditing procedures since the date of the aforementioned audit reports. Further, we take no 
responsibility for the security of the information transmitted electronically to the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, PIH-REAC. 

The purpose of this report on applying the agreed-upon procedures is solely to describe the procedure 
performed on the electronic submission of the items listed in the "UFRS Rule Information" column and the 
associated findings, and not to provide an opinion or conclusion. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any 
other purpose.
