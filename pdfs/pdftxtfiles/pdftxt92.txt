Independent Auditors' Report 

 
The Board of Directors 
East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.  
Wetumka, Oklahoma 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of East Central Oklahoma Family Health 
Center, Inc. (a nonprofit organization), which comprise the statement of financial position as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of activities and changes in net assets, 
statement of functional expenses and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to 
the financial statements. 
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this 
includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation 
and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due 
to fraud or error. 
 
Auditors’ Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement.  
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether 
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to 
design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express 
no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis 
for our audit opinion.

Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. as of December 31, 2018 
and 2017, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  
 
Other Matters 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. 
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost 
Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional 
analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility 
of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing 
procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements, and certain additional procedures, 
including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and 
other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and 
other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation 
to the financial statements as a whole. 
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 29, 
2019 on our consideration of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center Inc.’s internal control 
over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to 
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the 
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over financial reporting or 
on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards in considering East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center Inc.’s internal 
control over financial reporting and compliance.

EAST CENTRAL OKLAHOMA FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, INC. 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 

 
Note 1. Organization 

 
East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. (Organization/Center) was incorporated 
on December 22, 2005, as a 501 (c) (3) non-profit corporation. The stated purpose of the 
Organization is to provide health care services to the residents of Wetumka, Oklahoma and 
surrounding area regardless of age, sex, race, creed, color, national origin, or ability to pay.  
The Organization provides medical services to the medically underserved. 
 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
 

The following summarizes certain significant accounting policies followed in the 
preparation of these financial statements: 
 
Basis of Presentation:  Financial statement presentation follows the recommendations of the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) which requires that resources be 
classified for reporting purposes based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed 
restrictions. 
 
Basis of Accounting:  The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of 
accounting.  Accordingly, the statement of financial position reflects all significant 
receivables, payables, and other assets and liabilities.  In the statement of activities and 
changes in net assets, revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses are recognized 
when an obligation has been incurred.  The Organization follows FASB Accounting 
Standards Codification (“ASC”), which integrates existing standards with other 
authoritative guidance.  The ASC provides a single source of authoritative GAAP for 
nongovernmental entities and supersedes all other previously issued non-SEC accounting 
and reporting guidance. 
 
Use of Estimates:  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make 
estimate and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and 
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results 
could differ from those. 
 
Cash and Outstanding Checks in Excess of Bank Balances:  The Organization maintains its 
cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, some of which may not be federally 
insured.  The Organization has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it 
is not exposed to significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents.  Accounts whose 
outstanding checks are in excess of bank balances are classified as current liabilities for 
financial reporting purposes. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents: The Organization considers all liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, 
the Organization did not hold any cash equivalents.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
 

Patient Accounts Receivable:  The Organization reports patient accounts receivable for 
services rendered at net realizable amounts from third-party payers, patients, and others.  
The Organization provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon a review of 
outstanding receivables, historical collection information, and existing economic conditions. 
As a service to the patient, the Organization bills third-party payers directly and bills the 
patient when the patient’s liability is determined.  Patient account receivables are due in full 
when billed.  Accounts are considered delinquent and subsequently written off as bad debts 
based on individual credit evaluation and specific circumstances of the account. 

 
Supplies and Pharmacy Inventory:  The Organization states supply and pharmacy 
inventories at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out method, or market. 

 
Property and Equipment:  Property and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated 
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset.  Leasehold 
improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their respective estimated 
useful lives. 

 
Certain property and equipment have been purchased with grant funds received from the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Such items or a portion thereof may be 
reclaimed by the federal government if not used to further the grant’s objectives. 
 
Donation of property and equipment are reported at fair value as a increase in unrestricted 
net assets unless use of the assets is restricted by the donor.  Monetary gifts that must be 
used to acquire property and equipment are reported as restricted support.  The expiration of 
such restrictions is reported as an increase in unrestricted net assets when the donated asset 
is placed in service. 
 
Long-Lived Asset Impairment:  The Organization evaluates the recoverability of the 
carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying 
amount may not be recoverable.  If a long-lived asset is tested for recoverability and the 
undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual 
disposition of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset cost is 
adjusted to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the 
carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value.  No asset impairment was 
recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 
Net Patient Service Revenue:  The Organization has agreements which third-party payers 
that provide for payments to the Organization at amounts different from its established rates 
(see Note 16).

December 31, 2018 and 2017 

 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Principles (Continued) 
 

Government Grant Revenue:  Support funded by grants is recognized as the Organization 
performs the contracted services or incurs outlays eligible for reimbursement under the 
grant agreements.  Grant activities and outlays are subject to audit and acceptance by 
granting agency, and as a result of such audit, adjustments could be required (see Note 4). 
 
Income Taxes:  East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. is a tax-exempt 
organization under IRS Code section 501 (c) (3) and is not considered to be a private 
foundation. East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. is exempt from federal taxes 
on income other than unrelated business income. East Central Oklahoma Family Health 
Center, Inc. did not have any net unrelated business income for the years ended December 
31, 2018 and 2017.  
 
Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions:  Management evaluated their tax position and 
concluded that they had taken no uncertain tax positions that require adjustment to the 
financial statements to comply with the provisions of this guidance.  With few exceptions, 
they are no longer subject to income tax examinations by the U.S. Federal, State or local tax 
authorities for years before the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 
Expense Allocation:  The costs of providing various programs and other activities have 
been summarized on a functional basis in the Statement of Activities and in the Statement 
of Functional Revenue and Expenses.  Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated 
among the programs and supporting services benefited. 

 
Federal and State Contracts:  The Organization receives funding through federal and state 
contracts.  Acceptance of these contacts requires compliance with contract conditions.  Any 
costs disallowed by the contracts must be paid by non-governmental funds. 
 

Note 3. Net Assets 
 
In accordance with FASB ASU 2016-14 net assets are presented in the following two 
components: 
 
Net Assets without Donor Restrictions 
 
The portion of the organization’s net assets that are not subject to donor-imposed 
restrictions. 
 
Net Assets with Donor Restrictions 
 
The portion of the organization’s net assets whose use by the organization has been limited 
by donors to a specific time period or purpose.  As of December 31, 2018, and 2017 the 
organization did not have any net assets with donor restrictions.

Note 3. Net Assets (Continued) 

 
Net Assets Released 
 
When a donor restriction expires, that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose 
restriction is accomplished, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets 
without donor restrictions and reported in the statement of activities as net assets released 
from restrictions or in appropriate expense category in the statement of activities and changes 
in net assets. 

 
 

Note 4. Grant Revenue 
 

The Organization is the recipient of a Consolidated Health Centers (“CHC”) grant from the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  The general purpose of the grant is to 
provide expanded health care service delivery for residents of Wetumka, Henryetta and 
Wewoka, Oklahoma, and the surrounding area.  Terms of the grant generally provide for 
funding of the Organization’s operations based on an approved budget.  Grant revenue is 
recognized as qualifying expenditures are incurred over the grant period.  The Organization 
recognized $3,631,723 and $3,247,468 in revenues from this grant for the years ended 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Organization’s present CHC grant award 
covers the grant year ending April 30, 2019 and is authorized for funding in the amount of 
$3,206,394. 
 

 
Note 5. Accounts Receivable - Patient 

2018 2017

Total Receivable-Patients 435,543$         195,823$         
Less Allowance for Uncollectable (213,515)          (74,549)            

Total 222,028$         121,274$         

 
The total for uncollectible accounts is based on management’s estimate of potential bad 
debts as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
 

Note 6. Service Contracts and Grants 
 

East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. derives a majority of its revenue from 
service contracts and grants from federal and state agencies. A significant reduction in the 
level of revenue from these agencies could have a material effect on the Organization’s 
programs, activities and operations.

EAST CENTRAL OKLAHOMA FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, INC. 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 

 
Note 7. Contingencies 

 
During the normal course of business, the Center is involved in various claims and lawsuits. 
In the opinion of management, the potential loss on any claim and lawsuit, net of insurance 
proceeds, will not be significant to the Center’s financial position or results of operations. 

 
Note 8. Concentration of Credit Risk 

 
The Center has locations in Wetumka, Henryetta and Wewoka, Oklahoma.  The Center 
grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are 
uninsured or under insured. 

 
Note 9. Charity Care and Other Community Benefits 

 
In addition to the services provided to the financially disadvantaged, the Center provides 
services to other individuals, various community agencies, and to the broader community.  
These services are provided at no charge to the public and include such items as health 
education and promotion, blood pressure and cholesterol screening, and health assessments. 
Costs related to these services are not separately identifiable. 

 
Note 10. Compensated Absences 

 
The Center accepts that it is necessary for staff members to have a means by which they are 
able to have compensated time away from work for personal reasons, including short-term, 
transitory illnesses. It is believed that a paid time off (PTO) approach to allocating and 
taking compensated time away is an effective approach to providing compensated time off 
for the Center’s staff members. In addition, it is believed that PTO is an effective tactic for 
managing staff member absences in a health service organization. 

 
PROCEDURE: 
 
A.  Annual leave is computed from an employee’s first day at work but cannot be taken 

during the introductory period for newly hired employees.  Annual leave does not 
accrue during periods of suspension, layoff, or leave of absence without pay. 

B.  Adjustment in Annual Leave is effective the first day of the month following the 
employee’s anniversary date. 

C.   For employees in high demand professions, e.g. physicians, (primary care), pharmacists, 
dentists, and others, the Chief Executive Officer has the authority to negotiate a 
separate Recruitment/Retention plan. The plan should not exceed the market within the 
surrounding area. 

D.   Annual leave earned during any calendar month shall be credited to the employee on 
the last day of the pay period.

Note 10. Compensated Absences (Continued) 

 
E.       Employees may not accumulate annual leave in excess of 240 hours. Annual leave 

in excess of 240 hours will not be credited to annual leave accumulation or 
payment. 

F.       Annual leave shall continue to accumulate at the normal rate during periods of 
authorized leave with pay. Annual Leave must be used in fifteen (15) minute 
increments. 

G.       Leave may be taken any time during the year, subject to the convenience of the 
Agency. Employees shall file a request with their supervisor at least two weeks 
prior to their desired leave date. 

H.       Employees, who have accumulated over eighty (80) hours of annual leave by May 
1, may elect to exercise one of the following options 

   1.  Retain annual leave up to maximum of 30 days (240 Hours) 
I.       Separation/Death 
   1.  Separation – An employee will be paid for annual leave at the                   

                       next regular pay period after the date of separation. 
   2.  Death – In case of the death of an employee, payment will be                    

                        delivered to the employee’s beneficiary, estate, or as otherwise              
                        provided. 

 
 
Note 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

 
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Center in estimating the fair 
value of its financial instruments at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying amounts 
reported in the balance sheet for cash, assets limited as to use, accounts payable and accrued 
expenses, approximate their fair value.

Totals 2,156,221$  1,576,038$  3,732,259$  
 

Note 15. Medical Malpractice Claims 
 

The U.S Department of Health and Human Services has deemed the Organization and its 
practicing providers covered under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for damage for 
personal injury, including death resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental 
and related functions.  FTCA coverage is comparable to an occurrence policy without a 
monetary cap.  The Organization has adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards 
Update (ASU) 2010-24, Health Care Entities (topic 954): Presentation of Insurance Claims 
and Related Insurance Recoveries, which eliminates the practice of netting claim liabilities 
with expected insurance recoveries for balance sheet presentation.  Claim liabilities are to 
be determined without consideration of insurance recoveries.  Expected recoveries are 
presented separately.  Prior to the adoption of ASU 2010-24, accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America required a health care provider to accrue 
only an estimate of the malpractice claims cost for both reported claims and claims incurred 
but not reported where the risk of a loss had not been transferred to a financially viable 
insurer.  There was no impact of ASU adoption to the Organization’s financial statements.

EAST CENTRAL OKLAHOMA FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, INC. 

Notes to the Financial Statements 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 

 
Note 15. Medical Malpractice Claims (Continued) 

 
Based upon the Organization’s claim experience, no accrual has been made for the 
Organization’s medical malpractice costs for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. 
However, because of the risk in providing health care services, it is possible that an event 
has occurred which will be the basis of a future material claim. 

 
Note 16. Net Patient Service Revenue 

 
The Organization is approved as a FQHC for both Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement 
purposes.  The Organization has agreements with third-party payers that provide for 
payments to the Organization at amounts different from its established rates. 
 
These payments arrangements include: 

 
Medicare – Covered FQHC services rendered to Medicare program beneficiaries 
are paid based on a prospective reimbursement methodology.  The Organization 
is reimbursed a set encounter rate for certain services provided.  Services not 
covered under the FQHC benefit are paid based on established fee schedules. 
 
Medicaid - Covered FQHC services rendered to Medicaid programs beneficiaries 
are paid based on a prospective reimbursement methodology.  The Organization 
is reimbursed a set encounter rate for certain services provided.  Services not 
covered under the FQHC benefit are paid based on established fee schedules. 

 
Approximately 53% and 48% of net patient service revenues are from participation in the 
Medicare and state-sponsored Medicaid programs for the years ended December 31, 2018 
and 2017, respectively.  Laws and regulations governing the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs are complex and subject to interpretation and change.  As a result, it is reasonably 
possible that recorded estimates will change materially in the near term. 

 
Patient service revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, for the years ended 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 

 
2018 2017

Total Patient Service Revenue 3,208,366$   3,148,290$   
Less:  Total Contractual, Sliding Fee and

Bad Debt Adjustment (959,516)       (859,841)       

Net Patient Service Revenue 2,248,850$   2,288,449$

Notes to the Financial Statements 
December 31, 2018 and 2017 

 
Note 16. Net Patient Service Revenue (continued) 

 
The Organization has also entered into payment agreement with certain commercial 
insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations.  
The basis for payment to the Organization under these agreements includes prospectively 
determined rates per unit of service and discounts from established charges. 

 
Note 17. Significant Estimates and Concentrations 
 

Accounting principles general accepted in the United States of America require disclosure 
of certain significant estimates and current vulnerability due to certain concentrations.  
Those maters include the following: 
 
Grant Revenues – Concentration of revenues related to grant awards and other support is 
described in Note 4. 
 
Allowance for Net Patient Service Revenue Adjustments – Estimates of allowances for 
adjustments included in net patient service revenue are described in Notes 2, 5, and 16. 
 
Malpractice Claims – Estimates related to the accrual for professional liability claims are 
described in Note 15. 
 
Current Economic Conditions – The current protracted economic decline continues to 
present community health centers with circumstances and challenges, which in some cases 
have resulted in declines in the fair value of investments and declines in contributions.  The 
financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to 
the Organization. 
Current economic conditions have made it difficult for certain of our patients to pay for 
services rendered.  As employers make adjustments to health insurance plans or more 
patients become unemployed, services provided to self-pay and other payers may 
significantly impact net patient service revenue, which could have an adverse impact on 
the Organization’s future operating results.  Further, the effect of economic conditions on 
the state may have an adverse effect on cash flows related to the Medicaid program. 
 
Given the volatility of current economic conditions, the values of assets and liabilities 
recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly and negatively impact the 
Organizations.

NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 

 
Note A – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

 
The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards includes the federal awards activity of the 
Organization and is presented on the accrual basis of accounting.  The information in this schedule 
is presented in accordance with the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.  Therefore, some 
amounts presented in the schedule may differ from amounts presented in, or used in the preparation 
of, the basic consolidated financial statement. 
 
The organization has elected not to use the 10-percent de minimis indirect cost rate as allowed 
under the Uniform Guidance. 
 

Note B – Consolidated Health Centers 
 
The Organization is the recipient of a Consolidated Health Centers (“CHC”) grant from the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services.  The general purpose of the grant is to provide 
expanded health care service delivery for residents of Wetumka, Henryetta and Wewoka, 
Oklahoma, and the surrounding area.  Terms of the grant generally provide for funding of the 
Organization’s operations based on an approval budget.  Grant revenue is recognized as qualifying

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  
FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND ON COMPLIANCE, AND OTHER MATTERS  

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
The Board of Directors 
East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. 
Wetumka, Oklahoma 
 
 
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States 
of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of East 
Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. (a nonprofit organization), which comprise the 
statement of financial position as of December 31, 2018, and the related statements of activities and 
changes in net assets, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial 
statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 29, 2019. 
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered East Central 
Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) to 
determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion 
on the effectiveness of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s internal control. 
Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of East Central Oklahoma Family 
Health Center, Inc.’s internal control.  
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, 
or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a 
material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit 
attention by those charged with governance.  
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of 
this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material 
weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether East Central Oklahoma Family Health 
Center Inc.’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, 
noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial 
statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an 
objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests 
disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under 
Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed 
in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the organization’s internal control 
and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR 

EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  
COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

 
The Board of Directors 
East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. 
Wetumka, Oklahoma 
 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s compliance with the types of 
compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and 
material effect on each of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s major federal programs 
for the year ended December 31, 2018. East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s major 
federal programs are identified in the summary of auditors’ results section of the accompanying 
schedule of findings and questioned costs.  
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs.  
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of East Central Oklahoma Family 
Health Center, Inc.’s major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial 
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform 
Guidance).  Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about East Central 
Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s compliance with those requirements and performing such 
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of East Central 
Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s compliance.  
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center Inc. complied, in all material respects, 
with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material 
effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
 
Management of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc. is responsible for establishing 
and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered 
East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, Inc.’s internal control over compliance with the types 
of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we 
do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of East Central Oklahoma Family Health Center, 
Inc.’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the 
first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control 
over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify 
any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements 
of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
