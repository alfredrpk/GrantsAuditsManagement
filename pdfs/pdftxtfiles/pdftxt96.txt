INDEPEN DENT AUDITOR'S REPORÏ

The Honorable Board of Education
Fairview School District #l-84
Major County, Oklahoma

I have audited the accompanying combined fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory
basis of the Fairview School District #l-84, Major County, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30,
2018, as listed in the table of contents.

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in
accordance with the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State
Department of Education as describeC in Note 1, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the State of
Oklahoma; this includes determining that the regulatory basis of accounting is an acceptable basis for the
preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances. Management is also responsible for the design,
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my
audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. ln making
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal
control. Accordingly, I express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of
accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit
opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the financial reporting requirements of the
Oklahoma State Department of Education, the financial statements are prepared by Fairview School District
#l-84, Major County, Oklahoma on the basis of the financial reporting regulations prescribed or permitted by
the Oklahoma State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America,

PAGE 4



lndependent Auditor's Report
Fairview School District #l-84
Page 2

The effects on the financial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of accounting described
in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, although not
reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material.

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
ln my opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S.
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles paragraph the financial statements referred to in the first paragraph
do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2018, or the revenues, expenses, and changes in
net position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended.

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accountíng
The financial statements referred to above do not include the general fixed asset account group, which is a
departure from the regulatory basis of accounting prescribed or permitted by the Oklahoma State Department
of Education noted above. The amount that should be recorded in the general fixed asset account group is
not known.

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting
ln my opinion, except for the effects of the matter described in the "Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory
Basis of Accounting" the combined financial statements referred to in the first paragraph present fairly, in all
material respects, the assets, liabilities and fund balances arising from regulatory basis transactions of each
fund type and account group of the Fairview School District #l-84, Major County, Oklahoma, as of June 30,
2018, and the revenues collected and expenditures paid and encumbered for the year then ended, on the
regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Matters

Other lnformation

My audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the fund type and account group financial
statements-regulatory basis within the combined financial statements. The combining fund statements-
regulatory basis and other schedules as listed in the table of contents, under other supplementary
information, are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the combined
financial statements-regulatory basis of the District. Also, the accompanying schedule of expenditures of
federal awards is presented for additional analysis as required by Title 2 IJS Code of Federal Regulation
(CFR) Parf 200, Uniform Administration Requiremenfs, Cosf Principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal
Awards, (Ïhe Uniform Guidance), and is also not a required part of the financialstatements.

The combining statements-regulatory basis, and the other supplementary information, including the schedule
of expenditures of federal awards, are the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate
directly to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the combined financial statements-regulatory
basis. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type
and account group financial statements within the combined financial statements-regulatory basis and eeftain
additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying
accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America ln my opinion, the combining statements-regulatory basis, and the other
supplementary information, including the schedule of expenditures, of federal awards, are fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the combined financial statements-regulatory basis taken as a whole on the
regulatory basis of accounting described in Note 1.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
ln accordance with Government Auditing Standards, I have also issued my report dated March 4,2019, on
my consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on my tests of its compliance
with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of
that report is to describe the scope of my testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the internal control over financial reporting or
on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing
Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

Sincerely,

has Carroll, P.A.

FAIRVIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT #I-84
MAJOR COUNTY - OKLAHOMA
JULY ,1 ,2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Siqnificant Accountinq Policies
The financial statements of the Fairview School District #l-84 have been prepared in conformity with other an
comprehensive basis of accounting required by Oklahoma Statutes. The more significant of the District's
accounting policies are described below.

A. Reportinq Entity
The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes and
accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial reporting purposes. The District is part of the
public school system of Oklahoma under the general direction and control of the State Board of Education
and is financially dependent on state of Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public
school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes.

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of elected members. The appointed
superintendent is the executive officer of the District.

ln evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management has considered all
potential component units. The decision to include a potential component unit in the reporting entity was
made by applying the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The
basic - but not the only - criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the
governing body's oversight responsibility, especially financial interdependency. A second criterion used in
evaluating potential component units is the scope of public service. A third criterion used to evaluate potential
component units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special financing
relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight responsibilities. Based upon the
application of these criteria, there are no potentialcomponent units included in the District's reporting entity.

B. Fund Accounting
The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the results of its operations.
Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance and to aid financial management by
segregating transactions related to certain district functions or activities.

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account group, on the other
hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are
not recorded in the funds because they do not directly affect net expendable available financial resources.

Funds are classified into two categories; governmental and fiduciary. Each category, in turn, is divided into
separate "fund types".

Fund D ption
The following funds are utilized by the Fairview School District #l-84

Governmental Fund Types - Fiduciary Fund Types -
General Fund
Special Revenue Funds
Debt Service Fund
Capital Project Funds

Agency Fund

Governmental Fund Types -
Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general activities, including the
collection and disbursement of earmarked monies (special revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of
general fixed assets (capital projects funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds).

MAJOR COUNTY - OKLAHOMA

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE 2

B. Fund Accounting

General Fund - The General Fund is used to account for all financial transactions except those required to be
accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state and local property taxes and state
funding under the Foundation and lncentive Aid Program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the
daily operations of the schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school
construction and debt services on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund includes federal and
state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs which includes the Child Nutrition
Program.

Special Revenue Funds - Special Revenue Funds are the District's Building Fund, Child Nutrition Fund, and
Co-op Fund. The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property taxes levied for the purpose of
erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for purchasing furniture and equipment. The Child Nutrition
Fund derives monies from the sale of foods and federal and state program reimbursements. Expenditures
include costs associated with the daily operations of the district's nutrition program. The Co-op Fund consists
of monies generated by two or more school districts (may include other entities) that have entered into a
cooperative agreement to maintain joint programs. The monies may consist of federal, state, and local
sources including the individual contributions of participating school districts.

Debt Service Fund - The Debt Service Fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to account for the
accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term debt principal, interest and related
costs. The primary revenue sources are local property taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest
earnings from temporary investments.

Capital Project Funds - The Capital Project Funds are the District's Bond Funds and are used to account for
the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school sites, constructing and equipping new
school facilities, renovating existing facilities and acquiring transportation equipment.

Fiduciarv Fund Tvpes- Fiduciary Funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties,
including other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. When these assets are held
under the terms of a formal trust agreement, either a nonexpendable trust fund or an expendable trust fund is
used. The terms "nonexpendable" and "expendable" refer to whether or not the District is under an obligation
to maintain the trust principal. Agency funds generally are used to account for assets that the District holds
on behalf of others as their agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations.

Aqency Fund - The Agency Fund is the school Activity Fund which is used to account for monies collected
principally through fundraising efforts of the students and District-sponsored groups. The administration is
responsible, under the authority of the Board, of collecting, disbursing and accounting for these activity funds.
The school Activity Funds can include money which is received from the sale of foods through a school Lunch
Fund.

Memorandum Only - Total Column
The total column on the general purpose financial statements is captioned "memorandum only" to indicate
that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not present financial position,
results of operations or cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. Neither is
such data comparable to a consolidation. lnterfund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of
this data.

C. Basis of Accountinq and Presentation
The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by the Oklahoma
State Department of Education (OSDE). This format is essentially the generally accepted form of
presentation used by State and local governments prior to the effective date of GASB Statement No. 34,
Basic Financial Statements-Management's Discussion and Analysis-for State and Local Governments. This
format significantly differs from that required by GASB 34.

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and disbursements
modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as follows:

* Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts, and other
commitments for the expenditure of monies and are recorded as
expenditures when approved.* lnvestments and inventories are recorded as assets when purchased

" Capital assets in proprietary funds are recorded when acquired and
depreciated over their useful lives.* Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued.* Long{erm debt is recorded when incurred.* Accrued compensated absences are recorded as an expenditure and
liability when the obligation is incurred.

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America, which requires revenues to be recognized when they become available and measurable, or when
they are earned, and expenditures or expenses to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for
governmental fund types; and, when revenues are earned and liabilities are incurred for proprietary fund
types and trust funds.

D. Budqets and Budqetarv Accountinq
The Distrlct is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget must be submitted to
the Board of Education by December 3l for the fiscal year beginning the following July '1. lf the preliminary
budget requires an additional levy, the District must hold an election on the first Tuesday in February to
approve the levy. lf the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. lf
an election is held and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the legal budget. lf
voters reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within the approved tax rate.

A budget is legally adopted by the Board of Education for the General Fund, Special Revenue Funds and
Capital Project Funds that includes revenues and expenditures.

Encumbrances represent commitments related to unperformed contracts for goods or services.
Encumbrance accounting--under which purchase orders and other commitments of resources are recorded
as expenditures of the applicable fund - is utilized in all governmental funds of the District.

The unencumbered balance of current fiscal year appropriations and the unexpended reserve appropriations
of the previous fiscal year are lapsed and become a part of the beginning fund balance for the succeeding
fiscal year.

E. Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the regulatory basis of accounting requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ from
those estimates.

F. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equitv

Cash, Cash Equivalents and lnvestments
All monies which are not invested in Certificate of Deposits or United States Treasury Funds are maintained
in NOW Checking Accounts or Savings Accounts.

lnventories
The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the financial statements.

Fixed Assets and Propertv. Plant and Equipment
Property and equipment purchases are recorded as capital outlays in the accompanying statements of
revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances. The District does not maintain complete financial
records of capital assets purchased which would include depreciation schedules; therefore, a General Fixed
Asset Group of Accounts is not presented.

Compensated Absences
The District has elected not to present a liability for compensated absences.

Operating Leases
The District has elected not to present a liability for operating leases. All operating leases contain a mutual
ratification clause for both parties; therefore, the District does not consider the obligation to be for a period
extending beyond the current fiscal year.

Lonq Term Debt
Long{erm debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund when due, or when resources have been
accumulated in the debt service fund for payment early in the following year. For other long{erm obligations,
only that portion expected to be financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund
liability of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the general long-term
debt account group. Longterm liabilities expected to be financed from proprietary fund operations are
accounted for in those funds.

General Lonq-Term Debt
State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the revenue to be
received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond issues have been approved by the
voters and issued by the District for various capital improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid
serially within 25 years from the date of issue. General long{erm debt of the District consists of bonds
payable. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and future revenues of
the debt service fund.

A principal and interest repayment schedule of the outstanding general obligation bond issues at June 30,
2018 is set forth below:

G. Revenue, Expenses and Expenditures

State Revenues
Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily governed by the state aid formula under the
provisions of Article XVlll, Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the
allocation of state aid funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts.

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State Department of Education may
adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally, such
adjustments are treated as reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustment is made.

The District receives revenue from the state to administer certain categorical educational programs. State
Board of Education rules require that revenue ear-marked for these programs be expended only for the
program for which the money is provided and require that the money not expended as of the close of the
fiscal year be carried forward into the following year to be expended for the same categorical program. The
State Department of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in
the general fund.

Property Tax Revenue
The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes which consists of ad valorem taxes on real and
personal property within the District. The County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from
the county excise board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the county treasurer prior to
October 1. The county treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of receipt of the tax rolls.
The first half of the taxes are due prior to January 1. The second half is due prior to April 1.

PAGE 13



FAIRVIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT #I-84
MAJOR COUNTY _ OKLAHOMA
JULY 1,2017 TO JUNE 30, 2018

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PAGE B

Propertv Tax Revenue
lf the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on January 2. Second half
taxes become delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year of assessment. lf not paid by the following
October 1, the property is offered for sale for the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem
the property by paying the taxes and penalty owed. lf at the end of two years the owner has not done so, the
purchaser is issued a deed to the property.

I nter-fu nd Transactions
Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, expenditures, or expenses. Transactions that
constitute reimbursement to a fund for expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly
applicable to another fund, are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. Any legally
authorized transfers are treated as operating transfers and are included in the results of the Government
Funds. Transfers between the Agency Funds (Activity Funds) and the Governmental Fund Types (General
Fund) are shown as operating transfers into the Governmental Fund Types (General Fund) only. No transfer
is shown out from the Agency Funds as they are custodial in nature (assets equal liabilities) and do not
involve measurement of results of operations.

2. Risk Manaqement

Liabilities Protection Plan
The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts, theft of, damage to and destruction of assets;
errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The District purchases commercial insurance to
cover these risks, including general and auto liability, property damage, and public officials liability. Settled
claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage in any of the past
three fiscal years.

The School also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in which there is a transfer or
pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. ln accordance with professional standards, the School
reports the required contribution to the pool, net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the
Oklahoma School Assurance group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers'
compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma. ln that capacity, OSAG is
responsible for providing loss control services and certain fiscal activities, including obtaining contract
arrangements for the underwriting, excess insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for
any and all claims submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG, the District is required to
pay fees set by OSAG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees paid by the
District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is calculated by projecting losses based
on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG provides coverage in excess of the Loss Fund so the
District's liability for claim loss is limited to the balance of the loss fund. lf the District does not use their loss
fund in three years, it is returned to them with no interest.

The Distriet is also a member of the Oklahoma Public School Unemployment Compensation Program. ln this
program, the District is required to make a deposit based on past experience for potential unemployment
claims. The funds for each District are kept separate. The money contributed by each District does not earn
interest and is fully insured. lf the District has claims in excess of the amount of their account, they would be
liable for the excess.

Surety Bonds
Denise Martin, District Treasurer, is bonded with the Western Surety Company in the amount of $100,000.00.
The bond number is61725187, dated July l, 2017 to July 1,2018.

The Superintendent is bonded with the Western Surety Company in the amount of $100,000.00. The bond

3. Emplovee Retirement System

The District participates in the state-administered Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System (the "System"),
which is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer public employee retirement system (PERS). Under the System,
contributions are made by the District, the State of Oklahoma, and the participating employees. Participation
is required for all teachers and other certified employees and is optional for all other regular employees of
public educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. A participant's date of membership is the
date the first contribution is made to the System. The System is administered by a board of trustees which
acts as a fiduciary for investing the funds and governing the administration of the System. The District has no
responsibility or authority for the operation and administration of the System nor has it any liability, except for
the current contribution requirements.

A Participant with 5 years of creditable service may retire with a normal retirement allowance at the age of
sixty-two or with reduced benefits as early as age fifty-five. The normal retirement allowance paid monthly for
life and then to beneficiaries, if certain options are exercised, equals two percent of the average of the highest
three earning years of contributory service multiplied by the number of years of credited service. A participant
leaving employment before attaining retirement age, but completing ten years of service, may elect to vest his
accumulated contributions and defer receipt of a retirement annuity until a later date. When a participant dies
in active service and has completed ten years of credited service, the beneficiary is entitled to a death benefit
of $18,000.00, and the surviving spouse may, in lieu of the death benefit, elect to receive, subject to the
surviving spousal options, the participant's retirement benefits accrued at the time of death.

The contribution rates for the Districts and its employees, which are not actuarially determined, are
established by statute and applied to the employee's earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits. The District
is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable compensation for the year ended June 30, 2018. An
additional 7.80o/o of compensation is required for federal grants. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma
Teacher's Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating members. The
required contribution for participating member is 7o/o up to a maximum compensation level.

The total contributions for employees of Fairview School District #l-84 covered by the System for the year
2018,2017 and 2016 were $555,723.31, $547,943.52 and $579,108.52, respectively.

The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure measure of the present value of pension benefits.
This pension valuation method reflects the present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in the
future years as a result of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected
salary increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts.

The Oklahoma Teacher Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial
statements and required supplementary information for the System. The system issues an independent
financial report, financial statements and required supplementary information that may be obtained by writing
to the Oklahoma Teacher's Retirement System, P.O. Box 53624, Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling 405-
521-2387.

FAIRVIEW SCHOOL DISTRICT #I-84
MAJOR COUNTY - OKLAHOMA
SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS
ALLOCATIONS & EXPENDITURES
07101t17 TO 06/30/18

The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards was prepared using the same accounting policies used in preparing the District,s
financial statements. The District's policy is to recognize expenditures when encumbered (contracted for) rather than at the t¡me
the related fund liability is incurred.

The District policy is to expend Child Nutrition federal, state and local revenues, in that order, during each fiscal year. lf there are any
unexpended federal or state funds remaining at the end of a fiscal year, those funds will be expended during the next fiscal year, prior to
the utilization of current year funding.

The amount shown as received and expended in the Child Nutrition Cluster for commodities represents a nonmonetary value of the
food commodities received. Therefore, the total revenues and expenditures do not agree with the financial statements by this amount.

lndirect Cost included ¡n total expenditures.

The District has elected not to use the 1o% de Minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS

BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOYERNMENT AUDITING SIANDARDS

The Honorable Board of Education
Fairview School District #l-84
Major County, Oklahoma

I have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and
the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying fund type and account group financial
statements-regulatory basis of the Fairview School District #l-84, Major County, Oklahoma, as listed in the
Table of Contents , as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial
statements, which collectively comprise the District's financial statements, and have issued my report thereon
dated March 4, 2019, which was adverse with respect to the presentation of the financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States because the presentation
followed the regulatory basis of accounting for Oklahoma school districts and did not conform to the
presentation requirements of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. However, my report was
qualified for the omission for general fixed asset account groups with respect to the presentation of financial
statements on the regulatory basis of accounting authorized by the Oklahoma State Board of Education.

lnternal Control Over Financial Reporting
ln planning and performing my audit of the financial statements, I considered the District's internal control
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances for the purpose of expressing my opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control. Accordingly, I do not express
an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in
internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the District's
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a
materialweakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

My consideration of internal controi was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section
and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or
significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses may or significant deficiencies may exist that were
not identified. Given these limitations, during my audit I did not identify any deficiencies in internal control
that I consider to be material weaknesses However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been
identified. I did identify certain deficiencies in internal control, described in the accompanying Schedule of
Findings and Questioned Costs as item 1B-01 that lconsiderto be a significantdeficiency.

Gompliance and Other Matters
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District's financial statements are free of
material misstatement, I performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the
determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those
provisions was not an objective of my audit and accordingly, I do not express such an opinion. The results of
my tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under
G ove rn me n t Au d iti n g Sfandards.

Response to Findings
The District's response to the findings identified in my audit is described in the accompanying school's
corrective action plan. The District's response was not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the
audit of the financial statements and, accordingly I express no opinion on it.

Purpose of this Report
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of my testing of internal control and compliance and
the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's control or on
compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing
Sfandards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not
suitable for any other purpose.

Sincerely,

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

The Honorable Board of Education
Fairview School District #l-84
Major County, Oklahoma

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program
I have audited the Fairview School District #l-84, Major County, Oklahoma compliance with the types of
compliance requirements of lrTle 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative
Requiremenfs, Cosf Principals, ad Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) that could
have a direct and material effect on each of Fairview School District #l-84's major federal programs for the
year ended June 30, 2018. The District's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's
results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

Management's Responsibility
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts and grants
applicable to its federal programs.

Auditor's Responsibility
My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the District's major federal programs
based on my audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. I conducted my audit of
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Sfandards, issued by the
Comptroller General of the United States, and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Pañ 200, Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principals, ad Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform
Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that I plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to
above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program occurred. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence about the District's compliance with those requirements and performing
such other procedures as I considered necessary in the circumstances.

I believe that my audit provides a reasonable basis for my opinion on compliance with each major federal
program. However, my audit does not provide a legal determination of the District's compliance.

Opinion on Each Major Federal Program
ln my opinion, Fairview School District #l-84 complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal
programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.

Report on lnternal Gontrol Over Compliance
Management of the District is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
compliance with the types of compliance referred to above. ln planning and performing my audit of
compliance, I considered the District's internal control over compliance with the types of requirements that
could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the auditing procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on compliance for each
major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the
Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control
over compliance. Accordingly, I do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal
control over compliance.

Compliance/l nternal Control Report ( Federal)
Fairview School District #l-84
Page Two

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent or detect and correct noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that
material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented or
detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance
requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over
compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

My consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance
that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. I did not identify any deficiencies in internal
control over compliance that I consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist
that have not been identified.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of my testing of
internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform
Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

Sincerely,

DISPOSITION OF PRIOR YEAR FINDINGS
JUNE 30, 2018

17-01 Finding

Statement of Condition- Pre-numbered Admission Tickets for School Sponsored Events were not utilized.

Criteria- Pre-numbered admission tickets should be used for admissions in order to establish internal control.
All tickets not sold by the gate keepe(s) should be accounted for at the end of each event and a written
reconciliation made of tickets sold to actual revenues collected and verified by two (2) counting individual's
signatures. Reconciliation documents along with the unseparated side of the used admission tickets should
be placed in a container and presented to the Activity Fund Custodian.

Cause/Effect of Conditions- Not utilizing or retaining admission tickets could lead to loss of revenues and
provides no documentation of actual collections for events.

Recommendations- The District should utilize admission tickets at all School Sponsored Events. The ticket
sales reconciliation forms are to be retained along with the string of duplicate side sold tickets. The tickets
may be destroyed after that fiscal years audit is complete.

Current Status- This finding was corrected during the current year.

17-02 Finding

Statement of Condition- Verification of cash counts were not made by the Activity Fund Custodian.

Criteria- Admissions to School Sponsored Events are to be reconciled by at least two assigned employees.
Each employee shall sign the reconciliation (cash count) form and attest to its accuracy. The collection should
be taken to a night depository or another secure facility. The Activity Fund Custodian should retrieve the
collections (bank bag) and confirm the accuracy of the reconciliation (cash count) and provide explanation of
any discrepancies and then make the deposit.

Cause/Effect of Conditions- Not performing a second verification cash count by the Official Fund Custodian
could lead to loss of revenues or unexplained discrepancies in the funds general ledger and sub-accounts.

Recommendations- The District should initiate the reconciliation process and begin the second cash count in
order to provide a more accountable record maintenance.

Current Status- This finding was corrected during the current year.
