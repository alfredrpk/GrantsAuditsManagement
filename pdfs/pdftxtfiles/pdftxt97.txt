INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 

To the Honorable Board of Education 
Carnegie Independent School District No. 33 
Carnegie, Caddo County, Oklahoma 

Report on the Financial Statements 

204 E. FRANKLIN - P.O. BOX 507 
WEATHERFORD, OK 73096 

580-772-3596 
FAX 580-772-3085 

We have audited the accompanying fund type and account group financial statements-regulatory 
basis of Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended 
June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise 
Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's basic financial statements as listed in 
the table of contents. 

Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements 
in accordance with the · financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education as described in Note 1. Management is also responsible for the design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable . to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing . Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the· United States. Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement. 

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fmancial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor 
considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial

MEMBER OF OKLAHOMA SOCIETY Of CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 



statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not 
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. 
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our modified audit opinions. 

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

As described in Note 1, the fmancial statements are prepared by Carnegie Independent School 
District No. 33, Oklahoma, on the basis of the financial reporting provisions of the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education, which is a basis of accounting other than accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America, to meet the requirements of the Oklahoma 
State Department of Education. 

The effects on the fmancial statements of the variances between the regulatory basis of 
accounting described in Note 1 and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America, although not reasonably determinable, are presumed to be material. 

Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 

In our opinion, because of the significance of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Adverse 
Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles" paragraph, the :finand.al statements 
referred to above do not present fairly, in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, the :financial position of Carnegie Independent School 
District No. 33, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, or changes in :financial position for the year then 
ended. · 

Basis for Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

As discussed in Note 1, the fmancial statements referred to above do not include the General 
Fixed Asset Account Group, which is a departure from the regulatory basis of accounting 
prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The amount that should be 
recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group is not known. 

Qualified Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting 

. However, in our opinion, except for the effects of the matter discussed in the "Basis for Qualified 
Opinion on Regulatory Basis of Accounting" paragraph, the fmancial statements referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the cash and unencumbered cash balances arising 
from regulatory basis transactions of each fund type and account group of Carnegie Independent 
School District No. 33, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the revenues it received and 
expenditures it paid and encumbered for the year then ended, in accordance with the fmancial 
reporting provisions of the Oklahoma State Department of Education as described in Note 1.

Other Matters 

Other Information 

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the fund type and account 
group fmancial statements that collectively comprise Carnegie Independent School District No. 
33, Oklahoma's basic financial statements. The Combining Financial Statements are presented 
for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic fmancial statements. 
The Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis 
as required by Title 2 US. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative 
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is also not a 
required part of the basic fmancial statements. 

The Combining Financial Statements and the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards are 
the responsibility of management and were derived from and relate directly to the underlying 
accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information 
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the fund type and account 
group :financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and 
reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records- used to 
prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statement$ themselves, and other 
additional procedures in accordance . with auditing standards generally accepted in ·the United 
States of America. In our opinion, except for the financial statements being prepared in 
compliance with the regulatory basis as. prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of 
Education as discussed in Note 1, the Combining Financial Statements and the Schedule of 
Expenditures of Federal A wards are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic 
financial statements as a whole. 

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated 
February 18, 2019, on our consideration of Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, 
Oklahoma's, internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with 
certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The 
purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial 
reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal 
control over fmancial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit 
performed in accordance .with Government Auditing Standards in considering Carnegie 
Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's internal control over :financial reporting and 
compliance.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

OF 

CARNEGIE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 33 
CADDO COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 



1. 

CARNEGIE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT NO. 33 
CADDO COUNTY, OKLAHOMA 

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

The basic financial statements of the Carnegie Independent School District No. 33 (the 
"District") have been prepared in conformity with another comprehensive basis of 
accounting as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The more 
significant of the District's accounting policies are described below. 

A. Reporting Entity 

The District is a corporate body for public purposes created under Title 70 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes and accordingly is a separate entity for operating and financial 
reporting purposes. The District is part of the public school system of Oklahoma under 
the general direction and control of the State Board of Education and is financially 
dependent on State of Oklahoma support. The general operating authority for the public 
school system is the Oklahoma School Code contained in Title 70, Oklahoma Statutes. 

The governing body of the District is the Board of Education composed of five elected 
members. The appointed superintendent is the executive officer of the District. 

In evaluating how to define the District, for financial reporting purposes, management 
has considered all potential component units. The decision to include a potential 
component unit in the reporting entity was made by applying the criteria established by 
the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). The basic -- but not the only --
criterion for including a potential component unit within the reporting entity is the 
governing body's ability to exercise oversight responsibility. The most significant 
manifestation of this ability is financial interdependency. Other manifestations of the 
ability to exercise oversight responsibility include, but are not limited to, the selection of 
governing authority, the designation of management, the ability to significantly influence 
operations, and accountability for fiscal matters. A second criterion used in evaluating 
potential component units is the scope of public service. Application of this criterion 
involves considering whether the activity benefits the District and/or its citizens, or 
whether the activity is conducted within the geographic boundaries of the District and is 
generally available to its patrons. A third criterion used to evaluate potential component 
units for inclusion or exclusion from the reporting entity is the existence of special 
financing relationships, regardless of whether the District is able to exercise oversight 
responsibilities. Based upon the application of these criteria, there are no potential 
component units included in the District's reporting entity.

Reporting Entity, (Continued) 

The School Education Foundation is not included in the reporting entity. The District 
does not appoint any of the board members or exercise any oversight authority over the 
Foundation. 

B. Fund Accounting 

The District uses funds and account groups to report on its financial position and the 
results of its operations. Fund accounting is designed to demonstrate legal compliance 
and to aid financial management by segregating transactions related to certain district 
functions or activities. 

A fund is a separate accounting entity with a self-balancing set of accounts. An account 
group, on the other hand, is a financial reporting device designed to provide 
accountability for certain assets and liabilities that are not recorded in the funds because 
they do not directly affect net expendable available financial resources. 

Funds are classified into three categories: governmental, proprietary and fiduciary. Each 
category, in turn, is divided into separate "fund types." 

Governmental Fund Types 

Governmental funds are used to account for all or most of a government's general 
activities, including the collection and disbursement of earmarked · monies ( special 
revenue funds), the acquisition or construction of general fixed assets (capital projects 
funds), and the servicing of general long-term debt (debt service funds). 

General Fund - The general fund is used to account for all financial transactions except 
those required to be accounted for in another fund. Major revenue sources include state 
and local property taxes and state funding under the Foundation and Incentive Aid 
Program. Expenditures include all costs associated with the daily operations of the 
schools except for programs funded for building repairs and maintenance, school 
construction and debt service on bonds and other long-term debt. The general fund 
includes federal and state restricted monies that must be expended for specific programs.

Fund Accounting, (Continued) 

Special Revenue Fund - The special revenue funds of the District consist of the Building 
Fund, Child Nutrition Fund and the Gift and Endowment Fund. 

Building Fund - The Building Fund consists of monies derived from property 
taxes levied for the purpose of erecting, remodeling, or repairing buildings and for 
purchasing :furniture and equipment. 

Child Nutrition Fund - The Child Nutrition Fund consists of monies collected 
from meals served to students and employees of the district and is expended on 
food, supplies and salaries. The district also deposits monies received from the 
National School Lunch and Breakfast programs into this fund. 

Gift and Endowment Fund - The Gift and Endowment Fund receives it assets by 
way of foundations, individuals, or private organizations for which no repayment 
or special service to the contributor is expected. This fund is used to promote the 
general welfare of the District. 

Debt Service Fund - The Debt Service Fund is the District's Sinking Fund and is used to 
account for the accumulation of financial resources for the payment of general long-term 
debt principal, interest and related costs. The primary revenue sources are local property 
taxes levied specifically for debt service and interest earnings from temporary 
investments. 

Capital Projects Fund - The Capital Projects Fund is the District's Bond Funds and is 
used to account for the proceeds of bond sales to be used exclusively for acquiring school 
sites, constructing and equipping new school facilities, renovating existing facilities, and 
acquiring transportation equipment.

Fund Accounting, {Continued) 

Fiduciary Fund Types 

Fiduciary funds are used to account for assets held on behalf of outside parties, including 
other governments, or on behalf of other funds within the District. Agency funds 
generally are used to account for assets that the District holds on behalf of others as their 
agent and do not involve measurement of results of operations. 

Agency Fund - The Agency Fund is the School Activities Fund which is used to 
account for monies collected principally through fundraising efforts of the 
students and District-sponsored groups. The administration is responsible, under 
the authority of the Board, for collecting, disbursing and accounting for these 
activity funds. 

Account Groups 

Account groups are not funds and consist of a self-balancing set of accounts used only to 
establish accounting control over long-term debt and general fixed assets not accounted 
for in proprietary funds. 

General Long-Term Debt Account Group -This account group was established 
to account for all long-term debt of the District, which is offset by the amount 
available in the debt service fund and the amount to be provided in future years to 
complete retirement of the debt principal. It is also used to account for liabilities 
for compensated absences and early retirement incentives which are to be paid 
from funds provided in future years. 

General Fixed Asset Account Group - This account group is used to account for 
property, plant and equipment of the school district. The District has not 
maintained the cost of fixed assets purchased in previous years. Thus the General 
Fixed Asset Account Group is not presented. 

Memorandum Only - Total Column 

The total column on the financial statements is captioned "memorandum only'' to indicate 
that it is presented only to facilitate financial analysis. Data in this column does not 
present financial position, results of operations or cash flows in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. Neither is such data comparable to a 
consolidation. Interfund eliminations have not been made in the aggregation of this data.

C. Basis of Accounting and Presentation 

The District prepares its financial statements in a presentation format that is prescribed by 
the Oklahoma State Department of Education. This format is essentially the generally 
accepted form of presentation used by state and local governments prior to the effective 
date of GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements - Management's Discussion 
and Analysis - for State and Local Governments. This format differs significantly from 
that required by GASB 34. 

The basic financial statements are essentially prepared on a basis of cash receipts and 
disbursements modified as required by the regulations of the Oklahoma State Department 
of Education as follows: 

• Encumbrances represented by purchase orders, contracts and other commitments for 
the expenditure of monies are recorded as expenditures when approved. 
• Investments are recorded as assets when purchased. 
• School supplies are recorded as expenditures and not as inventory assets. 
•Warrants payable are recorded as liabilities when issued. 
•Long-term debt is recorded in the General Long-Term Debt Account Group and not 
in the basic financial statements. 
•Compensated absences are recorded as expenditures when paid and not recorded as a 
liability. 
• Fixed assets are recorded in the General Fixed Asset Account Group and not in the 
basic financial statements. Fixed assets are not depreciated. 

This regulatory basis of accounting differs from accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America, which require revenues to be recognized when they 
become available and measurable, or when they are earned, and expenditures or expenses . 
to be recognized when the related liabilities are incurred for governmental fund types. 

D. Budgets and Budgetary Accounting 

The District is required by state law to prepare an annual budget. A preliminary budget 
must be submitted to the Board of Education by December 31 for the fiscal year 
beginning the following July 1. If the preliminary budget requires an additional levy, the 
District must hold an election on the second Tuesday in February to approve the levy. If 
the preliminary budget does not require an additional levy, it becomes the legal budget. 
If an election is held and the taxes are approved, then the preliminary budget becomes the 
legal budget. If voters reject the additional taxes, the District must adopt a budget within 
the approved tax rate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (Continued) 

Budgets and Budgetary Accounting, (Continued) 

The District may upon approval by a majority of the electors of the District voting on the 
question make the ad valorem levy for emergency levy and local support levy permanent. 

Under current Oklahoma Statutes, a formal budget is required for all funds except for 
trust and agency funds. Budgets are presented for all funds that include the originally 
approved budgeted appropriations for expenditures and final budgeted appropriations as 
adjusted for supplemental appropriations and approved transfers between budget 
categories. 

E. Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity 

Cash and Cash Equivalents - For the statement of cash flows, the District considers all 
cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments, with an original maturity 
of three months or less when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Investments - Investments consist of direct obligations of the United States Government 
and Agencies or certificates of deposit with maturities greater than three months when 
purchased. All investments are recorded at cost, which approximates market value. 

Property Tax Revenues - The District is authorized by state law to levy property taxes 
which consist of ad valorem taxes on real and personal property within the District. The 
County Assessor, upon receipt of the certification of tax levies from the County Excise 
Board, extends the tax levies on the tax roll for submission to the County Treasurer prior 
to October 1. The County Treasurer must commence tax collection within fifteen days of 
receipt of the tax rolls. The first half of taxes is due prior to January 1. The second half 
is due prior to April 1. 

If the first payment is not made timely, the entire tax becomes due and payable on 
January 2. Second half taxes become 'delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year 
of assessment. If not paid by the following October 1, the property is offered for sale for 
the amount of taxes due. The owner has two years to redeem the property by paying the 
taxes and penalty owed. If, at the end of two years, the owner has not done so, the 
purchaser is issued a deed to the property 

Inventories - The value of consumable inventories at June 30, 2018 is not material to the 
financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, {Continued) 

Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity, {Continued) 

Fixed Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment - The General Fixed Asset Account 
Group is not presented. 

Compensated Absences - The District provides vacation and sick leave benefits in 
accordance with Title 70 of the Oklahoma Statutes, Article 6-104, which provides for 
annual sick leave and personal business days. None of the benefits are payable upon 
retirement or death. Accrued vacation and sick leave benefits are not reflected in the 
financial statements because such statements are prepared on the regulatory basis of 
accounting. This practice differs from generally accepted accounting principles. 

Long-Term Debt - Long-term debt is recognized as a liability of a governmental fund 
when due or when resources have been accumulated in the debt service fund for payment 
early in the following year. For other long-term obligations, only that portion expected to 
be financed from expendable available financial resources is reported as a fund liability 
of a governmental fund. The remaining portion of such obligations is reported in the 
general long-term debt account group. 

Fund Balance - In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report the 
hierarchy of fund balances. The hierarchy is based primarily on the degree of spending 
constraints placed upon use of resources for specific purposes versus availability of 
appropriation. An important distinction that is made in reporting fund balance is between 
amounts that are considered non-spendable (i.e., fund balance associated with assets that 
are not in spendable form, such as inventories or prepaid items, long-term portions of 
loans and notes receivable, or items that are legally required to be maintained intact (such 
as the corpus of a permanent fund)) and those that are spendable (such as fund balance 
associated with cash, investments or receivables). 

Amounts in the spendable fund balance category are further classified as restricted, 
committed, assigned or unassigned, as appropriate. 

Restricted fund balance represents amounts that are constrained either externally 
by creditors (such as debt covenants), contributors or laws or regulations of other 
governments; or by law, through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (Continued) 

Assets, Liabilities and Fund Equity, (Continued) 

Fund Balance, (Continued) 

Committed fund balance represents amounts that are useable only for specific 
purposes by formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making 
authority. Such amounts are not subject to legal enforceability (like restricted 
amounts), but cannot be used for any other purpose unless the government 
removes or changes the limitation by taking action similar to that which imposed 
the commitment. 

Assigned fund balance represents amounts that are intended to be used for 
specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed. Intent is expressed by 
the governing body itself, or a subordinated high-level body or official who the 
governing body has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for 
specific purposes. Assigned fund balances includes all remaining spendable 
amounts ( except negative balances) that are reported in governmental funds other 
than the general fund, that are neither restricted nor committed, and amounts in 
the general fund that are intended to be used for specific purpose in accordance 
with the provisions of the standard. 

Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for the general fund. It 
represents amounts that have not been assigned to other funds, and that have not 
been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the general 
fund. 

Resource Use Policy - It is the District's policy for all funds that when an 
expenditure/expense in incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted 
resources, including fund balances, are available, the District considers restricted 
amounts to be spent first before any unrestricted amounts are used. Furthermore, it is the 
District's policy that when an expenditure/expense is incurred for purposes for which 
committed, assigned, or unassigned resources, including fund balances, are available, the 
School considers committed amounts to be spent first, followed by assigned amounts and 
lastly unassigned amounts. 

F. Revenue, Expenses, and Expenditures 

State Revenues - Revenues from state sources for current operations are primarily 
governed by the state aid formula under the provisions of Article XVIII, Title 70, 
Oklahoma Statutes. The State Board of Education administers the allocation of state aid 
funds to school districts based on information accumulated from the districts.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, (Continued) 

Revenues, Expenses, and Expenditures, (Continued) 

State Revenues, (Continued) 

After review and verification of reports and supporting documentation, the State 
Department of Education may adjust subsequent fiscal period allocations of money for 
prior year errors disclosed by review. Normally, such adjustments are treated as 
reductions or additions of revenue of the year when the adjustments are made. 

The District receives revenue from the State to administer certain categorical educational 
programs. State Board of Education rules require that revenue earmarked for these 
programs be expended only for the program for which the money is provided and require 
that the money not expended as of the close of the fiscal year be carried forward into the 
following year to be expended for the same categorical programs. The State Department 
of Education requires that categorical educational program revenues be accounted for in 
the general fund. 

Interfund Transactions - Quasi-external transactions are accounted for as revenues, 
expenditures or expenses. Transactions that constitute reimbursements to a fund or 
expenditures/expenses initially made from it that are properly applicable to another fund 
are recorded as expenditures/expenses in the fund that is reimbursed. 

All other interfund transactions, except quasi-external transactions and reimbursements, 
are reported as transfers. Nonrecurring or non-routine permanent transfers of equity are 
reported as residual equity transfers. All other interfund transfers are reported as 
operating transfers. There were no operating transfers or residual equity transfers during 
fiscal year 2018. 

G. Statement of Cash Flows 

Since the District does not currently have any Proprietary Fund Types, the statement of 
cash flows has not been presented in the fiscal 2018 accompanying financial statements.

2. Deposits and Investments 

Custodial Credit Risk - Custodial credit risk exists when the District holds deposits or 
investments that are uninsured and uncollateralized. The District's cash deposits and 
investments at financial institutions as of June 30, 2018 was $2,391,395.33. The 
District's cash deposits, including interest-bearing certificates of deposit, were not 
entirely covered by Federal Depository Insurance (FDIC) or direct obligations of the U.S. 
Government insured or collateralized with securities held by the District or by its agent in 
the District's name. The District was short in the amount of $4,747.12 of having all 
funds collateralized. 

Investment Interest Rate Risk - Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest 
rates will adversely affect the fair market value of an investment. The District does not 
have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of managing 
its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. 

Investment Credit Risk - Investment credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other 
counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligation. The District does not have a 
formal investment policy limiting its investment choices, other than the limitation of state 
law as follows: 

•Direct obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities to 
which the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government is pledged, or obligations to 
the payment of which the full faith and credit of the State is pledged. 
•Certificates of deposits or savings accounts that are either insured or secured with 
acceptable collateral with in-state financial institutions, and fully insured certificates 
of deposit or savings accounts in out-of-state financial institutions. 
• With certain limitation, negotiable certificates of deposit, prime bankers 
acceptances, prime commercial paper and repurchase agreements with certain 
limitations. 
•County, municipal or school district tax supported debt obligations, bond or revenue 
anticipation notes, money judgments, or bond or revenue anticipation notes of public 
trusts whose beneficiary is a county, municipality or school district. 
•Notes or bonds secured by mortgage or trust deed insured by the Federal Housing 
Administrator and debentures issued by the Federal Housing Administrator, and in 
obligations of the National Mortgage Association. 
• Money market funds regulated by the SEC and in which investments consist of the 
obligations of the United States, its agencies and instrumentalities.

Concentration of Investment Credit Risk - Exposure to concentration of investment 
credit risk is considered to exist when investments in any one issuer represent a 
significant percent of total investments of the District (any over 5 percent are disclosed). 
Investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and investments in 
mutual funds, external investment pools, and other pooled investments are excluded from 
this consideration. The District places no limit on the amount it may invest in any one 
issuer. The District had no concentration of credit risk as defined above. 

3. Investment Income 

Investment income deposits are receipted as allocated by the Treasurer. School District 
Funds held by the Treasurer are required to be invested in accordance with Title 70 of the 
Oklahoma Statutes. Interest income on cash funds totaled $1,958.43. 

4. General Long-Term Debt 

State statutes prohibit the District from becoming indebted in an amount exceeding the 
revenue to be received for any fiscal year without approval by the District's voters. Bond 
issues have been approved by the voters arid issued by the District for various capital 
improvements. These bonds are required to be fully paid serially within 25 years from 
the date of issue. 

General long-term debt of the District consists of bonds payable and capital leases. 
Obligations for compensated absences and early retirement incentives have not been 
presented. Debt service requirements for bonds are payable solely from fund balance and 
future revenues of the debt service fund.

General Long-Term Debt (Continued) 

The District has entered into lease agreements as lessee, which qualify as capital leases 
for accounting purposes since title transfers at the end of the lease term and it has been 
recorded at the present value of the future minimum lease payments. The leases contain a 
clause, which gives the District the ability to terminate the lease agreements at the end of 
each fiscal year. The District records any current year payments on capital leases as 
expenditures and records a liability for future lease payment in the general long-term debt 
account group. 

A brief description of the outstanding capital leases at June 30, 2018, is set forth below: 

The District voters authorized and approved general obligation bonds. The bond 
proceeds are to be used for improvements including but not limited to the acquisition,

5. Employee Retirement System 

Plan Description - The District part1c1pates in the state-administered Oklahoma 
Teachers' Retirement System (the "System"), which is a cost-sharing, multiple-employer 
public employee retirement system (PERS) and is administered by the Board of Trustees 
of the System. The System provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-
living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. Title 70 
Sectionl 7 of the Oklahoma Statutes establishes benefit provisions and may be amended 
only through legislative action. The System issues a publicly available financial report 
that includes financial statements and required supplementary information that can be 
obtained by writing to the Oklahoma Teachers' Retirement System, P.O. Box 53524, 
Oklahoma City, OK 73152 or by calling (405) 521-2387. 

Basis of Accounting - The System's financial statements are prepared on the cash basis 
of accounting, except for accruals of interest income. Plan member contributions are 
recognized in the period in which the contributions are made. Benefits and refunds are 
recognized when paid. The pension benefit obligation is a standardized disclosure 
measure of the present value of pension benefits. This pension valuation method reflects 
the present value of estimated pension benefits that will be paid in future years as a result 
of employee services performed to date and is adjusted for the effect of projected salary 
increases. There are no actuarial valuations performed on individual school districts. 
The System has an under-funded pension benefit obligation as determined as part of the 
latest actuarial valuation. 

Funding Policy - Under the System, contributions are made by the District, the State of 
Oklahoma, and the participating employees. Participation is required for all teachers and 
other certified employees and is optional for all other regular employees of public 
educational institutions who work at least 20 hours per week. The contribution rates for 
the District, which are not actuarially determined, and its employees are established by 
statute and applied to the employee's earnings, plus employer-paid fringe benefits. The 
District is required by statute to contribute 9.5% of applicable compensation effective 
January 1, 2011 and thereafter. The District is allowed by the Oklahoma Teacher's

Funding Policy, (Continued) 

Retirement System to make the required contributions on behalf of the participating 
members. The required contribution for participating members is 7.0% of each member's 
total compensation. Contributions received by the System from the State of Oklahoma 
are used to offset required employer contributions by the local school district. In 
addition, if a member's salary is paid in part by federal or private funds, the contribution 
on that portion of the salary paid by those funds must be matched by the District at 
7.70%. 

Annual Pension Cost - The District's contributions to the System for the years ending 
June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 were $221,597.54, $217,288.00, and $223,547.00, 
respectively. 

6. Risk Management 

The District is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to and 
destruction of assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; or acts of God. The 
District purchases commercial insurance to cover these risks, including general and auto 
liability, property damage, and public officials liability. Settled claims resulting from 
these risks have not exceeded the commercial insurance coverage for the current year or 
three prior years. 

The District also participates in a risk pool for Workers' Compensation coverage in 
which there is a transfer or pooling of risks among the participants of that pool. In 
accordance with GASB No. 10, the School reports the required contribution to the pool, 
net of refunds, as insurance expense. The risk pool is the Oklahoma School Assurance 
Group (OSAG), an organization formed for the purpose of providing workers' 
compensation coverage to participating schools in the State of Oklahoma.

In that capacity, OSAG is responsible for providing loss control services and certain 
fiscal activities, including obtaining contract arrangements for the underwriting~ excess 
insurance agreements, claims processing, and legal defense for any and all claims 
submitted to them during the plan year. As a member of OSAG the District is required to 
pay fees set by OSG according to an established payment schedule. A portion of the fees 
paid by the District goes into a loss fund for the District. The fee for the loss fund is 
calculated by projecting losses based on the schools losses for the last five years. OSAG 
provides coverage in excess of the loss fund so the District's liability for claim loss is 
limited to the balance of the loss fund. If the District does not use their loss fund in three 
years it is returned to them with no interest. 

The District is also a member of the Oklahoma Public Schools Unemployment 
Compensation Program. In this program the District is required to contribute 1.6% of 
their taxable payroll for unemployment insurance. The funds for each district are kept 
separate and districts can contribute more than 1.6% of their payroll if they elect to. The 
money contributed by each District earns interest and is fully insured. If the District has 
claims in excess of the amount in their account they would be liable for the excess. 

7. Health Care Coverage 

8. 

During the year ended June 30, 2018, employees of the Carnegie Independent School 
District No. 33, Oklahoma, were covered by a health insurance plan (the Plan). The 
teachers and support personnel may elect to be covered by the Plan. The Plan was 
authorized by House Bill 1731, 1988 Oklahoma Legislature (7 4 0 .S. 1988, Supp. Section 
1301-1322) with the Oklahoma State and Education Employers Group Insurance Board. 

Contingencies 

Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to audit and adjustment 
by grantor agencies. Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may 
constitute a liability of the applicable funds. The amount, if any, of expenditures which 
may be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the District 
expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL 
OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND 

OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 

GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

To the Honorable Board of Education 
Carnegie Independent School District No. 33 
Carnegie, Caddo County, Oklahoma 

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United 
States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government 
Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the fund type and 
accomit group financial statements-regulatory basis of Carnegie Independent School District No. 
33, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018; and the related notes to the financial 
statements, which collectively comprise Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, 
Oklahoma's basic fmancial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated February 18, 
2019. As stated in our report, our opinion was adverse with respect to the fmancial statements 
not being prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of An)erica because the presentation followed the regulatory basis of the financial 
reporting provisions· of the Oklahoma State Department of Education. In addition, our opinion 
was qualified because the omission . of the General Fixed Assets Account Group results in an 
incomplete presentation with respect to the finandal statements being prepared following· the 
regulatory basis of the fmancial reporting provisions of the OkJ.ahoma State Department of 
Education. · 

lntemal Control over Financial Reporting 

In planning and performing our audit· of the fmancial statements, we considered Carnegie 
Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's internal control over fmancial reporting 
(internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for 
the purpose of expressing our opinions on the fmancial statements, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we do 
not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. 

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to 
prevent, or detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a 
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, ·such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be prevented, 
or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a 
combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

MEMBER OF AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
MEMBER OF OKLAHOMA SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUB UC ACCOUNTANTS 



Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph 
of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be 
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did 
not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

Compliance and:Other Matters 

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Carnegie Independent School District 
No. 33, Oklahoma's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests 
of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements, 
noncompliance with which could have . a direct and· material effect · on the determination of 
financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are 
required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards in the United States of America. 

Purpose of this Report 

This purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and 
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of 
the entity's internal control or on compliance; This report is an integral part of an audit 
performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's 
internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this·communication is not suitable for any other 
purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH 
MAJOR PROGRAM AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE 

REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 

To the Honorable Board ofEducation31 
Carnegie Independent School District No. 33 
Carnegie, Caddo County, Oklahoma 

Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 

We have audited Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's compliance with the 
types of compliance requirements described in the 0MB Compliance Supplement that could have a 
direct and material e:ffe.ct on each of Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. Carnegie Independent School District No. 
33, Oklahoma's major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor's results section of 
the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. 

Management's Responsibility 

Management is responsible for compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and 
conditions of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 

Auditor's Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of Carnegie Independent School 
District No. 33, Oklahoma's major federal programs based on our audit of the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial 
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United 
States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U~S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform 
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform 
Guidance). Those standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about Carnegie 
Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's compliance with those requirements and 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major 
federal program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of Carnegie Independent 
School District No. 33, Oklahoma's compliance. 

MEMBER OF AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
MEMBER OF OKLAHOMA SOCIETY OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 



Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 

In our opinion, Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma, complied, in all material 
respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and 
material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 

Management of Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma, is responsible for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our audit of compliance, we considered 
Carnegie Independent School District No. 33, Oklahoma's internal control over compliance with the 
types of requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to 
determine the auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on 
internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we 
do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over compliance. 

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control 
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their 
assigned :functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over 
compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such 
that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance 
requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. 
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement ofa federal 
program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet 
important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. 

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the 
first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. 
However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified. 

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our 
testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of 
the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR YEAR AUDIT FINDINGS 
JUNE 30, 2018 

PRIOR YEAR FINDINGS - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AUDIT 

Condition: The finding was a significant deficiency stating that we noted that 
there was a lack of controls over expenditure, credit card purchasing, 
documentation and review procedures which allowed unauthorized charges. 

Recommendation: It was recommended that the School implement a formal 
purchasing and credit card· policy that includes limited access to credit cards, 
submission of original receipts for all purchases that are signed by the actual 
purchaser, and an independent examination and review of the purchase orders, 
invoices and credit card statements each month to determine that expenditures and 
charges are school related and that all appropriate documentation is present. It 
was also recommended that the School's accounting personnel and management 
must continually monitor and review the expenditures and credit card purchases 
to ensure no improper expenditures occur. 

. Current Status: The School's credit card was cancelled in March of 2017. There 
were no similar findings noted in the audit for the year ended June 30, 2018. 

Condition: The finding was a significant deficiency stating that there was a lack 
of controls over payroll authorizations, payroll documentation requirements, and 
the corresponding review procedures for those items which allowed for 
unapproved overtime payments and an incorrect bonus payment. 

Recommendation: It was recommended that all payroll overtime payments be 
supported with documentation that includes the date worked, start time, end time, 
hours worked, services performed, payroll rate, and extended amounts with totals. 
The documentation must be signed and dated by the employee and then given to 
the employee's supervisor or management for their approval to help ensure the 
proper payment is made. Bonus payments for certified and non-certified 
employees should be documented in the board of education minutes and the actual 
bonus payments should be examined by management for proper calculations 
before the bonus checks are given to the employees. 

Current Status: The School has implemented policies and controls to ensure only 
proper payments for payroll are being made. There were no similar findings 
noted in the audit for the year ended June 30, 2018.
