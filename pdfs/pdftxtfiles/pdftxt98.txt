INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT 
 
Members of the City Council 
City of Blanchard, Oklahoma 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 
 
We have audited the accompanying modified cash basis financial statements of the government activities, the 
business-type activities, each major fund and the remaining fund information of the City of Blanchard, Oklahoma 
as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related notes to the financial, which collectively comprise the 
City’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.     
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with 
the modified cash basis of accounting described in Note 1.B; this includes determining that the modified cash basis 
of accounting is an acceptable basis for preparation of the financial statements in the circumstances.  Management 
is also responsible for design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and 
fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit 
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards 
applicable to financial audits contained in Governmental Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of 
the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.   
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements.  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.  In making those risk assessments, 
the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.   
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. 
 
Opinions 
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective 
modified cash basis financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, 
and the remaining fund information of the City of Blanchard, Oklahoma, as of June 30, 2018, and the respective 
changes in modified cash basis financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended 
in accordance with the modified cash basis of accounting described in Note 1.B.

Basis of Accounting 
 
We draw your attention to Note 1.B.of the financial statements, which describes the basis of accounting.  The 
financial statements are prepared on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a basis of accounting other than 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect 
to that matter. 
 
Other Matters 
Supplemental and Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise 
the City of Blanchard, Oklahoma basic financial statements.  
 
The management discussion and analysis and the Supplementary and Other Information, as listed in the table of 
contents, are presented for additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. The 
management discussion and analysis and the budgetary comparison information have not been subjected to the 
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an 
opinion or provide any assurance on them. 
 
The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal and state awards is presented for the purposes of additional 
analysis as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, 
Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, and is not a required part of the basic financial 
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the 
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.  The information has been 
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional 
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other 
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other 
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In 
our opinion the schedule of expenditures of federal and state awards is fairly stated, in all material respects, in 
relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. 
  
The accompanying schedule of cash balances is presented for the purposes of additional analysis and is not a required 
part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from 
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.

the basic financial statements as a whole.

consideration of the City’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain 
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters.  The purpose of that report is to

testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the City of Blanchard’s internal control over financial 
reporting or on compliance.  That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government 
Auditing Standards in considering the City’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

ABOUT THE CITY 
 
 
 The City of Blanchard is an incorporated municipality with a population of approximately 8,280 

located in McClain County in central Oklahoma. The City is a council-manager form of 
government.  The City is governed by a five-member Council and operates under state law and 
City ordinances through the three branches of democratic government: 

 
 Legislative – the City Council is a five-member governing body elected by the 

citizens, 4 by ward and 1 at-large.

The City’s Financial Reporting Entity 
 
This annual report includes all activities for which the City of Blanchard City Council is financially 
accountable. These activities, defined as the City’s financial reporting entity, are operated within separate 
legal entities that make up the primary government. 
 
The City’s financial reporting entity includes the following separate legal entities. 
 

 The City of Blanchard – an incorporated City that operates the public safety, streets and 
public works, health and welfare, culture and recreation, and administrative activities of the 
City – reported as the primary government  

 
 The Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority (BMIA) – public trust created 

pursuant to 60 O.S. § 176 to operate the water, wastewater, and sanitation services of the 
City, with the City Council members serving as the trustees – considered part of the 
primary government presentation for reporting purposes 

 
 The Blanchard Economic Trust Authority (BETA) – public trust created pursuant to 60 

O.S. § 176 to stimulate economic growth and development  of the City, with appointment 
of members by the City Council, with 2 members serving as trustees – considered part of 
the primary government presentation for reporting purposes 

 
In addition, as required by state law, all debt obligations incurred by the trusts must be approved by two-
thirds vote of the City Council. This is considered sufficient imposition of will to demonstrate financial 
accountability and to include the trusts within the City’s financial reporting entity. The public trusts do 
not issue separate annual financial statements. 
 
OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
The financial statements presented herein include all of the activities of the City of Blanchard (the 
“City”), the Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority (the “Municipal Improvement Authority”) and 
the Blanchard Economic Trust Authority (the “Economic Trust Authority”). Included in this report are 
government-wide statements for each of the two categories of activities - governmental and business-type. 
 
The government-wide financial statements present the complete financial picture of the City from the 
economic resources measurement focus using the modified cash basis of accounting.  They present 
governmental and business-type activities separately and combined.  For governmental activities, these 
statements tell how these services were financed in the short term as well as what remains for future 
spending.  Fund financial statements also report the City’s operations in more detail than the government-
wide statements by providing information about the City’s most significant funds.  These statements 
include all assets of the City (including infrastructure) as well as all liabilities (including long-term debt), 
within the context of the modified cash basis of accounting.

Reporting the City as a Whole 
 
The Statement of Net Position and Statement of Activities 
 
One of the most important questions to ask about the City’s finances is, “Has the City’s overall financial 
condition improved, declined or remained steady as a result of the period’s activities?”  The Statement of 
Net Position and the Statement of Activities report information about the City as a whole and about its 
activities in a way that helps answer this question.  You will need to consider other non-financial factors, 
however, such as changes in the City’s sales tax base, the condition of the City’s roads, and quality of 
service to assess the overall health of the City. You will also need to keep in mind that these government-
wide statements are prepared in accordance with the modified cash basis of accounting and include only 
those City assets and liabilities resulting from cash transactions. 
 
In the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, we divide the City into two kinds of 
activities:  Governmental activities - Most of the City’s basic services are reported here, including the 
police, fire, administration, and streets.  Sales taxes, franchise fees, fines, and state and federal grants 
finance most of these activities; and Business-type activities – Activities where the City charges a fee to 
customers to help cover all or most of the cost of certain services it provides are reported here.  The City’s 
water, sewer, and sanitation utilities and economic development activities are reported as business-type 
activities.  
 
Reporting the City’s Most Significant Funds - Fund Financial Statements 
 
Fund Financial Statements 
 
The fund financial statements provide detailed information about the City’s most significant (major) 
funds -- not the City as a whole.  Some funds are required to be established by State law and by debt 
covenants.  However, the City Council may also establish certain other funds to help it control and 
manage money for particular purposes or to show that it is meeting legal responsibilities for using certain 
taxes, grants, and other money.  The City’s two kinds of funds – governmental and proprietary - use 
different accounting approaches. 
 
Governmental funds - All of the City’s basic services are reported in governmental funds, which focus on 
how money flows into and out of those funds and the balances left at year-end that are available for 
spending.  Governmental funds report their activities on a modified cash basis of accounting and current 
financial resources measurement focus that is different from other funds. For example, these funds report 
the acquisition of capital assets and payments for debt principal as expenditures and not as changes to 
asset and debt balances.  The governmental fund statements provide a detailed short-term view of the 
City’s general government operations and the basic services it provides.  Governmental fund information 
helps you determine (through a review of changes to fund balance) whether there are more or fewer 
financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the City’s programs. The differences of 
results in the governmental fund financial statements to those in the government-wide financial statements 
are explained in a reconciliation following each governmental fund financial statement. 
 
Proprietary funds - When the City, mainly through the Municipal Improvement Authority, charges 
customers for the services it provides, these services are generally reported in proprietary funds.  
Proprietary funds are reported on the modified cash basis of accounting and an economic resources 
measurement focus. For example, proprietary fund capital assets are capitalized and depreciated and 
principal payments on long-term debt are recorded as a reduction to the liability.  The City’s proprietary

funds are the Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority that accounts for the operation of the water, 
sewer, and sanitation activities and the Blanchard Economic Trust Authority that accounts for economic 
development. 
 
 
Notes to the Financial Statements 
 
The notes provide additional information that is essential to gain an understanding of the data provided in 
the government-wide and fund financial statements.  The Notes to the Financial Statements can be found 
on pages 28-46 of this report. 
 
Other Information 
 
In addition to the basic financial statements and accompanying notes, this report also presents Budgetary 
Comparison Schedules for the General Fund, a federal and state award schedule, and a schedule of cash 
balances. 
 

THE CITY AS A WHOLE 
 
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, net position on a modified cash basis for the governmental and 
business-type activities increased by $513,126.

The largest portion of the City’s net position reflects its investment in capital assets, less any related debt 
used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding.  At year end, the net investment in capital assets, 
amounted to $15,151,010. 
 
Although the City’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related debt, it should be noted that 
the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets 
themselves cannot be used to liquidate these liabilities. 
 
Current assets of the governmental activities increased approximately $327,000 or 25% due primarily to 
increased sales and use tax collections. 
 
Current assets of the business-type activities decreased approximately $1,885,000 or 44% due primarily 
to the use of the 2014A Revenue Bonds and 2016 Revenue Notes proceeds received in previous years to 
construct and acquire improvements to the City’s water distribution and storage system.

 The City has seen an increase in sales tax due to increased oil and gas activity in FY19. 
 The City made changes to its water distribution contract which will significantly reduce the 

amount paid for water purchases in FY19. 
 The City paid off Capital Leases in FY18 which will reduce total debt payments in FY19. 
 Federal assistance is expected to be received for the Canadian River Waterline Crossing Project in 

FY19.  This reimbursement will be used to pay down debt.

Fund Balance – Net Position Reconciliation: 

 
 

 
Total fund balance, governmental funds 1,609,653$               

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the Statement of Net 
Position are different because:

Capital assets used in governmental activities are not current financial 
resources and therefore are not reported in this fund financial statement, but 
are reported in the governmental activities of the Statement of Net Position. 6,999,655                 

Some liabilities (such as Notes Payable and Capital Lease Contract Payable), 
are not due and payable in the current period and are not included in the 
fund financial statement, but are included in the governmental activities of 
the Statement of Net Position. (1,887,786)                

Net Position of Governmental Activities in the Statement of Net Position 6,721,522$

Changes in Fund Balances – Changes in Net Position Reconciliation: 
 

Net change in fund balances - total governmental funds: 324,961$                  

Amounts reported for Governmental Activities in the Statement of 
Activities are different because:

Governmental funds report outlays for capital assets as expenditures 
because such outlays use current financial resources.  In contrast,  the 
Statement of Activities reports only a portion of the outlay as expense.  
The outlay is allocated over the assets' estimated useful lives as 
depreciation expense for the period.
   Capital asset purchases capitalized
   Depreciation expense (499,567)                   
   Gain on disposal 2,496                        

Governmental funds report the entire net sales price (proceeds)  from 
sale of an asset as revenue because it provides current financial 
resources. In contrast,  the Statement of Activities reports only the gain 
or loss on the sale of the assets.  Thus, the change in net position 
differs from the change in fund balance by the cost of the asset sold. 
   Proceeds from disposed capital assets (74,498)                     

Debt proceeds provide current financial resources to governmental 
funds, but issuing debt increases long-term liabilities in the statement 
of net position.  Repayment of debt principal is an expenditure in the 
governmental funds, but the repayment reduces long-term liabilities in 
the Statement of Net Position:
   Principal payments on long-term debt 1,164,245                 
   Proceeds of long-term debt (809,250)                   

Some expenses reported in the statement of activities do not require the 
use of current financial resources and these are not reported as 
expenditures in governmental funds: 
Change in net position of governmental activities 253,849$                  

145,462

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
   
 A.  Financial Reporting Entity 

 
The City’s financial reporting entity includes three separate legal entities reported as the 
primary government as follows: 
 

 The City of Blanchard – operates the public safety, streets, health and welfare, 
culture and recreation, and administrative activities of the City.  
 

 The Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority (BMIA) – operates the 
water, wastewater and sanitation services of the City. The City of Blanchard is the 
beneficiary of the Trust and the City Council serves as the governing body of the 
Trust. 
 

 The Blanchard Economic Trust Authority (BETA) – stimulate economic growth 
and development of the beneficiary City. 
 

In determining the financial reporting entity, the City complies with the provisions of 
Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 14, “The Financial Reporting 
Entity” and Statement No. 61, “The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus” and includes all 
component units for which the City is financially accountable.  
 
The component units are Public Trusts established pursuant to Title 60 of Oklahoma State law.  
A Public Trust (Authority) has no taxing power.  The Authorities are generally created to 
finance City services through issuance of revenue bonds or other non-general obligation debt 
and to enable the City Council to delegate certain functions to the governing body (Trustees) of 
the Authorities.  The Authorities generally retain title to assets which are acquired or 
constructed with Authority debt or other Authority generated resources.  In addition, the City 
has leased certain existing assets at the creation for the Authorities to the Trustees on a long-
term basis.  The City, as beneficiary of the Public Trusts, receives title to any residual assets 
when either of the Public Trusts are dissolved. 
 
The City Council is the governing body (trustees) of the BMIA and the City is able to impose 
its will on the Authority through required approval of all debt obligations issued by this entity. 
 
The City Council appoints the governing body (trustees) of the BETA.  Two members of the 
City Council serve as trustees of the BETA.  
 
As required by state law, all debt obligations incurred by the above trusts must be approved by 
two-thirds vote of the City Council. This is considered sufficient imposition of will to 
demonstrate financial accountability and to include the trusts within the City’s financial 
reporting entity. The public trusts do not issue separate annual financial statements and are 
treated as blended component units.

B.  Basis of Presentation and Accounting 
 

Government-Wide Financial Statements: 
 
The statements of net position and activities are reported on a modified cash basis of 
accounting. The modified cash basis of accounting is based on the recording of cash and cash 
equivalents and changes therein, and only recognizes revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities 
resulting from cash transactions adjusted for modifications that have substantial support in 
generally accepted accounting principles. These modifications include adjustments for the 
following balances arising from cash transactions:  

 
 capital assets and the depreciation of those assets, where applicable 
 long-term debt 
 cash-based interfund receivables and payables 
 other cash-based receivables/payables 
 investments 
 utility deposit liabilities 

 
As a result of the use of this modified cash basis of accounting, certain assets and their related 
revenues (such as accounts receivable and revenue for billed or provided services not yet 
collected, and accrued revenue and receivables) and certain liabilities and their related expenses 
(such as accounts payable and expenses for goods or services received but not yet paid, and 
accrued expenses and liabilities) are not recorded in these financial statements. 
 
Program revenues within the statement of activities are derived directly from each activity or 
from parties outside the City’s taxpayers. The City has the following program revenues in each 
activity:  

  
 General government: License and permits and inspection fees and capital grants 
 Public safety:  Fine revenue, fire runs and operating and capital grants 
 Streets and highways: Gas excise, commercial vehicle taxes and impact fees and 

operating grants 
 Culture and recreation:  capital grants 

 
Governmental Funds: 
 
General Fund – The General Fund is the primary operating fund of the City and always 
classified as a major fund.  It is used to account for all financial resources not accounted for and 
reported in another fund. 
 
Special Revenue Funds – are used to account for and report the proceeds of specific revenues 
sources that are restricted or committed to expenditures for specified purposes other than debt 
service or capital projects. 
 
Capital Project Funds – are used to account for and report financial resources that are restricted, 
committed, or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays, including the acquisition or 
construction of capital facilities and other capital assets.

As of and for the Year Ended June 30, 2018

Proprietary Funds: 
 
Enterprise Funds – are used to account for business-like activities provided to the general 
public.  These activities are financed primarily by user charges and the measurement of 
financial activity focuses on net income measurement similar to the private sector.  The 
reporting entity includes the Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority (BMIA) enterprise 
fund and the Blanchard Economic Trust Authority (BETA) enterprise fund.  The BMIA fund 
accounts for activities of the public trust in providing, water, wastewater, and sanitation 
services to the public.  The BETA fund accounts for economic growth and development of the 
beneficiary City. 
 
 The City’s governmental funds are comprised of the following: 

 
Major Funds: 

 
 General Fund – accounts for all activities not accounted for in other special-purpose 

funds.  
 Capital Improvement Fund – accounts for sales tax restricted for capital improvement and 

capital improvement projects. 
 TIF District Fund – accounts for all activities of the Blanchard Economic Development 

Project Plan. 
 

The governmental funds are reported on a modified cash basis of accounting and current 
financial resources measurement focus. Only current financial assets and liabilities resulting 
from cash transactions are included on the fund balance sheets.  The operating statements 
present sources and uses of available spendable financial resources during a given period.  
These fund financial statements use fund balance as their measure of available spendable 
financial resources at the end of the period.  The reconciliation of the governmental funds 
financial statements to the governmental activities presentation in the government-wide 
financial statements is the result of the use of the economic resources measurement focus at the 
government-wide level. 

 
The City’s proprietary funds are comprised of the following: 
 
Major Fund: 
 

 Blanchard Municipal Improvement Authority – accounts for the operation of the water 
and wastewater services and the outsourcing of sanitation services. 

 
Non-Major Fund: 
 

 Blanchard Economic Trust Authority – established to promote development of 
economic beneficial projects for the benefit of the City of Blanchard and its citizens.  
Generally it is funded through loans from the City or fees from revenue bond issues. 

 
For purposes of the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position, operating 
revenues and expenses are considered those whose cash flows are related to operating activities, 
while revenues and expenses related to financing, capital and investing activities are reported as 
non-operating or transfers and contributions.

All of the above noted funds are legally required to adopt annual budgets or appropriations. The 
public trusts are not required to adopt legal annual appropriations. While each trust develops an 
annual budget, it is for financial management purposes and does not constitute legal 
appropriations. 
 
C.   Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments 

 
Cash and cash equivalents includes all demand and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, 
and any short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less, and open-end 
government mutual funds.  Investments consist of long-term certificates of deposits and are 
reported at cost. 
 
For the purposes of the statements of net position, balance sheets, and statement of cash flows, 
cash and cash equivalents includes all demand and savings accounts.  Trust account 
investments in open-ended mutual fund shares are also considered cash equivalents for 
reporting purposes.   
 
For the year ended June 30, 2018, the City recognized $22,524 of investment income.  Due to 
the minimal rates of return on allowable investments in the current environment, most of the 
City’s deposits are in demand and short-term time deposits. 

 
D.    Capital Assets and Depreciation  

 
Reported capital assets are limited to those acquired with cash and cash equivalents consistent 
with the modified cash basis of accounting.  The accounting treatment of property, plant and 
equipment (capital assets) depends on whether the assets are used in governmental fund type or 
proprietary fund operations and whether they are reported in the government-wide or fund 
financial statements. In the government-wide and proprietary fund financial statements, 
property, plant and equipment are accounted for as capital assets, net of accumulated 
depreciation where applicable.  In the governmental fund financial statements, capital assets 
acquired are accounted for as capital outlay expenditures and not reported as capital assets. 
 
Capital assets consist of land, land improvement, construction in progress, buildings and 
building improvements, machinery and equipment, and infrastructure. A capitalization 
threshold of $2,000 is used to report capital assets.  Capital assets are valued at historical cost 
or estimated historical cost if actual is unavailable. Estimated historical cost was used to value 
the majority of the assets acquired prior to July 1, 2003.  Prior to July 1, 2003, governmental 
funds’ infrastructure assets, such as streets, bridges, drainage systems, and traffic signal 
systems were not capitalized.  Infrastructure assets acquired with cash since July 1, 2003 are 
recorded at cost.  In-kind donations of capital assets are not recorded on the modified cash basis 
of accounting. 
 
Depreciable capital assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
lives.  The range of estimated useful lives by type of asset is as follows:  
 

 Buildings 15-39 years 
 Machinery, furniture and equipment 3-20 years 
 Infrastructure 15-50 years

E.    Long-Term Debt   

 
Reported long-term debt is limited to debt arising from cash transactions consistent with the 
modified cash basis of accounting.  Accounting treatment of long-term debt varies depending 
upon whether source of repayment is from governmental fund types or proprietary fund type 
resources and whether they are reported in the government-wide or fund financial statements.  
All long-term debt resulting from cash transactions to be repaid from governmental and 
business-type resources are reported as liabilities in the government-wide statements.  Long-
term debt for governmental funds is not reported as liabilities in the fund financial statements.  
The debt proceeds are reported as other financing sources and payment of principal and interest 
reported as expenditures.  The accounting for the proprietary fund is the same in the fund 
statements as it is in the government-wide statements.   
 
F.    Compensated Absences 

 
As a result of the use of the modified cash basis of accounting, liabilities related to accrued 
compensated absences are not recorded in the financial statements.  Expenditures/expenses 
related to compensated absences are recorded when paid.  The amount of accrued compensated 
absences for accumulated, unpaid compensatory time that would be due employees upon 
termination is reported as a commitment in Note 11. 

 
G.   Fund Balances and Net Position 

 
Fund Statements: 
      
Governmental fund equity is classified as fund balance.   Fund balance is further classified as 
nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned.  These classifications are 
defined as: 
 

a. Nonspendable – includes amounts that cannot be spent because they are either (a) not 
in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. 

b. Restricted – consists of fund balance with constraints placed on the use of resources 
either by (1) external groups such as creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or 
regulations of other governments, or (2) laws through constitutional provisions or 
enabling legislation. 

c. Committed – included amounts that can only be used for specific purposes pursuant 
to constraints imposed by formal action of the city’s highest level of decision-making 
authority. The City’s highest level of decision-making authority is made by 
ordinance. 

d. Assigned – includes amounts that are constrained by the city’s intent to be used for 
specific purposes but are neither restricted nor committed.  Assignments of fund 
balance may be made by city council action or management decision when the city 
council has delegated that authority.  Assignments for transfers and interest income 
for governmental funds are made through budgetary process. 

e. Unassigned – represents fund balance that has not been assigned to other funds and 
has not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the 
General Fund.

ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 

As of and for the Year Ended June 30, 2018

It is the City’s policy to first use restricted fund balance prior to the use of the unrestricted fund 
balance when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted 
fund balance are available.  The City’s policy for the use of unrestricted fund balance amounts 
require that committed amounts would be reduced first, followed by assigned amounts and then 
unassigned amounts when expenditures are incurred for purposes for which amounts in any of 
those unrestricted fund balance classifications could be used.   
 

Net Position: 
 
Net position is displayed in three components: 

 
 a. Net investment in capital assets - Consists of capital assets including restricted capital 

assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances of any 
bonds, mortgages, notes, or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, 
construction, or improvements of those assets. 

 
b. Restricted - Consists of net position with constraints placed on the use either by 1) 
external groups such as creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws and regulations of other 
governments, or 2) law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. 
 
c. Unrestricted - All other net position that does not meet the definition of “restricted” 
or “net investment in capital assets.” 

 
It is the City’s policy to first use restricted net position prior to the use of unrestricted net 
position when an expense is incurred for purposes for which both restricted and unrestricted net 
position is available. 

 
 

H.   Internal and Interfund Balances and Transfers 
 

The City’s policy is to eliminate interfund transfers and balances in the statement of activities 
and net position to avoid the grossing up of balances.  Only the residual balances transferred 
between governmental and business-type activities are reported as internal transfers and internal 
balances then offset in the total column in the government-wide statements.  Internal transfers 
and balances between funds are not eliminated in the fund financial statements. 

 
 

I.     Use of Estimates 
 

Certain estimates are made in the preparation of the financial statements, such as estimated 
lives for capital assets depreciation.  Estimates are based on management’s best judgments and 
may vary from actual results.

2.  Deposits and Investments 
 

For the year ended June 30, 2018, the City recognized $22,524 of investment income. Due to 
the minimal rates of return on allowable investments in the current environment, most of the 
City’s deposits are in demand and short-term time deposits. 
 
At June 30, 2018, the primary government held the following deposits and investments:

Restricted cash and cash equivalents 1,816,876        

4,021,369$      

 
 

Custody Credit Risk - Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the 
government deposits may not be returned to it.  The City is governed by the State Public 
Deposit Act which requires that the City obtain and hold collateral whose fair value exceeds the 
amount of uninsured deposits.  Investment securities are exposed to custody credit risk if the 
securities are uninsured, are not registered in the name of the government, and if held by either 
a counterparty or a counterparty’s trust, department or agent, but not in the government’s name.  

 
The City’s accounts were fully collateralized at June 30, 2018. 

 
Investment Interest Rate Risk - the City does not have a formal investment policy that limits 
investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from 
increasing interest rates.

Investment Credit Risk - The City has no investment policy that limits its investment choices 
other than the limitations of state law that generally authorize investments in:  (1) full faith and 
credit, direct obligations of the U. S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities, and the 
State of Oklahoma and certain mortgage insured federal debt; (2) certificates of deposit or 
savings accounts that are either insured or secured with acceptable collateral; (3) negotiable 
certificates of deposit, prime bankers acceptances, prime commercial paper and repurchase 
agreements with certain limitations;  (4) county, municipal or school district tax supported debt 
obligations, bond or revenue anticipation notes, money judgments, or bond or revenue 
anticipation notes of public trusts whose beneficiary is a county, municipality or school district; 
and government money market funds regulated by the SEC. These investment limitations do 
not apply to the City’s public trusts.   

 
As of June 30, 2018, no securities were held by the City.  

Concentration of Investment Credit Risk - the City places no limit on the amount it may invest 
in any one issuer.  

Restricted Cash and Investments – The amounts reported as restricted assets on the statement of 
net position are comprised of amounts restricted for utility deposits, special assessments, debt 
service, debt reserve, or construction purposes.  The restricted assets as of June 30, 2018 are as

9. Risk Management 

 
The City is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, or destruction of 
assets; errors and omissions; injuries to employees; employee health and life; and natural disasters.   
The City manages these various risks of loss as follows: 
 

 General Liability, Fleet Coverage, and Physical Property – Covered through participation 
in Oklahoma Municipal Assurance Group risk entity pool. 

 Workers’ Compensation – Workers’ compensation is covered through participation in 
Consolidated Benefits Resources. 

 Employee’s Group Health and Life – Covered through participation in commercial 
insurance-Blue Cross Blue Shield through OPEH&W. 

 
The City’s risk is transferred to the risk entity pool except for claim deductible amounts.  The risk 
pool maintains deposits for claims reserves and other purposes for the benefit of the City.    
Management believes such insurance coverage listed above is sufficient to preclude any significant 
uninsured losses to the City, and such claims have not exceeded the coverage over the past three 
fiscal years.

Litigation: 
The City and its public trusts are parties to various legal proceedings or have threatened litigation 
which normally occurs in the course of municipal governmental operations.  The financial statements 
do not include accruals or provisions for loss contingencies that may result from these proceedings.  
State Constitution and statutes provide for the levy of an ad valorem tax over a three-year period by a 
Sinking Fund for the payment of any court assessed judgment rendered against the City. (This 
provision is not available to public trusts.)  While the outcome of the above noted proceedings or 
threatened litigation cannot be predicted, due to the insurance coverage maintained by the City and 
the State statute relating to judgments, the City feels that any settlement or judgment not covered by 
insurance would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the City. 
 
Federal and State Award Programs: 
 
The City of Blanchard participates in various federal or state grant/loan programs from year to year.  
The grant/loan programs are often subject to additional audits by agents of the granting or loaning 
agency, the purpose of which is to ensure compliance with the specific conditions of the grant or loan.  
The City has not been notified of any noncompliance with federal or state award requirements.  
 
Construction and Other Major Significant Commitments: 
 
The City has outstanding amounts owed on contracts with J&C Construction for the fire hydrant 
relocation project in the amount of $53,300 and with Jordan Contractors for the downtown sanitary 
sewer rehab project in the amount of $355,910.  
 
12.  Assessment District Revenue 

  
Street Assessment District 
 
On February 17, 2014, pursuant to the request of specific owners of specific tracts of property located 
in the Fox Run I and Fox Run II subdivisions, the City established the Fox Run I and Fox Run II 
Street Improvement District.  Ordinance No. 597 established the assessment district and set forth the 
terms of the assessment necessary to repay the street improvement debt incurred by the BMIA on 
behalf of the Fox Run I and Fox Run II property owners.  A note payable to First National Bank-
Chickasha of $420,000 payable in annual installments over ten years with an interest rate of 3.25%, 
was obtained to pay for the street improvement project.   
 
Each tract owner was assessed their prorated share of the debt plus 5% interest payable in ten annual 
installments to be billed by the McClain County Treasurer.  The assessment will be paid to the 
McClain County Treasurer and the Treasurer will remit the payments to the City, who then transfers 
the monies to the BMIA for its use in funding debt service on the note. 
 
The assessment, as determined by the amortization schedule of the debt, is submitted to the McClain 
County Treasurer by the City no later than October 1 of each year.  The County Treasurer, upon 
receipt of the certified assessment, levies the assessment on the Fox Run I and Fox Run II Street 
Improvement District tract owners by submitting a bill to each owner with a due date of December 
31. The tract owners must pay within 15 days after the due date or the County charges them a penalty 
of 1.5% of the assessment per month. The County remits assessments and penalties to the BMIA. 
Early payoffs of assessment balances may be paid to the Finance Director at any time and shall 
include interest accrued on the deferred balance.

Delinquent installment payments result in foreclosure on the tract or parcel of land and sold in the 
manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on land.  Any real estate sold under any 
order judgment may be redeemed by the owner or his assignee at any time within one year of the date 
of sale by paying to the purchaser the amount paid with interest from the date of purchase at the rate 
of 12% per year. 
 
13.  Subsequent Events 
 
The City was awarded a Safe Oklahoma Grant in the amount of $72,946 on August 24, 2018 for the 
purchase of technology to support violent crime intervention and enforcement and for overtime funds 
to target violent crime.  Also, the City approved the lease-purchase of four (4) police interceptors for 
$140,000 and four (4) ½ ton Chevy Pickups for $130,000.  The City approved $386,458 of TIF 
improvements along NE 10th Street, and $300,000 for Old Town water line rehab.   The City is 
working with ODOT to realign 10th Street and Morgan.  The funding will be 80% ODOT, 20% City 
with the City being responsible for engineering, easement clearing and utility replacement or removal 
in addition to the 20% match.

Footnotes to Budgetary Comparison Schedules: 
 
1. The budgetary comparison schedules are reported on the same modified cash basis as governmental 
funds within the basic financial statements. For budgetary comparison purposes, the City considers all 
encumbrances to lapse at year-end; therefore encumbrances are not considered expenditures for 
budgetary comparison purposes.  However, the City will re-appropriate these lapsed encumbrances in 
the subsequent year budget. 
 
2.  The legal level of appropriation control is the department level within a fund. Transfer 
appropriations require the City Manager’s approval and supplemental appropriations require City 
Council’s approval.

INTERNAL CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE INFORMATION 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
 
Members of the City Council 
City of Blanchard, Oklahoma 
 
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America 
and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States, the accompanying modified cash basis financial statements of 
the governmental activities, the business-type activities, each major fund and the remaining fund 
information of the City of Blanchard, Oklahoma, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2018, and the related 
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the City’s basic financial statements and have 
issued our report thereon dated December 6, 2018.  Our report included an emphasis of matter paragraph 
on the City’s use of the modified cash basis of accounting. 
 
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit, we considered the City's internal control over financial reporting 
(internal control) to determine the audit procedure that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose 
of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
the effectiveness of the City’s internal control.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the City’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management 
or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct 
misstatements on a timely basis.  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in 
internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s 
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant 
deficiency is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a 
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.   
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material 
weaknesses or, significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses 
may exist that have not been identified.

Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the City's financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts.  However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The 
results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported 
under Government Auditing Standards. 
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM 
AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM 

GUIDANCE 
 
 
Members of the City Council 
City of Blanchard, Oklahoma 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited City of Blanchard’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in 
the OMB Circular Compliance Supplement that could have direct and material effect on each of the City’s 
major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018.  The City’s major federal programs are identified 
in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.   
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with the federal statutes, regulations, and terms and conditions 
of its federal awards applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the City’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of types of compliance requirements referred to above.  We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and the Audit Requirements 
for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). These standards and the Uniform Guidance require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal 
program occurred.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the City’s compliance with 
those requirements and performing such other procedures we considered necessary in the circumstances.   
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on the compliance for each major 
program.  However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the City’s compliance. 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program  
 
In our opinion, the City of Blanchard, Oklahoma complied, in all material respects, with the types of 
compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on the major federal 
programs for the year ending June 30, 2018.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance 
 
Management of the City is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the City’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal control over compliance.  Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
City’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis.  A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will 
not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  A significant deficiency in internal control 
over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a 
type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal 
control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.   
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over 
compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.  We did not identify any 
deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, 
material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.  
 
Purpose of This Report 
 
The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing on the requirements of Uniform Guidance.  
Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.
