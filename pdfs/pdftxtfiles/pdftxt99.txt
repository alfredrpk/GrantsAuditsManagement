INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT 

 
To the Board of Directors 
BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC. 
 
Report on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of BRECKENRIDGE MANOR INC., Project No. 
117-HD034, (the Project) which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, 
and the related statements of activities and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements.  
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes 
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair 
presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. 
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment 
of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making 
those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair 
presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness 
of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  

Opinion 
 
In our opinion, the financial statement referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Project as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for 
the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of 
America. 
 
Other Matters 
 
Other Information 
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The 
accompanying supplementary information is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by 
the Consolidated Audit Guide for Audits of HUD Programs issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, Office of the Inspector General, and is not a required part of the financial statements. 
The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required 
part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived 
from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial 
statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the 
financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such 
information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements 
or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing 
standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly 
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.  
 
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards 
 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated September 21, 
2018, on our consideration of the Project’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its 
compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. 
The purpose of that report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting 
and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal control over 
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance 
with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Project’s internal control over financial reporting 
and compliance.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
(A) ORGANIZATION AND PRESENTATION 
 

BRECKENRIDGE MANOR (the Project) is a 18 unit residential apartment complex located in 
Guthrie, Oklahoma.   The Project is operated under Section 811 of the National Affordable Housing 
Act for low-income persons with disabilities.  Such projects are regulated by the U. S. Department 
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as to rent charges and operating methods.  The Project 
also is subject to a Project Rental Assistance Contract (PRAC) agreement with HUD. A significant 
portion of the Project’s rental income is received from HUD.  The Project’s major program is the 
Section 811 Capital Advance. 

 
 (B) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
   
 1. Basis of Accounting 

 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, 
include only the transactions of the Project, and do not represent the financial statements of the 
Corporation. 
 

 2. Basis of Presentation 
 

Financial statement presentation follows the recommendations of the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 958, update 2016-14.  
Under those provisions, net assets and revenues, gains, and losses are classified as without donor 
imposed restrictions or with donor imposed restrictions based on the existence or absence of 
donor imposed restrictions. The project currently has no donor imposed restrictions on net assets 
nor does it have any board imposed restrictions. All net assets are accounted for as without donor 
restrictions. 
 

 3. Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost when acquired. Depreciation is computed using the 
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are 
charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures greater than $1,500, which are new capital 
additions or significantly extends the life of the fixed asset, are capitalized. The cost of property 
and equipment sold or retired and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the 
accounts when the asset is sold or retired and any resulting gain or loss is included in operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
(B) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT.) 
 
 4. Income Taxes 
 

The Project is a not-for-profit organization that is exempt from income taxes under Section 501 
(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Project is not a private foundation within the meaning 
of Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, no provision for current or deferred 
income tax liability is recognized in the Project’s books or records. The Project does not believe 
that it has engaged in any activity that would result in an uncertain tax position. As a result, 
management does not believe that any uncertain tax position currently exists and no loss 
contingency has been recognized in the accompanying financial statements. Federal and state 
income tax statues dictate that tax returns filed in any of the previous three reporting periods 
remain open to examination. Currently, the Project has no open examination with either the 
Internal Revenue Service or state taxing authorities. 

 
 5. Distributions 

 
The housing project is a not-for-profit operation and therefore, the HUD Regulatory Agreement 
states that there will be no distributions of surplus cash from current or future operations to any 
of its officers or directors. 

  
 6. Cash and Cash Equivalents 

 
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Project considers all highly liquid debt 
instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  
 

 7. Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts 
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.   
 

 8. Rent Increases 
 
Under the Regulatory Agreement, the Project may not increase rents charged to tenants without 
prior HUD approval.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 
(C) TENANT SECURITY DEPOSITS - Tenant security deposits are held in separate accounts in the 

name of the Project.  At June 30, 2018, the cash set aside in the separate bank account equaled the 
security deposit liability account. 

 
(D) REPLACEMENT RESERVE - In accordance with the provisions of the HUD Regulatory 

Agreement, restricted cash is held in an interest-bearing checking account to be used for the 
replacement of property and other project expenditures with the approval of HUD. The required 
monthly deposit into this reserve account of $265.33 per month, were made during the year as agreed.  

 
(E) RESIDUAL RECEIPTS – Use of the residual receipts account is contingent upon HUD’s prior 

written approval. All deposits to the account are made from the yearly surplus cash calculation. There 
was $7,874 in surplus cash during the June 30, 2016 year, which the property was to place into the 
replacement reserve account to be accounted for separately as residual receipts. Only $1,500 of the 
$7,874 was deposited into the residual receipts account leaving a shortage of $6,374. Management 
deposited the remaining funds into the account during September, 2017 (see Prior Year Finding 2017-
0001). There is $8,996 in surplus cash in the current year to be deposited into the residual receipts 
account after completion of the audit. 

 
(F) ESCROW DEPOSITS –The Property maintains a separate bank account for insurance and audit 

escrow. There was no balance in the account as of June 30, 2018. 
 
(G) PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment at June 30, 2018, is summarized as 

follows: 
 

Land  $         34,000 
Buildings and Improvements  916,099 
Building Equipment  30,169 
Furniture  4,889 
   
Total  $      985,157 

 
All property and equipment are pledged as collateral for the capital advance.  Building and 
improvements are depreciated over 40 year and furniture and equipment over 5-7 year on the straight 
line method.   

 
(H) ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE – During prior periods, the Project was included in 

insurance policies with Logan County Association for Retarded Citizens dba New Horizons. The 
annual reimbursements from the Project to New Horizons were in excess of New Horizons share of 
the insurance costs. The excess payments are being repaid by New Horizons at a rate of $500 per 
month. These payments were made as agreed during the year. As of June 30, 2018, the balance due 
to the Project was $14,840.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 

(I)  MANAGEMENT FEE - The Project entered into an agreement with Pearson Property Management, 
LLC to manage the property. The management fee for the year ended June 30, 2018 was paid as 
agreed. 

 
(J)   CAPITAL ADVANCE - The Project entered into a Mortgage note with HUD in 2005 for $994,700, 

for the construction of a housing facility for low income persons with disabilities. The advance is 
secured by a mortgage on all property and all funds received by the Project. The advance bears no 
interest and requires no repayment so long as the housing remains available for no less than forty 
years for low-income persons with disabilities. 

 
(K) REGULATORY AGREEMENT - Certain agreements are in effect between the Corporation and 

HUD which regulate the activities of the Project. HUD makes housing assistance payments on behalf 
of qualified individuals and families. To ensure the Project remains well maintained and managed, 
HUD imposes certain restrictions upon the Corporation. These restrictions included tenant rental 
charges, maintenance, marketing, accounting and record keeping.  The regulatory agreement 
stipulates that the Project will not make distributions of assets or income to any of its officers or 
directors. 

 
The Project's major HUD program is the Section 811 Capital Advance.  The Project's non-major 
HUD program is the Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program. 
 

 
(L) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - The carrying 

amounts of cash equals its fair value.  It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the long-term 
debt because of the unique nature of the Project and its dependence on the HUD housing assistance 
payments. 

 
(M)  CURRENT VULNERABILITY DUE TO CERTAIN CONCENTRATIONS - The Project’s sole 

operating asset is a 18-unit apartment project.  The Project’s operations are concentrated in the 
multifamily real estate market.  In addition, the Project operates in a heavily regulated environment.  
The operations of the Project are subject to the administrative directives, rules and regulations of 
federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, HUD. Such administrative 
directives, rules and regulations are subject to acts of Congress and administrative changes mandated 
by HUD.  Such changes may occur with little notice or inadequate funding to pay for the related 
costs, including the additional administrative burden, to comply with changes.    

 
(N) IDENTITY OF INTEREST – The executive director of the sponsor agency is the manager of the 

Project. The manager was paid $10,800 for manager’s salary in the current year. 
 
(O)  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS - Subsequent events have been evaluated by management through the 

date of the audit report, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
Board of Directors 
BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC.  

   
We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued 
by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, 
INC., (the Project), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and 
the related statements of activities, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the 
financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated September 21, 2018.  
 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Project’s internal control 
over financial reporting (internal control) to determine the audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Project’s internal control. 
 
A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management 
or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in 
internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s 
financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant 
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a 
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.  
 
Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this 
section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses 
or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in 
internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that 
have not been identified.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL 
REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF 

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  
GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS 

 
Compliance and Other Matters 
 
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Project’s financial statements are free from 
material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, 
contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the 
determination of financial statement amounts. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those 
provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results 
of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under 
Government Auditing Standards.  
 
Purpose of this Report 
 
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance 
and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with 
Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, 
this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY  

THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
Board of Directors 
BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC. 
 
Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program 
 
We have audited BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC., (the Project) compliance with the types of compliance 
requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on 
each of the Project’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2018. The Project’s major federal 
programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings 
and questioned costs.  
 
Management’s Responsibility 
 
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants 
applicable to its federal programs. 
 
Auditor’s Responsibility 
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance for each of the Project’s major federal programs 
based on our audit of the types of compliance requirements referred to above. We conducted our audit of 
compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the 
standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the 
Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for 
Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Those standards and the uniform guidance require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether noncompliance with the types of compliance 
requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program 
occurred. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence about the Project’s compliance with those 
requirements and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  
 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal 
program. However, our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Project’s compliance.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY 

THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
Opinion on Each Major Federal Program 
 
In our opinion, the Project complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements 
referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the 
year ended June 30, 2018. 
 
Other Matters 
 
The results of our auditing procedures disclosed no instances of noncompliance, which is required to be 
reported in accordance with the Uniform Guidance.  
 
Report on Internal Control over Compliance  

Management of the Project is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over 
compliance with the types of compliance requirements referred to above. In planning and performing our 
audit of compliance, we considered the Project’s internal control over compliance with the types of 
requirements that could have a direct and material effect on each major federal program to determine the 
auditing procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing an opinion on 
compliance for each major federal program and to test and report on internal control over compliance in 
accordance with The uniform guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness 
of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the 
Project’s internal control over compliance. 
 
A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over 
compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned 
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a 
federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, 
or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility 
that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be 
prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.  
 
Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first 
paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance 
that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal 
control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses.  However, material weaknesses may 
exist that have not been identified.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR PROGRAM AND 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE REQUIRED BY 

THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE 
 
A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less 
severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention 
by those charged with governance. 
 
 
The purpose of this report of internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing 
of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform 
Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT’S REPORT ON APPLYING 
AGREED-UPON PROCEDURE 

Board of Directors 
BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC. 
 
We have performed the procedure described in the second paragraph of this report, which was agreed to 
by BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC., (the Project) and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, Public Indian Housing-Real Estate Assessment Center (PIH-REAC), solely to assist them 
in determining whether the electronic submission of certain information agrees with the related hard copy 
documents included within the OMB Uniform Guidance reporting package.  The Project is responsible for 
the accuracy and completeness of the electronic submission. This agreed-upon procedure engagement was 
conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants and the standards applicable to attestation engagements contained in Government Auditing 
Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The sufficiency of the procedure is 
solely the responsibility of those parties specified in this report. Consequently, we make no representation 
regarding the sufficiency of the procedure described below either for the purpose for which this report has 
been requested or for any other purpose. 
 
We compared the electronic submission of the items listed in the “UFRS Rule Information” column with 
the corresponding printed documents listed in the “Hard Copy Documents” column. The results of the 
performance of our agreed-upon procedure indicate agreement or non-agreement of the electronically 
submitted information and hard copy documents as shown in the attached chart. 
 
We were engaged to perform an audit in accordance with the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of 
the Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit 
Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), by the Project as of and for the year ended June 
30, 2018, and have issued our reports thereon dated September 21, 2018.  The information in the “Hard 
Copy Documents” column was included within the scope, or was a by-product of that audit.  Further, our 
opinion on the fair presentation of the supplementary information dated September 21, 2018, was expressed 
in relation to the basic financial statements of BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC., Inc. taken as a whole. 
 
A copy of the reporting package required by the Uniform Guidance, which includes the auditor’s reports, 
is available in its entirety from the Project.  We have not performed any additional auditing procedures 
since the date of the aforementioned audit reports.  Further, we take no responsibility for the security of the 
information transmitted electronically to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, PIH-
REAC. 
 
This report is intended solely for the information and use of BRECKENRIDGE MANOR, INC., and the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, PIH-REAC, and is not intended to be and should 
not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
